      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nWhat writer is quoted by Merriam-Webster for the Word of the Day from June 27, 2022?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves identifying a writer quoted by Merriam-Webster.\n   - It relates specifically to the Word of the Day for June 27, 2022.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific Word of the Day for June 27, 2022, on the Merriam-Webster website or archive.\n   - The writer or source quoted by Merriam-Webster for that Word of the Day.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None in this context appear necessary; the request relies on direct information likely archived online.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - While there is no specific hunch, it is possible that commonly quoted writers like Shakespeare or Mark Twain could feature, but this is speculative without data.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Use WebSurfer to access the Merriam-Webster website or their Word of the Day archive.\n- Search for the Word of the Day for June 27, 2022.\n- Identify the writer quoted in the context of the Word of the Day.\n- Report back the name of the writer."
