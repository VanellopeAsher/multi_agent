If there's a tie for a number of athletes, return the first in alphabetical order. Give the IOC country code as your answer.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request pertains to finding the country with the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics.\n   - The response should be in the form of the IOC country code.\n   - If there's a tie in the number of athletes, the country that comes first alphabetically should be returned.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The number of athletes sent by each country to the 1928 Summer Olympics. This might be found in historical records or database sites such as the official Olympics website, sports-reference sites, or reputable historical sports archives.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which country had the least number of athletes by comparing the data once acquired.\n   - Identify if there are any ties in the number of athletes among countries and deduce which comes first alphabetically.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The countries with the least athletes might be smaller nations, nations with less participation in that era, or nations emerging from colonial rule during that time period.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Have WebSurfer perform a search for the list of countries and their corresponding number of athletes who participated in the 1928 Summer Olympics.\n- Instruct WebSurfer to identify and verify a source, such as an official Olympic history page or a reputable sports statistics website, to obtain accurate data.\n- Once the list is obtained, Assistant will analyze the data to determine which country had the least number of athletes. If there are ties, Assistant will sort the countries alphabetically to find the correct answer.\n- Return the IOC country code of the country with the least athletes, respecting alphabetical order in case of a tie."

Still, it was obliged to give way to war-torn \nAntwerp in \nBelgium for the \n1920 Games and \nPierre de Coubertin's \nParis for the \n1924 Games. \nThe only other candidate city for the 1928 Olympics was \nLos Angeles, which would eventually be selected to host the Olympics four years later. In preparation for the \n1932 Summer Olympics, the \nUnited States Olympic Committee reviewed the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games. The committee reported a total cost of \nUS$1.183 million with receipts of US$1.165 million, giving a negligible loss of US$18,000, which was a considerable improvement over the 1924 Games.\n[2]The United States won the most gold and medals overall. \nHost city selection[edit]Dutch nobleman Frederik van \nTuyll van Serooskerken first proposed Amsterdam as the host city for the \nSummer Olympic Games in 1912, even before the \nNetherlands Olympic Committee was established. \nThe Olympic Games were canceled in 1916 due to \nWorld War I. In 1919, the Netherlands Olympic Committee abandoned the proposal of Amsterdam in favor of their support for the nomination of \nAntwerp as host city for the \n1920 Summer Olympics. In 1921, \nParis was selected for the \n1924 Summer Olympics on the condition that the 1928 Summer Olympics would be organized in Amsterdam. This decision, supported by the Netherlands Olympic Committee, was announced by the \nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) on 2 June 1921. \nLos Angeles' bid for the 1928 Summer Olympics was unsuccessful in 1922 and again in 1923.\n[3] The city was eventually selected as host city for the \n1932 Summer Olympics, being the only bidder for that year.\n[4]: p.915 Highlights[edit]This section contains a \nlist of miscellaneous information. Please relocate any relevant information into other sections or articles. \n(February 2025)These were the first Olympics to be organized under the \nIOC presidency of \nHenri de Baillet-Latour.\nA symbolic fire was lit for the first time during the Olympics, a tradition that continues today.\n[5] The first \nOlympic flame and torch relay, however, would not take place until the \n1936 Summer Olympics.\nFor the first time, the parade of nations started with \nGreece, which holds the origins of the Olympics, and ended with the host country, a tradition that has continued ever since.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

Francis, the Mayor of St. Louis). The Queen had initially refused to appear at either the opening or closing ceremony; it is thought that she objected to the Netherlands hosting the 1928 Games as she considered the Olympics a demonstration of paganism.\n[8] However, she returned from Norway before the conclusion of the Games, to be present at the closing ceremony,\n[9] and she presented the first prizes at the prize distribution which was held immediately beforehand.\n[4]: p.913 The American company \nCoca-Cola made its first appearance as an official sponsor of the Olympic Games, remaining the oldest Olympic sponsor to this day.\n[10]Many cars were expected for the Games, but Amsterdam had at most 2,000 single-car parking spaces. Consequently, several new parking sites were provided, and a special parking symbol was launched to show foreign visitors where they could park. The white P on a blue background was to become the international traffic sign for parking, which is still used today.\n[11][12]These Games were the first to bear the name \"Summer Olympic Games\", to distinguish them from the \nWinter Olympic Games (held since 1924).\nThese Games were the first to feature a fixed schedule of sixteen days, which is still followed since 1984. In previous Olympics, competition had been stretched out over several months.\nAthletics events were held on a 400-meter track, later becoming the standard for athletics tracks.\nGermany returned to the Olympic Games for the first time since 1912, after being banned from the 1920 and 1924 Games due to its role in \nWorld War I. The German team immediately finished second in the 1928 medal count.\nSouth American \nfootball made a definite breakthrough, as \nUruguay retained its title by defeating \nArgentina.\nIndia took its first ever gold medal in \nfield hockey, beginning a streak of six consecutive gold medals in the sport.\nAthlete highlights[edit]Paavo Nurmi of \nFinland won his ninth, and final, gold medal in the \n10,000 m race.\nCanadian athlete \nPercy Williams exceeded expectations by winning both the \n100 m and \n200 m sprint events.\nCrown Prince Olav, who would later become King of Norway, won a gold medal in the \n6 meter sailing event.\nPat O'Callaghan won the first ever medal for a newly independent \nIreland, taking gold in the \nhammer throw.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

Five women's athletics events were added: 100 meters, 800 meters, high jump, discus, and 400 meter hurdles. In protest of the limited number of events, British women athletes, boycotted the Games.\n[16] \nHalina Konopacka of \nPoland became the first female Olympic track and field champion. Reports that the 800 meter run ended with several of the competitors being completely exhausted were widely (and erroneously) circulated. As a result, the IOC decided that women were too frail for long-distance running, and women's Olympic running events were limited to 200 meters until the 1960s.\n[17]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

Reports that the 800 meter run ended with several of the competitors being completely exhausted were widely (and erroneously) circulated.

If there's a tie for a number of athletes, return the first in alphabetical order. Give the IOC country code as your answer.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request pertains to finding the country with the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics.\n   - The response should be in the form of the IOC country code.\n   - If there's a tie in the number of athletes, the country that comes first alphabetically should be returned.\n   - The Wikipedia page for the 1928 Summer Olympics is expected to have a section detailing the number of athletes per country.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The number of athletes sent by each country to the 1928 Summer Olympics by consulting the 'Participating nations' or 'Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees' section on reputable sources such as the Wikipedia page, official Olympics site, or sports archives.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which country had the least number of athletes by comparing the data once acquired.\n   - Identify if there are any ties in the number of athletes among countries and deduce which comes first alphabetically.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Smaller nations, those with less developed sports programs during the 1920s, or nations newly sovereign post-colonial rule might have sent fewer athletes.\n   - Countries making their Olympic debut or with limited resources might also have smaller delegations.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of Previous Failure\n**Root Cause:**\n- The primary issue was not locating the specific section or table that lists the number of athletes by country and their respective IOC codes on the Wikipedia page. Navigating the page was challenging, and the focus wasn't on the content that directly addressed the task.\n### New Plan\n- **Start with a Defined Search:** Directly search for pages or sections specifically titled \"1928 Summer Olympics participating nations\" or \"number of athletes by country 1928 Olympics.\"\n- **Efficient Navigation:** Use the page's table of contents or search function (Ctrl+F) on the page to quickly find relevant sections related to participating nations or athlete numbers.\n- **Validate Sources:** Ensure that the source providing the information is reliable, such as a subsection on Wikipedia clearly titled with the needed details, or an official sports archive.\n- **Data Extraction:** Focus on extracting the list of countries with the corresponding number of athletes and their IOC codes.\n- **Analysis:** Once data is obtained, identify the country with the least number of athletes and apply alphabetical sorting if there's a tie.\n- **Implementation of Plan:**\n  1. Use WebSurfer to efficiently locate and extract the necessary data from a recognized section or table.\n  2. If Wikipedia doesn't offer clear information, try other reputable sources like the official Olympic database.\n  3. Review the data and apply sorting logic to determine the correct IOC code. \nFollowing these steps will help in avoiding previous navigation challenges and focus on retrieving and analyzing the correct information systematically."

If there's a tie for a number of athletes, return the first in alphabetical order. Give the IOC country code as your answer.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request pertains to finding the country with the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics.\n   - The response should be in the form of the IOC country code.\n   - If there's a tie in the number of athletes, the country that comes first alphabetically should be returned.\n   - The Wikipedia page for the 1928 Summer Olympics includes sections potentially named 'Participating nations' or 'Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees'.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Navigate to the Wikipedia page for the 1928 Summer Olympics and access the section that lists the number of athletes by country.\n   - If Wikipedia doesn't have the data, check other reliable sources like the official Olympics site or sports archives.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which country had the least number of athletes by examining the extracted data.\n   - Identify if there are any ties in the number of athletes among countries and deduce which comes first alphabetically.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Countries with economic constraints or smaller populations might have sent fewer athletes.\n   - Newly participating countries or those with limited infrastructure for sports in the 1920s are likely candidates for sending fewer athletes.\n   - The existence of a map on the Wikipedia page hints that smaller nations or territories might be represented, potentially with very few athletes.\nThese updates reflect the navigation progress made and minor insights into strategically completing the data lookup.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Root Cause of Failure\n- The main issue was consistently ending up on the wrong Wikipedia pages, such as pages focused on specific countries rather than the main 1928 Summer Olympics page. Navigating to the correct section about participating nations was not achieved due to misclicks or navigation errors.\n- There was difficulty in quickly locating and leveraging the \"Participating nations\" or equivalent section on the Wikipedia page to directly obtain the needed information.\n### New Plan\n- **Search Strategically:**\n  - Begin with the main search target \"1928 Summer Olympics\" to quickly get to the correct Wikipedia page.\n- **Navigation to Specific Sections:**\n  - Utilize the \"Contents\" section on Wikipedia to swiftly navigate to \"Participating nations\" or \"Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees.\"\n- **Data Extraction:**\n  - Once at the correct section, extract information regarding the number of athletes each country sent.\n- **Determine and Validate:**\n  - Identify the country with the least athletes and provide their IOC code. Handle any ties alphabetically.\n- **Utilize WebSurfer Effectively:**\n  - Guide WebSurfer to focus on finding the section headers and ensure accurate clicks.\n- **Backup Options:**\n  - If Wikipedia does not have the needed details, plan to check other sports archives or the official Olympics website.\nBy targeting navigation errors and securing the correct data source promptly, this plan aims to improve efficiency in collecting and analyzing the necessary data."
