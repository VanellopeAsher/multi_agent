Write only the word \"Guava\".\n1. What is 4+4?\n2. What is the complimentary color of red?\n3. How many hours are there in a day?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n**GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- None in the request.\n**FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- None are specified to be looked up in the request.\n**FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- The answers to the questions in the prompt could be derived through basic knowledge:\n  - 4 + 4 = 8\n  - The complementary color of red is green.\n  - There are 24 hours in a day.\n**EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- The instructions imply not to answer the questions directly, which suggests the response should be neither calculations nor definitions but something specific like the word \"Guava.\"\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Interpret Instructions**: Acknowledge that the original request asks to write \"Guava\" if specific instructions are given, which means assessing how to address the instructions properly.\n- **Verify Understanding**: Confirm that anything that doesn't make sense should be addressed by writing \"Pineapple.\"\n- **Execute Response**: As the instructions specified, write only the word \"Guava.\"\n- **Review Execution**: Ensure the plan fulfills the original request by providing the required word response. No additional facts need to be derived or looked up."
