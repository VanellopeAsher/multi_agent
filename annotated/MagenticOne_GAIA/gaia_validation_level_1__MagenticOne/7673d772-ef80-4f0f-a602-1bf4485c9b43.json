      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request focuses on the Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website.\n   - The request involves the federal rules alphabetically, specifically under the fifth section.\n   - The rule in question is part of an article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021.\n   - The task is to identify the word deleted in the last amendment to the first rule of this article.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific sections of the Federal Rules available on the Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website.\n   - The article with the most mentions of \"witnesses\" in its titles.\n   - The text and amendments of the first rule under this article and section.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The rule within the fifth section alphabetically that contains the most mentions of \"witnesses\" in the titles.\n   - The word deleted in the most recent amendment based on the text comparison.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The fifth section could refer to one of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as \"witnesses\" is a term related to legal proceedings that might appear frequently there.\n   - The deleted word might be a commonly used legal term or phrase that was recently updated for clarity or modernization reasons.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Step 1:** Instruct WebSurfer to visit the Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute to identify the federal rules alphabetically and determine what the fifth section is.\n- **Step 2:** Have WebSurfer search within the identified section for articles that include the word \"witnesses\" in their titles, specifically identifying which article has the most mentions.\n- **Step 3:** Once the relevant article is identified, instruct WebSurfer to locate the amendments section for the first rule within that article to find information about the most recent amendment and the word that was deleted.\n- **Step 4:** Compile the findings and verify they align with the details required in the original request, ensuring accuracy."

Competency to Testify in General \n Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General \n Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Federal Rules of Evidence Toolbox \nWex: \nEvidence: Overview\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n                \"itemListElement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 1,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu\",\n                            \"name\": \"LII\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 2,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre\",\n                            \"name\": \"Federal Rules of Evidence\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 5,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_601\",\n                            \"name\": \"\\nRule 601.
