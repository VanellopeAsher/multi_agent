Enhancements include new features like the `neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` for anomaly detection, and `preprocessing.QuantileTransformer` for robust feature transformation. Cross-validation was also enhanced with the new `model_selection.cross_validate` function, allowing multiple metrics evaluation. There are significant bug fixes across various modules, including corrections in `manifold.TSNE` and improved handling of `model_selection.cross_val_predict` for binary classification.\nThe version primarily focuses on improving performance and usability, including caching transformations in `pipeline.Pipeline` to enhance efficiency during grid searches. Several modeling functions and estimators have been updated or refined, affecting output consistency. Notably, changes in algorithms like `neighbors.NearestCentroid`, `tree` models, and various anomaly detection techniques have been made to fix bugs and optimize performance."

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request pertains to identifying a bug fix in the Scikit-Learn changelog that occurred specifically in July 2017.\n   - We were unable to find an entry specifically labeled as July 2017; the document refers mostly to version 0.19.1 from October 2017.\n   - The changelog during this period involved bug fixes in components such as `model_selection.cross_val_predict`, but no specific mention of July 2017.\n2.

FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Confirmation on whether the absence of a specific July 2017 entry means no updates or that the documentation simply bundles updates under broader releases.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Changelogs may be grouped or delayed, leading to potential misalignment in specific update months versus documentation months.\n   - It’s possible relevant bug fixes for predictor commands were accounted for in subsequently documented versions like 0.19.1 or were missed in release notes.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Issue\nThe root cause of the problem seems to be an incorrect assumption that there was a specific bug fix documented for July 2017. The documentation primarily shows entries for October 2017 and July 2018. There might not have been any July 2017 changes, or they were documented under a different version.\n### New Plan\n- **Clarify the Context:**\n  - Verify any official channels (e.g., GitHub issues or forums) for mentions of specific July 2017 bug fixes. This could clarify whether any fixes were mislabeled or omitted.\n- **Check Version History:**\n  - WebSurfer should review the Scikit-Learn GitHub repository’s commit history around July 2017 to see if there were any significant predictor command bug fixes during that period.\n- **Expand Search Scope:**\n  - If July 2017 mentions remain elusive, check broader contexts surrounding the release, such as related discussions or patch notes that might not have been listed upfront.\n- **Documentation Confirmation:**\n  - Re-confirm with WebSurfer if the Scikit-Learn mailing list or blog posts highlight predictors or estimator fixes around mid-2017.\n- **Final Steps:**\n  - Compile the findings and provide clarity on whether a direct entry exists or if supplemental resources indicate updates occurred at that time. Provide conclusive evidence for or against a July 2017 entry."

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers. Website: https://scikit-learn.org  Installation  Dependencies scikit-learn requires:  Python (>= 3.10) NumPy (>= 1.22.0) SciPy (>= 1.8.0) joblib (>= 1.2.0) threadpoolctl (>= 3.1.0)   Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. scikit-learn 1.0 and later require Python 3.7 or newer. scikit-learn 1.1 and later require Python 3.8 or newer. Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with plot_ and classes end with Display) require Matplotlib (>= 3.5.0). For running the examples Matplotlib >= 3.5.0 is required. A few examples require scikit-image >= 0.19.0, a few examples require pandas >= 1.4.0, some examples require seaborn >= 0.9.0 and plotly >= 5.14.0.  User installation If you already have a working installation of NumPy and SciPy, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using pip: pip install -U scikit-learn  or conda: conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn  The documentation includes more detailed installation instructions.

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog, what other predictor base command received a bug fix? Just give the name, not a path.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The task involves identifying a bug fix in the Scikit-Learn changelog specifically for July 2017.\n   - We haven't found a changelog entry explicitly labeled for July 2017; most available documentation references version 0.19.1 from October 2017.\n   - Bug fixes in the documented timeframe include those in `model_selection.cross_val_predict`.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Determine if bug fixes from July 2017 might have been recorded under a different date in official documents.\n   - Explore if specific July 2017 entries exist outside the main changelog, such as in GitHub commits around that time.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Confirm if the absence of a July 2017-specific entry signifies no releases or if documentation tends to consolidate updates under broader versions.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Changelogs are possibly grouped, affecting the alignment between specific update dates and documented versions.\n   - Relevant bug fixes for predictor commands might be in subsequently documented versions, like 0.19.1, or might have been omitted from release notes.\n   - It's plausible that fixes might have been internally recorded in commit histories without detailed presentation in changelog summaries.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- The exploration of specific commit history around July 2017 was not effectively completed due to navigation challenges and time spent without locating relevant entries or fixes.\n- There was difficulty isolating the specific month of July 2017 in the GitHub commit history, causing delays in finding necessary information.\n### New Plan\n1. **Clarify and Narrow Down Timeline:**\n   - WebSurfer should select the appropriate year and month using the GitHub commit history date picker without unnecessary clickbacks, ensuring efficient navigation to July 2017.\n2. **Focus on Commits Related to Predictors:**\n   - Clearly search for keywords like \"predictor\" or \"bug fix\" within the commit messages for July 2017.\n   - Review each commit if necessary to identify any related to predictor base commands.\n3. **Expand Search to Other Channels:**\n   - Investigate other resources like Scikit-Learn's GitHub issues or discussions for any mentions of bug fixes around mid-2017.\n   - Cross-reference any found information with release notes to ensure it corresponds accurately with the July timeline.\n4. **Cross-Verify with Documentation:**\n   - Double-check the official Scikit-Learn changelogs or relevant documentation for any possible overlooked entries.\n   - Use key phrases to efficiently search within documents.\n5. **Synthesize Findings:**\n   - Compile identified bug fixes related to predictors and confirm their association with July 2017, documenting specifics along the way.\nThis revised plan aims for precise navigation and utilization of resources, ensuring relevant fixes are identified and aligned with the correct timeframe."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog, what other predictor base command received a bug fix? Just give the name, not a path.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet with new insights:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The task involves identifying a bug fix in the Scikit-Learn changelog specifically for July 2017.\n   - We haven't found a changelog entry explicitly labeled for July 2017; most available documentation references version 0.19.1 from October 2017, where bug fixes are documented.\n   - Bug fixes in the documented timeframe include those in `model_selection.cross_val_predict`.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Determine if bug fixes from July 2017 might have been recorded under a different date in official documents.\n   - Investigate specific July 2017 entries in GitHub commits and issues for potential bug fixes not listed in major changelog updates.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Confirm if the absence of a July 2017-specific entry signifies no releases or if documentation tends to consolidate updates under broader versions like 0.19.1.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Changelogs tend to group updates, so specific fixes from July 2017 may appear in releases from later months.\n   - It is possible that bug fixes related to predictor commands are recorded in commit histories or detailed GitHub issues rather than main changelog summaries.\n   - The Scikit-Learn team might have internal records of fixes that were addressed outside of official release notes, especially if the fix was minor.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- The navigation to the correct GitHub page was unsuccessful, leading to difficulty in accessing the commit history directly.\n- The repeated attempt to reach the repository resulted in returning to search page links and not the necessary GitHub repository.\n- The current plan has lacked effectiveness in addressing and adapting to the click or access paths needed to reach detailed commit history from the repository page.\n### New Plan\n1. **Direct Navigation:**\n   - WebSurfer should repeat the action, explicitly ensuring they reach the Scikit-Learn GitHub page directly by re-entering the GitHub-specific URL.\n   - Avoid links that redirect back to search results; make sure navigation stays within GitHub once accessed.\n2. **Targeted Search:**\n   - Within the GitHub repository, navigate to the \"Commits\" section and use the search/filter function to identify changes related to \"predictor\" or \"bug fix\" around July 2017.\n3. **Explore Alternative Resources:**\n   - Beyond commit messages, also consider checking GitHub Issues or Pull Requests labeled around July 2017, as they might contain detailed discussions about bug fixes that weren’t given prominent mention in the changelog.\n4. **Documentation Review:**\n   - If direct commit data is elusive, re-check the version 0.19.1 changelog for any related fixes that might have been consolidated post-July 2017.\n5. **Synthesize and Verify:**\n   - Cross-reference any discovered entries with official release notes and related technical documentation to ensure accuracy regarding the timeline and relevance to predictors.\nThis revised plan emphasizes correct navigation, strategic searching within GitHub, and a broader verification approach to ascertain fixes potentially relevant to July 2017."
