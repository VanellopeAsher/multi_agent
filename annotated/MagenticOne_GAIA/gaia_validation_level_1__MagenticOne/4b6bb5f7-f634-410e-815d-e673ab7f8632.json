      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who, the Doctor is trapped inside an ever-shifting maze. What is this location called in the official script for the episode? Give the setting exactly as it appears in the first scene heading.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.\n- The Doctor is trapped inside an ever-shifting maze.\n- The request is asking for the exact name of the location as per the official script.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The official script or transcript of Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who to find the setting specified in the first scene heading. This can typically be found in script archives, official Doctor Who websites, or databases that store television show scripts.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- None. The request primarily requires direct information from a primary source (the official script).\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The episode in question is \"Heaven Sent,\" which is likely relevant since it features the Doctor in a trapped setting. \n- The location might be a unique or thematic name related to the episode's plot.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer Task**: Search for the official script or a reliable transcript of Series 9, Episode 11 (\"Heaven Sent\") of Doctor Who online. Focus specifically on finding the first scene heading in the script to determine the location.\n- **WebSurfer Task**: Look for reputable websites that may host these scripts, such as official Doctor Who websites, script archives, or trusted databases.\n- **Assistant's Role**: Assist in analyzing results and compiling findings into accurate information to address the original request.\n- **FileSurfer Task**: In case the script is found and downloaded, verify the document and locate the necessary information regarding the first scene heading. However, this step may be redundant if the information is found directly online."

Colonnades, and chambers, and\nfountains, and libraries ... All in dusty ancient stone.\nMoving closer over details: in every room, mounted somewhere\non the wall is a Cog Unit - a mechanical fixture that looks\nlike it could move the whole wall.\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(V.O.)\nWherever you go, whatever path you\ntake, it will follow; never faster,\nnever slower, always coming.\nNow, tracking along a floor. Sprinkles of blood, streaks of\nit, like someone, terribly injured has been hauling\nthemselves along.\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(V.O.)\nYou will run - it will walk. You\nwill rest - it will not.\nNow travelling along those corridors, picking out details.\nEvery now and then, incongruously, there is a television\nmonitor wired into the wall. Each of these is currently\nsnowed with interference.\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(V.O.)\nOne day you will linger in the same\nplace too long.\n(MORE)\n(CONTINUED)\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             1\nDW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\n1\nCONTINUED:\n1\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\nYou will sit too still or sleep too\ndeep - and when, too late, you rise\nto go, you will notice a second\nshadow next to yours.

TELEPORT CHAMBER/CASTLE - DAY\n2\nA circular chamber of ancient, but active, technology. Brass\nand glass. Intricate mechanisms, spinning and ticking and\nglittering everywhere. Again, dotted around the walls and\nequipment, cogs, this time in gleaming brass.\nCloser on:\nThe ceiling spirals down in towards the centre of the room,\nlike a funnel. Beneath the base of the funnel, a circular\nglass cabinet, just big enough for a man to stand in. It\nlooks like what it is: a teleporter.\nOn the teleporter controls.\nThe hunched shadow falls over it -\n- a trembling, bloodied hand reaches for a lever -\nThe room shakes, shudders!\nOn the wall - the brass cogs start glowing.\nThe bloodied hand slams the lever and the hunched figure\nfalls, crashing to the floor.\nIn the glass cabinet, a glow is starting up - exactly like\nthe glow we saw as the Doctor dematerialised at the end of\nTrap Street.\nOn the walls - the cogs turning.\nThe floor - the bloodied hand, shaking with effort, is\nwriting letters in the dust.\nB\nNow cutting round various walls of the castle -\n- the cogs turning and turning -\n- faster and faster -\nBack to the bloodied hand, writing in the dust -\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             2\n(CONTINUED)\nDW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\n2\nCONTINUED:\n2\nBIR\nThe glow in the cabinet, stronger and stronger. Starting to\ntake familiar shape -\nThe cogs - faster and faster.\nOn the bloodied hand still writing - we see curves and lines\nbut not the finished word.\nThe hand starts to glow. Spasms in pain - steaming now. In a\nmoment the hand crumbles to the barest outline of ash.\nOn the brass cogs. They all slam to a halt.\nCutting to the stone cogs on all the walls - also slamming to\na halt.\nNow on the glass cabinet at the centre of the chamber.\nThe golden glow is resolving, refining -\n- now clearly, this is the Doctor.\nHe is frozen for a moment -\n- then convulses into life. Choking, spluttering. Slams\nagainst the glass of the cabinet, starts to register where he\nis.\nA moment to recover.\nNow he’s opening the door of the cabinet, stepping into the\ngleaming brass and glass room. Looking around.\nA haunted look crosses his face. A memory impacting,\nsickeningly.\nFLASHBACK: Clara’s death from Trap Street.\nThe Doctor: she’s dead, she’s gone. Nothing he can do.\nSo. To business.\nHe glances round. A studied show of indifference to his\nsurroundings.\nStraightens his coat. Composes himself. If anyone is\nobserving, he’s telling them he means business and he is not\nafraid.\nFinally, he speaks.\nTHE DOCTOR\nIf you think, because she’s dead, I\nam weak, you understand very\nlittle.
