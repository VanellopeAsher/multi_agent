Last) that worked on the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" in 2015, what was the title of the first paper authored by the one that had authored prior papers?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The paper is titled \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\"\n   - The paper was published in 2015.\n   - Authors of the paper are listed in the format: First M.

This information might be found through academic databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, or the publication records of relevant conferences or journals.\n   - The publication histories of these authors to identify if any had authored prior papers. This can be looked up in the same academic databases or possibly in public research profiles (e.g., ResearchGate, ORCID).\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - By looking up and comparing authors’ publication histories, determine which author had authored prior papers and identify their first paper.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It is reasonable to hypothesize that at least one author has a publication history if they contributed to a research paper in 2015; thus, it might not be unusual to find prior papers from them.\n   - Given the format of author names as \"First M. Last,\" it's possible there could be ambiguity with common names, which may require more investigation to ensure accuracy (e.g., distinguishing between authors with similar names).\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Use the WebSurfer to search for the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" to identify the authors and obtain their full names.\n- Once the author names are identified, use the WebSurfer to look up the publication histories of each author to determine if any of them had authored prior papers.\n- Identify the author, if any, who has prior publications, and determine their first paper's title.\n- Summarize the findings to answer the original request."

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The paper is titled \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\"\n   - The paper was published in 2015.\n   - Authors of the paper are listed in the format: First M.

This information might be found through academic databases such as Google Scholar or IEEE Xplore.\n   - The publication histories of these authors to identify if any had authored prior papers.

FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - By looking up and comparing authors’ publication histories, determine which author had authored prior papers and identify their first paper.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It is reasonable to hypothesize that at least one author has a publication history if they contributed to a research paper in 2015; thus, it might not be unusual to find prior papers from them.\n   - The lack of results on Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore using typical search queries may indicate that alternative search methods or databases are required (e.g., using direct access to the sites, or reaching out to universities or conferences that might have hosted the publication).\n   - Given the format of author names as \"First M. Last,\" and potential commonality or ambiguity, additional verification might be needed to ensure accurate identification of authors in large databases.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- **Search Challenges**: Initial search attempts did not yield the specific information needed about authors because the queries might not have been accurate enough or were executed on databases that did not contain the required paper.\n- **Limited Visibility**: Search engines provided limited information, which led to repetitive attempts without new results or directions.\n- **Execution Flaw**: Relying solely on surface-level database access (via search engines) without direct searches within specific academic platforms (e.g., direct in IEEE Xplore or Google Scholar) may have hindered deeper exploration.\n### New Plan\n- **Direct Database Access**: Access academic databases directly (e.g., IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, ResearchGate) rather than relying solely on search engine queries. This can be done by going to the databases' main pages and searching there.\n- **Focused Search Terms**: Use specific, relevant search terms directly within academic platforms, such as the exact paper title in quotes. Additionally, include the year \"2015\" to filter search results.\n- **Explore Multiple Databases**: If IEEE Xplore or Google Scholar doesn’t yield results, try accessing other academic resources like ResearchGate, university library portals, or conference proceedings databases.\n- **Sequential Approach**: Once authors are identified, sequentially look up each author’s publication history in a similarly direct manner on platforms like Google Scholar or ResearchGate to find prior works.\n- **Verify and Cross-Check**: Cross-check author details to ensure accuracy, especially for common names. Look for specific identifiers if available, such as institutional affiliations or unique author IDs (e.g., ORCID).\n- **Documentation**: Document any new findings at each step to avoid redundancy and keep track of verified facts for further action."

Last) that worked on the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" in 2015, what was the title of the first paper authored by the one that had authored prior papers?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The paper is titled \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\"\n   - The paper was published in 2015.\n   - Authors of the paper are listed in the format: First M. Last.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The exact names of the authors who worked on the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" in 2015. This information might be found through academic databases such as IEEE Xplore or Google Scholar.\n   - The publication histories of these authors to identify if any had authored prior papers.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - By looking up and comparing authors’ publication histories, determine which author had authored prior papers and identify their first paper.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It is reasonable to hypothesize that at least one author has a publication history if they contributed to a research paper in 2015; thus, it might not be unusual to find prior papers from them.\n   - The lack of specific search results indicates there might be a need to explore multiple academic databases directly, as indirect search methods like web browsers may not provide comprehensive results.\n   - Given the common structure of names and potential ambiguity, extra verification might be crucial when identifying authors with similar names. Using author identifiers like ORCID, if available, could be advantageous.\n   - The listing formats on sites like IEEE Xplore might require more granular search input, such as exploring individual authors in depth after identifying them.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- **Browser Search Limitation**: Using a general browser search for academic content proved ineffective as it didn't yield specific results from IEEE or similar databases.\n- **Lack of Database Navigation**: We did not access the IEEE Xplore or Google Scholar directly to perform focused searches, resulting in a generic and unhelpful outcome.\n### New Plan\n- **Direct Database Access**: Use WebSurfer to directly access IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar. Perform a search for the paper using exact title and year.\n- **Specific Search Queries**: Utilize specific search queries on these platforms, including the paper title in quotes and the publication year, to locate detailed results.\n- **Look for Author Information**: Once the paper is found, gather details on the authors and switch focus to examining their publication histories using their profiles on the same platforms.\n- **Use Author IDs**: If available, collect ORCID or similar identifiers to ensure accurate tracking of authors' publication histories.\n- **Sequential Approach**: For each author identified, systematically track their prior publications, focusing on identifying who had prior publications and their earliest work.\n- **Document Findings**: Carefully document findings at all stages to avoid redundancy and ensure every relevant piece of information is captured for later steps."

This paper specifically compares pie menus with li near menus. Although other researchers have investigated similar themes it is felt that there is still not enough knowle dge regarding the various effects of different menu types, including their positioning on a screen. An empirical approach using an experiment to test the effectiveness and user satisfaction of a pie menu and a linear menu is described in de tail. Four tasks were administered to experimental participants under each menu design in a within users experimen tal design. Overall task time, number of errors and participants' subjective opinions were measured. The data were statistically analysed. There were no statistically significant results for task times and errors. However, subjective opinions were overall statistically significant, suggesting a preferenc e for the pie menu by participants. These results are interesting for all web designers, user interface designers and developers. The issues being investigated are rather complex, b ecause there is no clear pattern of results to suggest a categorical ‘best design’. These results add to the current kno wledge in existence regarding menu types and to the wish of understanding better the issues involved with menu types.\noda.oslomet.no\nMostra altroSalva \nCita \nCitato da 9 \nArticoli correlati \nTutte e 6 le versioni \nVisualizzazione del risultato migliore di questa ricerca. \nMostra tutti i risultatiPrivacy\nTermini\nGuida\nInformazioni su Scholar\nGuida della Ricerca\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=2\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
