In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. In Figure 1.13, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. The red dots in dish B represent Penicillium colonies. Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria grown in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth, he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died.\nWhich of the following statements is a reasonable expression of Fleming’s hypothesis? \nNutrient broth kills bacteria.\nThere are clear areas around the Penicillium mold where Staphylococcus doesn't grow.\nMold kills bacteria.\nPenicillium mold produces a substance that kills Staphylococcus.\nWithout mold in the culture dish, there were no clear areas in the bacteria.\nFleming grew Penicillium in broth, then removed the Penicillium and poured the broth into culture dishes containing bacteria to see if the broth would kill the bacteria.

It then sucks some blood and removes its beak. If the mosquito carries disease-causing microorganisms, it injects these into its host along with the anti-coagulant. It was assumed for a long time that the virus typhus was injected by the louse when sucking blood in a manner similar to the mosquito. But apparently this is not so. The infection is not in the saliva of the louse, but in the feces. The disease is thought to be spread when the louse feces come in contact with scratches or bite wounds in the host's skin. A test of this was carried out in 1922 when two workers fed infected lice on a monkey, taking great care that no louse feces came into contact with the monkey. After two weeks, the monkey had NOT become ill with typhus. The workers then injected the monkey with typhus and it became ill within a few days. Why did the workers inject the monkey with typhus near the end of the experiment?\nto prove that the lice carried the typhus virus\nto prove the monkey was similar to man\nto prove that the monkey was not immune to typhus\nto prove that mosquitoes were not carriers of typhus\nthe workers were mean\nEijkman fed a group of chickens exclusively on rice whose seed coat had been removed (polished rice or white rice). The chickens all developed polyneuritis (a disease of chickens) and died. He fed another group of chickens unpolished rice (rice that still had its seed coat). Not a single one of them contracted polyneuritis. He then gathered the polishings from rice (the seed coats that had been removed) and fed the polishings to other chickens that were sick with polyneuritis. In a short time, the birds all recovered. Eijkman had accurately traced the cause of polyneuritis to a faulty diet. For the first time in history, a food deficiency disease had been produced and cured experimentally. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Eijkman’s hypothesis?\nPolyneuritis is a fatal disease for chickens.\nWhite rice carries a virus for the disease polyneuritis.\nUnpolished rice does not carry the polyneuritis virus.\nThe rice seed coat contains a nutrient that provides protection for chickens against polyneuritis.\nNone of these is a reasonable statement of Eijkman's hypothesis.\nThe three questions below relate to the following paragraphs.\nScientist A noticed that in a certain forest area, the only animals inhabiting the region were giraffes. He also noticed that the only food available for the animals was on fairly tall trees and as the summer progressed, the animals ate the leaves high and higher on the trees. The scientist suggested that these animals were originally like all other animals but generations of animals stretching their necks to reach higher up the trees for food, caused the species to grow very long necks.\nScientist B conducted experiments and observed that stretching muscles does NOT cause bones to grow longer nor change the \nDNA of animals so that longer muscles would be passed on to the next generation. Scientist B, therefore, discarded Scientist A's suggested answer as to why all the animals living in the area had long necks. Scientist B suggested instead that originally many different types of animals including giraffes had lived in the region but only the giraffes could survive when the only food was high in the trees, and so all the other species had left the area.\n?\ncontents\nreadability\nresources\ntools\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about a surname of an equine veterinarian mentioned in 1.E Exercises.\n- The chemistry materials are licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license.\n- The materials are found in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry, compiled on 08/21/2023.\n- We have identified the online location of the 1.E Exercises on LibreTexts, but the equine veterinarian has not been found through manual browsing of the exercises section.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific mention of an equine veterinarian in the 1.E Exercises.\n- Any downloadable versions of the chemistry materials, which might make it easier to search the content offline.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The context in which the equine veterinarian is mentioned, which could provide clues about the relevance to chemistry.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The equine veterinarian might be part of an example or case study related to the application of chemistry in veterinary medicine. This could provide context for where to look within the exercises.\n- There might be a specific section or question directly mentioning veterinary applications, which can be likely candidates for holding this information.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of What Went Wrong\n- **Root Cause:** The equine veterinarian's mention was not located due to the inability to efficiently search the entire content of the '1.E Exercises' section online, as manual scrolling and viewing were not fruitful.\n- Additionally, there was no offline access to the document where a direct and comprehensive search could be conducted.\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - **Locate and Access Downloadable Content:** Search for a downloadable PDF or document version of the LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials licensed under CK-12. This makes it easier to search content directly.\n  - **Focused Web Search:** Use specific search terms like “equine veterinarian” combined with “1.E Exercises” to locate if there are direct references or summaries elsewhere online.\n- **FileSurfer:**\n  - **Assist with Local Searches:** Once WebSurfer locates downloadable content, FileSurfer should be used to search the document efficiently for mentions of “equine veterinarian” or related terms.\n- **Assistant:**\n  - **Coordinate Efforts:** Ensure WebSurfer and FileSurfer tasks are synchronized so that once a document is downloaded, FileSurfer can quickly proceed with a detailed search.\n  - **Utilize Advanced Search Techniques:** If content is accessible online, suggest tools or browser extensions to assist WebSurfer in performing text searches on large web pages.\n- **General Approach:**\n  - **Avoid Scrolling-based Searches:** Directly downloaded or searchable text formats should be prioritized to avoid inefficiencies in manual scrolling.\n  - **Use Context Clues:** Focus on sections of the document discussing veterinary practices or chemistry applications in biology."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nWhat is the surname of the equine veterinarian mentioned in 1.E Exercises from the chemistry materials licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials as compiled 08/21/2023?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request focuses on finding the surname of an equine veterinarian mentioned in the 1.E Exercises section.\n   - Chemistry materials are authored by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew and are licensed under CK-12.\n   - These materials are part of LibreText's Introductory Chemistry, compiled on 08/21/2023.\n   - Direct access through search engines and the LibreTexts website has been challenging.\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific mention and context of the equine veterinarian in the 1.E Exercises.\n   - An available downloadable version of the materials, ideally as a PDF.\n   - Any possible archive or alternate access locations for this textbook.\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The context in which the equine veterinarian is mentioned, possibly indicating the connection with chemistry applications in veterinary science.\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is plausible that the equine veterinarian's mention relates to a practical chemistry application like pharmacology, focusing on drug formulation or diagnostics in animals.\n   - Considering the comprehensive layout of educational materials, the veterinarian might be featured in examples highlighting real-world chemistry applications.\n   - Checking sections related to biochemistry might yield connections due to the natural overlap between chemistry and veterinary studies.\n### Reasoning\n- **Download Access:** Searching for downloadable copies can simplify finding specific text references.\n- **Practical Applications:** Using real-world applications in exercises is common, justifying the probable mention of a veterinary professional.\n- **Biochemistry Connection:** The intersection of veterinary science and chemistry often involves pharmacology, so related sections should be scrutinized.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of What Went Wrong\n- **Root Cause:** Navigation through browser searches was repetitive and ineffective in locating specific content.\n- **Webpage Navigation Issues:** Pop-ups and page interactions hampered efficient browsing.\n- **Lack of Specificity:** Searches did not lead to downloadable content or direct access to the necessary exercises.\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - **Use Focused Keywords:** Directly search for \"1.E Chemistry LibreTexts PDF download\" to target downloadable versions.\n  - **Explore Archive Sites:** Check Wayback Machine or Archive.org explicitly for archived documents related to the chemistry text.\n  - **Be Strategic with Pop-Ups:** Efficiently manage pop-ups—accepting or dismissing to avoid repeated interruptions.\n- **FileSurfer:**\n  - **Search Capabilities:** If a downloadable document is obtained, use FileSurfer to perform targeted keyword searches for \"equine veterinarian.\"\n- **Assistant:**\n  - **Refined Search Guidance:** Provide clear, outcome-oriented search queries and logic to WebSurfer for improved results.\n- **General Approach:**\n  - **Concentrate on New Sources:** Shift away from previously explored links and seek untapped resources.\n  - **Verify Results Early:** Quickly check newly loaded pages for relevance to avoid wasted exploration.\n  - **Avoid Repetition:** Focus efforts on novel approaches and maintain a log of accessed resources to prevent redundancy. \nThis approach aims to maximize efficiency in locating the relevant exercise content by leveraging strategic searches and better resource management."
