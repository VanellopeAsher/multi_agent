      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nOn the BBC Earth YouTube video of the Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments, what species of bird is featured?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request specifically mentions a \"BBC Earth YouTube video\" titled \"Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments.\"\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific species of bird featured in the mentioned YouTube video.\n   - The content of the video can be found on the BBC Earth YouTube channel.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None in this case, as the request centers around direct information from a video.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Potentially common or humorous birds that could fit the theme of \"silliest moments,\" such as parrots, penguins, or ostriches, though specific knowledge of the video is required for accuracy.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Assign WebSurfer to perform a web search for the BBC Earth YouTube video titled \"Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments.\"\n- Ask WebSurfer to open and view the video to identify the species of bird featured.\n- Have WebSurfer summarize the relevant part of the video or provide any additional context needed to confirm the species of bird."
