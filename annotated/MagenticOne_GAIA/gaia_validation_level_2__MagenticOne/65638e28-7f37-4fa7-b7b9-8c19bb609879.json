      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nThe book with the doi 10.1353/book.24372 concerns a certain neurologist. According to chapter 2 of the book, what author influenced this neurologist’s belief in “endopsychic myths”? Give the last name only.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request concerns a book identified by the DOI 10.1353/book.24372.\n- The book is about a certain neurologist.\n- Chapter 2 of the book discusses an author who influenced this neurologist’s belief in “endopsychic myths.”\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The identity of the neurologist discussed in the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372.\n- Information from Chapter 2 of the book, specifically the author who influenced the neurologist’s belief in “endopsychic myths.”\n- It may be necessary to access the book via a platform that handles DOIs, such as a library database or a publisher's website.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Based on the context provided, determining the era or general field of the neurologist could help in understanding the historical and intellectual context.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on the terminology “endopsychic myths,” the neurologist could potentially be a historical figure in psychology or psychoanalysis, possibly related to theories around the unconscious or subconscious mind. This could suggest figures associated with early psychological theories.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Have the WebSurfer search for the book using the DOI 10.1353/book.24372 to identify the book's title and author, and to confirm if an online version or summary is available.\n- If the full text or a preview of the book is found, direct WebSurfer to navigate to Chapter 2 to identify the author who influenced the neurologist's belief in \"endopsychic myths.\"\n- If necessary, use WebSurfer to search for summaries or analyses of the book that might mention Chapter 2 or the relevant author.\n- Once the author influencing the neurologist is identified, provide the last name of that author as the final answer."

It affected him deeply, and he wrote to Fliess of an uprooted feeling.1 The death of his father led to a certain degree of self-analysis. Only a few weeks after abandoning his belief in neurotics in September 1897, he announced that he had begun a self-analysis.2 This was to be the method by which he sought to clarify his intellectual thoughts. Later, Freud wrote in the foreword to the second edition of The Interpretation of Dreams (1908) that he had only recently realized that the book was at least partly the product of his reaction to the death of his father.3According to the seduction theory, fathers were all possible incest committers. Given that neuroses were quite common, the natural conclusion is that there must indeed be a great many defective fathers. Even Freud’s own father could not remain completely beyond suspicion. Then, however, he recognized the failings of the seduction theory and developed an interest in child sexuality. No longer were the parental (incestuous) desires central, but those of the children. In the spring of 1897 he sent Fliess draft N, in which he made clear that he saw the hostile impulses toward parents as an integral part of neurosis.4 He now thought that sons harboured a death wish against their fathers and daughters against their mothers. These impulses were generally repressed, owing to compassion for ill or dying parents, for example. For that matter he also noted that the seeds of his own self-reproaches lay in his childhood jealousy of his infant brother Julius, who only lived for a few months.5This theme of son versus father quickly manifests itself again in a letter to Fliess. That autumn Freud noted that his self-analysis had confirmed, inter alia, that sons desire their mothers and are jealous of their fathers.6 For Freud this is not a pathological phenomenon but part of early childhood. It was in this connection that he first mentioned Oedipus, the main character in Sophocles’ tragedy.1  S. Freud, The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess, p.202.2  Idem, p.268. Whatever we may call it, Freud in the late 1890s subjected himself to a thorough self-scrutiny, an elaborate, penetrating, and unceasing census of his fragmentary memories, his concealed wishes and emotions. P. Gay, Freud, p.97. This self-analysis was not something completely new in his life. As early as the 1880s Freud kept a dream diary, and his letters to Martha Bernays also reveal some self-analysis. E. Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, Vol. I, pp.351-352.3  S. Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, SE IV, p.xxvi.4  S. Freud, The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess, p.250.5  Idem, p.268.6  Idem, p.272.\nA Dark Trace38Research into the origins of morality and unpleasure led Freud away from neurotic patients: he no longer trusted their stories. That is to say, he no longer knew whether they were fantasies or might now and again be actual childhood experiences. He found self-analysis more trustworthy, despite it being more complex and painful personally. His self-analysis largely analysed dreams7 and associations. For confirmation of his findings he turned to a mixture of clinical experiences, literary sources and philosophical ideas.His self-analysis also meant abandoning the “pathological versus normal” scheme. Neurotics form recurring memories from pathological complaints and symptoms. When he began his self-analysis he was also concerned with the recurrence of memories, but now their analysis served to expose general human psychic structures.2.2 Your guilt isn’t the same as mineFreud himself knew exactly when self-analysis had produced its first major results – in a dream he had on 24 July 1895.8 Freud was receiving guests, including a certain Irma, in a large hall. He took her aside in order to answer a letter she had sent him. He reproached her for not having accepted his “solution” and said to her, “If you still get pains, it’s really only your fault”. Irma then made it clear that she was still in a lot of pain and Freud subsequently examined her. He discovered spots in her mouth and called upon one of the other guests for assistance. This Dr M. confirmed an infection, one which Freud knew he had not caused but which he suspected of having been caused by an injection with an improperly sterilized needle by a friend, Otto.Freud’s own analysis of this dream is extensively reported in The Interpretation of Dreams.9 The core of the dream is clear: (self-)reproaches and wishes. His ultimate conclusion"

Other interests only appear sporadically in the correspondence. Freud’s enthusiasm for a book by Rudolf Kleinpaul (1845-1918) entitled Die Lebendigen und die Toten in Volksglauben, Religion und Sage [The Living and the Dead in Folk Belief, Religion and Legend], 1898, is thus striking. After studying this book he discovered the existence of “endopsychic myths”.33 By this is meant that all kinds of ideas, such as those which appear in the various myths and sagas of various peoples and periods, stem from the same desires. Concepts regarding immortality, revenge and the hereafter should thus originally stem from unconscious ideas. In other words, all kinds of “thought-illusions” are “projected” outwards in the future or hereafter.This book by Kleinpaul is principally about folk belief, religion and legends of the dead and death.34 His point of departure is unambiguous: the belief in spirits or souls which one finds in many forms of belief can generally be traced back to “images of the survivors”. Spirits are thus not beings from the other side, but images of the deceased which “live on in memory, which occupy the fantasy and 29  S. Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, SE V, pp.611-613; G. Gödde, Traditionslinien des “Unbe-wußten”, pp.182ff.30  Idem, p.185.31  S. Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, SE V, p.620.32  P. Gay, Freud, p.129.33  S. Freud, The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess, p.286.34  R. Kleinpaul, Die Lebendigen und die Toten in Volksglauben, Religion und Sage, Göschen’sche Verlagshandlung, Leipzig, 1898.\nA Dark Trace44appear to those left behind in dreams and in the imagination”.35 These thoughts do not mean that many folk beliefs must be dispensed with as foolishness. “In a certain sense the people are right to believe in spirits, indeed they must”.36 What Kleinpaul is interested in is not the equation of an illusion with nonsense and falseness. His concerns lie elsewhere. He is interested in the phenomenon that deceased loved ones return as malignant beings. Thus the living focus on doing everything possible to create distance between themselves and the dead (burying the body, the belief in the hereafter in heaven, the island of the dead separated from the world of the living by a river). In the end the reason is a desire to keep the dead far away, for they are malevolent. If they return they do so as an apparition or demon. In order to lend support to his thesis, Kleinpaul drew on a selection of sources, in part the same as those Freud used: Greek myths, Shakespeare, Goethe.A central idea is that “the dead kill”37 for “the dead draw the living to them”.38 Kleinpaul puts this idea forward based on the experiential fact that couples in love often die quickly after one another. By way of example he cites the devil which comes for Faust and Brutus who is visited by the ghost of Julius Caesar just before his own death.39 Freud’s interest in Kleinpaul’s book comes at a noteworthy moment, namely in the period of his self-analysis and the working through of the death of his father. At that time, as evidenced in The Interpretation of Dreams, he regularly identified himself with Goethe’s Faust (or Mephistopheles) and also with Brutus.40Freud saw the idea that the dead can kill as the culmination of Kleinpaul’s book. He said as much in Totem and Taboo which, after his initial enthusiasm to Fliess, is the first time he discussed the work again.41 Freud endorsed this idea, subsequently linked it to compulsive (self-)reproach and from there to the origins of morality and religion. We shall return in a later chapter to Totem and Taboo, but it is worthwhile examining this passage further. Indeed, we see here how the self-analysis, in combination with his interest in Kleinpaul’s work, was fundamentally reworked in this later publication. He adopted Kleinpaul’s idea and linked it with clinical experiences. “When a wife has lost her husband or a daughter her mother, it not unfrequently happens that the survivor is overwhelmed 35  Idem, foreword iii.36  Idem, iv.37  Die Toten töten; jeder Tote streckt gleichsam eine Hand zum Grabe heraus, die er den Lebenden reicht und mit der er sie zu sich ins Grab hinunterzieht.
