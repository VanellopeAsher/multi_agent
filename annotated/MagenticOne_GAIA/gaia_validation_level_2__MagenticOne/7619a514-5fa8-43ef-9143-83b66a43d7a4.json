      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves finding information related to the \"Regression\" label in a closed numpy.polynomial issue on GitHub.\n   - The format for the date should be in MM/DD/YY.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue in the numpy.polynomial repository on GitHub.\n   - This information can be found on the GitHub issues page for numpy, specifically by filtering issues that have the \"Regression\" label and that are closed.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which of the closed issues is the oldest based on their timelines.\n   - Identify when the label \"Regression\" was applied to that specific issue, if available.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - GitHub may have the capability to filter issues by label and status, which allows for efficiently finding the required information.\n   - The labeling event might be documented in the issue's timeline or history on GitHub.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Have WebSurfer access the GitHub page for the numpy repository to locate the \"Issues\" section.\n- In the \"Issues\" section, instruct WebSurfer to filter issues by the \"Regression\" label and closed status to locate the relevant issues.\n- Have WebSurfer identify the oldest issue from the filtered list and examine its timeline or history to determine when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- Retrieve and present the date in the MM/DD/YY format as requested."

The polynomial coefficients are given in decreasing order of powers. For example, to evaluate a polynomial at x, use polynomial.polyval(p, x), where p is the polynomial coefficients.How to Evaluate Polynomial at X and Shape of the ... - GeeksforGeeksgeeksforgeeks.org\nWhat is a polynomial in NumPy?\nThe various routines in numpy.polynomial all deal with series whose coefficients go from degree zero upward, which is the reverse order of the poly1d convention. The easy way to remember this is that indices correspond to degree, i.e., coef[i] is the coefficient of the term of degree i.Polynomials — NumPy v2.2.dev0 Manualnumpy.org\nWhat is polynomial regression in Python?\nPolynomial regression in Python refers to creating a bivariate polynomial regression model in Python. The aim is to create a 3D visualization of the observations and the polynomial model in Python, with the observations represented by blue dots and the predictions by a multicolored 3D surface.Polynomial Regression in Python - Sem Spiritsemspirit.com\nHow to perform a regression in NumPy?\nThere are a number of different ways to carry out a regression in Numpy, but here we’ll use matrix algebra to generate theta specifically for a line. Using a built-in function like numpy.polyfit() is also a great way to do the same thing. After creating these three matrices, we generate theta by taking the following dot products:Linear regression with Numpy.

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves finding information related to the \"Regression\" label in a closed numpy.polynomial issue on GitHub.\n   - The format for the date should be in MM/DD/YY.\n   - Search results have revealed specific issues linked to regression problems in numpy.polynomial.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue in the numpy.polynomial section on GitHub.\n   - This information can be found on the GitHub issues page or through search results related to numpy.polynomial.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which of the regression-labeled closed issues is the oldest by examining their history or timeline.\n   - Identify when the label \"Regression\" was applied to that specific issue using issue details.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - GitHub's search and filter functions can be used flexibly to narrow down issues by specific labels and statuses, including numpy.polynomial related topics.\n   - The labeling information should typically be present in the issue's timeline, specifically under activity or event logs.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of What Went Wrong\nThe main issue was the difficulty in efficiently navigating and filtering through GitHub issues to find the specific \"Regression\" label within the numpy.polynomial context. The approach taken was too broad and focused on general issue searches rather than specifically targeting the required information, leading to a lack of progress.\n### New Plan\n- **Target the Specific Repository Context:**\n  - Ensure that the search is narrowed down to the `numpy/numpy` repository on GitHub.\n- **Refine the Search:**\n  - Use GitHub's filtering options to directly access issues with the \"Regression\" label and related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Utilize the Issue Timeline:**\n  - Once the oldest issue with the \"Regression\" label is found, examine the timeline or activity log of the issue to identify when the label was added.\n- **Steps to Follow:**\n  1. WebSurfer will navigate to the `numpy/numpy` GitHub repository and access the Issues section.\n  2. Apply filters for the \"Regression\" label and closed issues.\n  3. Narrow it down to issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n  4. Locate and open the oldest closed issue from the search results.\n  5. Check the issue timeline for label addition details.\n- **Address Potential Issues:**\n  - If filtering by specific labels is complex, manually searching for keywords related to `numpy.polynomial` can help.\n  - Ensure to capture all relevant dates and details from the timeline to accurately identify the label addition event."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves finding information related to the \"Regression\" label in a closed numpy.polynomial issue on GitHub.\n   - The date format should be in MM/DD/YY.\n   - Specific issues linked to regression problems in numpy.polynomial have been difficult to pinpoint directly using GitHub's filters.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue related to numpy.polynomial on GitHub.\n   - This date might not be directly visible and could require a combination of searching different terms or conditions.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which closed issues are related to both \"Regression\" and \"numpy.polynomial.\"\n   - Use GitHub issue timelines to see when the \"Regression\" label was added to each relevant issue.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Using search engines in addition to GitHub's own search might reveal more precise results or lead to specific issue numbers or discussions.\n   - Given the complex nature of GitHub filters, a direct approach using external search terms might be more effective than relying entirely on GitHub's internal filtering capabilities.\n   - There might be issues where \"polynomial\" is mentioned in the context or comments instead of being directly labeled under \"numpy.polynomial.\"\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of What Went Wrong\n- **Inefficient Search Strategy:** There was an overreliance on GitHub's internal filters, which proved inadequate for finding specific intersections of multiple labels and components.\n- **Narrow Focus on Filters:** The attempt to filter directly by \"Regression\" and \"numpy.polynomial\" without broader strategies led to missed connections.\n- **Limitations of Filtered Search:** Specific searches within filtered parameters did not return useful results, likely omitting relevant issues.\n### New Plan\n- **Broaden Initial Search:**\n  - Use general search engines with broader terms like \"numpy.polynomial regression label issue\" to identify potential GitHub links or discussions.\n- **Refine Using GitHub Metadata:**\n  - Look at details and comments in related issues mentioned in search results where \"Regression\" and \"polynomial\" are discussed, even without specific labels.\n- **Flexibly Use Timelines:**\n  - Once potential issues are identified, focus on their timelines to find when labels were added or changed.\n- **Explore External References:**\n  - Check external forums, discussions, or articles that may reference or discuss these specific issues in detail.\n- **Avoid Filter Dependency:**\n  - Don't rely solely on GitHub's internal filters; use a combination of search methods and contextual exploration. \nThis approach should help circumvent previous limitations by taking advantage of broader context and external references, rather than limiting the search to GitHub's sometimes restrictive filtering options."
