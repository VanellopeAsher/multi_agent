FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific racetrack in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that is being competed on at the two-minute mark of \"The Grand Prix\" episode.\n   - The world record time for that specific racetrack in the 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023. This information might be found on dedicated gaming record sites such as speedrun.com or other gaming forums and databases that keep track of such statistics.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The exact timing at the two-minute mark to determine which specific racetrack is being featured in the gameplay.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The episode likely showcases a sequence of races, so identifying the correct track may require examining the first few minutes of the video closely.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\nThe primary issue was the inability to access the GameGrumps YouTube channel to find the specific video and determine the racetrack at the two-minute mark. The web search results were not providing direct links or adequate information to identify the racetrack or confirm the video content.\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer: Resolve Access Issues**\n  - Use a different browser or incognito mode to access YouTube if you encounter any content blocking or consent pages.\n  - Directly search the GameGrumps channel on YouTube and look for the uploads around May 14, 2017.\n  - Identify \"The Grand Prix\" episode as it matches the date and verify if this is the correct video by summarizing the first few minutes.\n- **WebSurfer: Identify the Racetrack**\n  - Carefully watch the identified video at the two-minute mark to determine the specific racetrack being played.\n  - Use features like comments, descriptions, or video chapters (if available) to assist in identification.\n- **WebSurfer: Search for World Record**\n  - After confirming the racetrack, use gaming websites like speedrun.com to look up the world record for that track in 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023.\n- **Assistant: Format and Verify Results**\n  - Once the world record is found, format it correctly in minutes and seconds, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second.\n  - Double-check data integrity by cross-referencing with another reliable gaming records source if possible.\nThis plan prioritizes overcoming browser restrictions, correctly identifying the video and racetrack, and efficiently finding the required world record information."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nAt the two-minute mark in the YouTube video uploaded by the channel “GameGrumps” on May 14, 2017 as part of their playthrough of the game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the shows’ hosts are competing on one of the game’s racetracks. What was the world record time for that track in the game’s 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023? Express your answer in minutes and seconds, rounding the seconds to the nearest hundredth, e.g. 1:01.001.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The YouTube video was uploaded by the channel “GameGrumps” on May 14, 2017.\n   - The video is part of their playthrough of the game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.\n   - The inquiry pertains to the world record time for a racetrack in the game’s 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023.\n   - “The Grand Prix” is the seventh episode of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Game Grumps VS, released on May 14, 2017.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific racetrack in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that is being competed on at the two-minute mark of \"The Grand Prix\" episode. This might be found in episode summaries or discussions online.\n   - The world record time for that specific racetrack in the 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Identifying community resources such as forums or fan wikis that summarize or discuss individual episodes may help determine the racetrack featured.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The racetrack information might be detailed on fan websites like Fandom or in episode discussions where fans recount their favorite moments.\n   - Given difficulty accessing visual content, textual summaries or dedicated wikis may provide needed details.\nThese insights will direct us towards text-based sources and online discussions to uncover the necessary track information.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of What Went Wrong\nThe primary issue was the inability to directly view the YouTube video, which hindered our ability to identify the racetrack at the two-minute mark. Additionally, relying solely on direct video access did not account for potential issues such as content availability restrictions.\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer: Use Alternative Resources**\n  - Search for community resources, such as fan wikis or forums, discussing the GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe \"The Grand Prix\" episode to find a summary of the racetrack used around the two-minute mark.\n  - Check platforms like Fandom or Reddit where detailed episode discussions or recaps may be available.\n- **WebSurfer: Seek Summary or Episode Guides**\n  - Look for episode guides or recaps that provide a detailed description of the gameplay, possibly identifying specific tracks used in the episode.\n- **Assistant: Record World Record Data Requirements**\n  - Document the necessary attributes we need to find once the specific racetrack is identified, like the current world record time on speedrun databases.\n- **WebSurfer: Speedrun Database Query**\n  - After identifying the track, search sites like speedrun.com for the world record time in the 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023.\n- **Collaborative Cross-Verification**\n  - Assistant and WebSurfer collaborate to verify data against multiple sources if discrepancies arise during the search.\nThis plan focuses on leveraging text-based resources to ascertain video content information and navigate around restrictions hindering direct video access."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nAt the two-minute mark in the YouTube video uploaded by the channel “GameGrumps” on May 14, 2017 as part of their playthrough of the game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the shows’ hosts are competing on one of the game’s racetracks. What was the world record time for that track in the game’s 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023? Express your answer in minutes and seconds, rounding the seconds to the nearest hundredth, e.g. 1:01.001.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The YouTube video was uploaded by the channel “GameGrumps” on May 14, 2017.\n   - The video is part of their playthrough of the game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.\n   - The inquiry pertains to the world record time for a racetrack in the game’s 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023.\n   - “The Grand Prix” is the seventh episode of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Game Grumps VS, released on May 14, 2017.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific racetrack in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that is being competed on at the two-minute mark of \"The Grand Prix\" episode. This might be found in Reddit discussions or forums.\n   - The world record time for that specific racetrack in the 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Searching Reddit or similar discussion forums can provide insights through community interactions and shared experiences of the episode.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Engaging with gaming communities on Reddit may yield information on specific episodes, as fans often discuss key moments and details.\n   - Highlighting user interactions in Reddit posts could reveal accurate information through comments or direct replies.\nThese updates focus on utilizing community discussions and fan interactions as reliable sources for uncovering track information, while expanding our search to include user-generated content from forums and discussions.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of What Went Wrong\nThe primary issue was the inability to locate specific information directly related to the racetrack featured at the two-minute mark of the episode. Despite browsing Reddit and Fandom, specific discussions or summaries were not accessed properly, and engagement with detailed Reddit comments or a focused search in the subreddit’s comments section was not attempted.\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer: Targeted Reddit Exploration**\n  - Search within Reddit specifically for comments or threads that mention the racetrack featured at the two-minute mark of the episode.\n  - Focus on sorting comments by relevance or looking for highlighted comments that might indicate key information.\n- **WebSurfer: Utilize Advanced Search Techniques**\n  - Use advanced search operators within Reddit and other forums to locate specific mentions of tracks used in the episode.\n- **Assistant: Compile Data Requirements**\n  - Specify the exact data needed once the racetrack is identified, particularly focusing on searching for the track's world record time.\n- **WebSurfer: Speedrun Leaderboards**\n  - After determining the track, immediately look up speedrun leaderboards and records tailored to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, especially databases like speedrun.com.\n- **WebSurfer: Alternate Forum Searches**\n  - If Reddit doesn't provide the needed information, consider searching on other platform-specific forums or game-specific communities.\nThis plan emphasizes a more structured search within specific community platforms, focusing on detailed comments and discussions."
