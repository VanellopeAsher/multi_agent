      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nAs of August 2023, who is the only winner of the US version of Survivor to be born in the month of May?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request asks for the winner of the US version of Survivor who was born in the month of May.\n   - The information should be up-to-date as of August 2023.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - A list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - The birth dates of each of these winners.\n   - Specific databases or authoritative sources, such as \"Survivor\" fan sites, Wikipedia, or official CBS press releases, could be consulted for accurate information.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which winner among the list of \"Survivor\" winners was born in May by comparing their birth dates.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - None applicable, as this request involves specific factual information rather than conjecture.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Ask WebSurfer to perform a search for the list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n- Once the list of winners is obtained, ask WebSurfer to search for the birth dates of each winner, focusing particularly on identifying any who were born in May.\n- Use the collected data to identify which winner, if any, was born in May and confirm this information."
