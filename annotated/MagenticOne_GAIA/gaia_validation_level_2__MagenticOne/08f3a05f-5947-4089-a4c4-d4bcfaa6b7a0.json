      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nGiven $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - Initial value \\( x_0 = -5 \\)\n   - Function \\( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \\)\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Specifics or nuances of Newton's Method, which could be found in calculus textbooks or reputable online math resources. However, assuming familiarity, this isn’t immediately necessary.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Derivative of the function, \\( f'(x) \\), to use Newton's Method.\n   - Iterations of Newton's Method until the value of \\( x \\) converges and \\( n = n+1 \\) after rounding to four decimal places.\n   - Calculation of new values for \\( x \\) using Newton's Method: \\( x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\).\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Newton's Method generally requires the computation of successive approximations until two consecutive approximations round to the same value to four decimal places. The process typically involves both algebraic manipulation and iterative computation.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Calculate the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \\). This can be performed manually and verified using Python.\n- Implement Newton's Method using a Python script to determine the sequence of approximations.\n  - Define the function \\( f(x) \\) and its derivative \\( f'(x) \\).\n  - Use the initial value \\( x_0 = -5 \\).\n  - Iterate using the formula: \\( x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\) until two successive approximations are equal when rounded to four decimal places.\n- Run the Python script in the ComputerTerminal to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the condition is met.\n- Verify and present the result."
