      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nWho composed the song that was performed by a rooster and a hamster in separate animated videos at separate tempos with different lyrics? Answer using the format First name Last name.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - A song was performed by a rooster and a hamster in separate animated videos.\n   - The performances were at separate tempos and with different lyrics.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Identity of the song and composer matching the description of featuring both a rooster and a hamster in animated videos.\n   - Details about these animated videos, specifically which platforms or series they might belong to, such as YouTube or specific animation studios.\n   - Verification sources could include online databases like IMDb, YouTube itself, or music and animation trivia databases.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine if the description fits any known viral video trends or series where animals animate or 'perform' songs.\n   - Analyze whether there are any known songs typically represented in varying forms of animation with animals in popular digital culture.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - A potential deduction might lead one to consider viral animations involving animal characters known for their novelty appeals, such as \"Crazy Frog,\" \"Gummy Bear Song,\" or similar viral characters.\n   - These types of videos often remix popular songs with different lyrics and characters.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Use WebSurfer to perform a web search for animated videos featuring a song performed by a rooster and a hamster at separate tempos with different lyrics. Look for any specific details about the song, its composer, and the videos.\n- If WebSurfer finds any relevant information, have it verify the composer of the song and check the details of the videos to ensure they fit the description provided.\n- Use WebSurfer to search music databases, video hosting platforms (like YouTube), or relevant trivia sites that might feature viral videos involving animals performing songs.\n- If WebSurfer identifies the song but not its composer, have WebSurfer search specifically for the composer's name once the song title is known."
