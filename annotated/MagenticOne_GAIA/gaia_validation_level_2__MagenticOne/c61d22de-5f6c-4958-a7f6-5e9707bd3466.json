      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nA paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - A paper about AI regulation was submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022.\n   - The paper includes a figure with three axes, each having a label word at both ends.\n   - A Physics and Society article was submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific words used as labels on the axes in the AI regulation paper from June 2022 on arXiv.org.\n   - The words used to describe types of society in the Physics and Society article submitted on August 11, 2016, to arXiv.org.\n   - The content of the figure in the AI regulation paper, particularly the axis labels, which might require accessing arXiv.org.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Potential correlations or connections between the labels on the axes from the AI regulation paper and the words describing societies in the 2016 article.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The context or focus areas of both papers may relate to societal impacts or frameworks, which could provide insight into why specific words might be used in both documents.\n   - Common themes in AI regulation and societal studies could include concepts like \"democracy,\" \"autocracy,\" \"utopia,\" \"dystopia,\" etc., which might appear as axis labels or social descriptors.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: Conduct a search on arXiv.org to locate the AI regulation paper submitted in June 2022. Identify and summarize the words used on the axes of the figure in the paper.\n- **WebSurfer**: Conduct another search on arXiv.org to find the Physics and Society article submitted on August 11, 2016. Identify and extract any words used to describe a type of society within the article.\n- **Assistant**: Evaluate the overlap between the words found in the AI regulation paper's axis labels and those found in the Physics and Society article. Identify which word(s) from the 2016 article appear on the axes of the 2022 paper.\n- Report the findings based on the match between the words from the two articles, thus answering the original request."

Scott, \nXuan Zhao, \nGourab K. Patro, \nGjergji Kasneci, \nKatharina Kinder-KurlandaWith increasing digitalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous. AI-based systems to identify, optimize, automate, and scale solutions to complex economic and societal problems are being proposed and implemented. This has motivated regulation efforts, including the Proposal of an EU AI Act. This interdisciplinary position paper considers various concerns surrounding fairness and discrimination in AI, and discusses how AI regulations address them, focusing on (but not limited to) the Proposal. We first look at AI and fairness through the lenses of law, (AI) industry, sociotechnology, and (moral) philosophy, and present various perspectives. Then, we map these perspectives along three axes of interests: (i) Standardization vs. Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential vs. Deontological ethics which leads us to identify a pattern of common arguments and tensions between these axes. Positioning the discussion within the axes of interest and with a focus on reconciling the key tensions, we identify and propose the roles AI Regulation should take to make the endeavor of the AI Act a success in terms of AI fairness concerns. \nComments:\nIn proceedings of AAAI/ACM Conference AIES 2022 (\nthis https URL)\nSubjects:\nComputers and Society (cs.CY)Cite as:\narXiv:2207.01510 [cs.CY] \n(or \narXiv:2207.01510v1 [cs.CY] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.01510\nFocus to learn more\nRelated DOI: \nhttps://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534158\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Gourab K Patro [\nview email] \n[v1] Wed, 8 Jun 2022 12:32:08 UTC (113 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license\n Current browse context: \ncs.CY\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2022-07 Change to browse by: \ncsReferences & Citations\nNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \n(What is the Explorer?)Connected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers \n(What is Connected Papers?)Litmaps Toggle\nLitmaps \n(What is Litmaps?)Code, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2207.01510: Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01510v1\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"With increasing digitalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous.

We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record (Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can be clearly seen. \nComments:\n23 pages, 8 figures\nSubjects:\nPhysics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)\nCite as:\narXiv:1608.03637 [physics.soc-ph] \n(or \narXiv:1608.03637v1 [physics.soc-ph] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.03637\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Renato Vicente [\nview email] \n[v1] Thu, 11 Aug 2016 23:38:23 UTC (2,695 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license Current browse context: \nphysics.soc-ph\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2016-08 Change to browse by: \ncscs.SIphysicsReferences & Citations\nNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \n(What is the Explorer?)Connected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers \n(What is Connected Papers?)Litmaps Toggle\nLitmaps \n(What is Litmaps?)Code, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 1608.03637: Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637v1\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans.
