      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nI went to Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago for my birthday on March 22, 2021 and the main course I had was delicious!  Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The dining experience occurred at Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago on March 22, 2021.\n   - A subsequent visit happened approximately one month later, on April 21, 2021, when the main course was no longer available.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on March 22, 2021.\n   - The dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on April 21, 2021.\n   - These can be found using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The specific main course that was present on March 22, 2021, but absent on April 21, 2021.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It is likely that the menu changed due to seasonal availability or a periodic update of offerings by the restaurant.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: Use the Wayback Machine to access the archived dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on March 22, 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Use the Wayback Machine to access the archived dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on April 21, 2021.\n- **Assistant**: Compare the two archived menus to identify the main course that was available on March 22, 2021, but not on April 21, 2021."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nI went to Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago for my birthday on March 22, 2021 and the main course I had was delicious!  Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nCertainly! Here's the updated fact sheet with some educated guesses:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The dining experience occurred at Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago on March 22, 2021.\n   - A subsequent visit happened approximately one month later, on April 21, 2021, when the main course was no longer available.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on March 22, 2021.\n   - The dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on April 21, 2021.\n   - These can be found using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The specific main course that was present on March 22, 2021, but absent on April 21, 2021.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It is likely that the menu changed due to seasonal availability or a periodic update of offerings by the restaurant.\n   - Accessing a snapshot of the website on the Wayback Machine might require checking close dates if March 22, 2021, or April 21, 2021, are unavailable.\n   - Focus on identifying key menu changes within March and April 2021 to spot the specific dish.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\nThe main issue was navigating the Wayback Machine efficiently and locating the correct dates for the Virtue restaurant's menu. There seemed to be some confusion in selecting the correct snapshot dates and ensuring the navigation focused on retrieving menu information promptly.\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer**: \n  - Start by directly accessing the Wayback Machine.\n  - Use the URL `www.virtuerestaurant.com` to see all snapshots.\n  - Look for snapshots available around March 22, 2021. If none, search for nearby dates.\n  - Repeat the process for April 21, 2021.\n- **Assistant**:\n  - Check for any menu changes between March and April 2021 if direct date snapshots aren’t available.\n  - Compare retrieved menus to identify which main course was removed. Focus on entries that appear unique to the March menu.\n- **General Tips**:\n  - Ensure the correct year (2021) is being targeted on the Wayback Machine.\n  - If no snapshots are exactly available, look for the closest ones before and after the targeted dates.\n  - Summarize and list notable differences in menu items to pinpoint the concerned dish efficiently.\nThis plan aims to focus on efficient snapshot access and precise comparison to prevent recurring navigation issues."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nI went to Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago for my birthday on March 22, 2021 and the main course I had was delicious!  Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nCertainly! Here's an updated fact sheet for our task:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The dining experience occurred at Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago on March 22, 2021.\n   - A subsequent visit happened approximately one month later, on April 21, 2021, when the main course was no longer available.\n   - The Wayback Machine snapshots from March 6, 2021, and April 15, 2021, are accessible for comparison.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Examine the menu details in the snapshots from March 6, 2021, and April 15, 2021, to identify main course differences.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The specific main course that was available on March 22, 2021, but absent on or near April 21, 2021.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Menu changes may be based on seasonal availability or special events.\n   - The main course could be a seasonal dish or a limited-time offering.\n   - Comparing the menus from both snapshots should reveal the missing item.\nThis updated fact sheet incorporates our current knowledge of available snapshots and sets a clear path for identifying the missing main course.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- We encountered difficulties navigating the Wayback Machine dates efficiently and didn't isolate the relevant snapshots for menu comparison.\n- There was some confusion with selecting and accessing specific snapshots.\n- We didn't clearly specify the steps to identify the missing menu item by checking both snapshots.\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - **Access Snapshots:** Open the Wayback Machine and search for 'www.virtuerestaurant.com'.\n  - **Select Dates:** Specifically look for the March 6, 2021, and April 15, 2021, snapshots.\n  - **Capture Menus:** Access these snapshots and take note of the main courses listed on both dates.\n- **Assistant:**\n  - **Compare Menus:** Analyze the captured menus to identify differences.\n  - **Isolate Missing Item:** Determine which main course is missing from the April snapshot but present in March.\n- **General Tips:**\n  - Focus on the \"Main Course\" section of the menu to minimize irrelevant information.\n  - Clearly document the main courses from each snapshot for easy comparison.\n  - Ensure that steps are followed in order to prevent repeating errors.\nThis plan should help avoid previous navigation issues and focus on detailed comparison to identify the missing main course."
