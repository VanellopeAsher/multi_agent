If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The article titled \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" by David Greetham is published in Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, pages 45-46.\n   - The citation includes a DOI: 10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The exact wording of the quote, \"obscured not by a 'cloak of print' but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission,\" from the cited article in the source mentioned.\n   - Whether Project MUSE database provides access to this article and contains the correct text.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None in this context as it involves direct fact-checking from a source rather than interpretation or deduction.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - If the text and pages in the citation match those typically used in academic works, the article should be accessible via academic databases, specifically the DOI provided, which suggests standard academic indexing.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Engage WebSurfer**: Ask WebSurfer to access Project MUSE and find the article \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" by David Greetham using the given DOI: 10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44.\n- **Locate the Text**: WebSurfer should locate the specific quoted text \"obscured not by a 'cloak of print' but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission\" within the article, specifically on pages 45-46.\n- **Verify the Quotation**: Ask WebSurfer to verify if this text matches exactly as quoted in the request. \n- **Identify Any Discrepancies**: If there is a discrepancy, WebSurfer should identify the difference and note the correct word or phrasing. \nThis plan focuses on leveraging WebSurfer's ability to access and analyze web content to confirm the accuracy of the citation. If any local files need to be analyzed, FileSurfer might be used, but web access is primary for this task."

      "content": "The essay \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\" by David Greetham explores the challenges of establishing a \"psychic connection\" with historical authors during his editorial and critical career. Greetham recounts his efforts to identify authors like John Trevisa and Thomas Hoccleve as \"father figures,\" which ultimately led to an exploration of complex models for translating texts. The narrative illustrates his shift from a focus on singular authorial identity to a broader emphasis on \"authoriality,\" reflecting on the limitations of previous editorial principles. Greetham's journey is marked by a rejection of idealized author-text relationships in favor of understanding texts as socialized entities, influencing his later work and the founding of the Society for Textual Scholarship.\nThe essay also delves into Greetham's editorial procedures, such as using autograph manuscripts of Hoccleve's other works to inform his editing, challenging existing norms. His work exemplifies a shift from traditional, often formalist approaches to text editing towards embracing variant and \"contaminated\" texts as integral to understanding the social context of literature. Greetham concludes by recognizing the value of multiple authorial influences on his career, advocating for a nuanced approach to textual scholarship that accommodates diverse editorial experiences and theoretical insights."

      "content": "In \"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s),\" David Greetham reflects on his career efforts to identify with a literary \"father figure\" through the study of authors such as John Trevisa and Thomas Hoccleve. Initially, Greetham sought an authorial connection to guide his editorial work, creating complex models for understanding textual relationships and exploring the psyches behind texts. However, he later questioned the editorial principles he once embraced, recognizing the value in the variability and socialization of texts instead. This shift led him to explore authoriality over authorship and acknowledge the limitations and pretensions in his earlier approaches. Greetham's journey reflects a broader exploration of textual scholarship, influenced by the ideas of various theorists and a growing awareness of the social dimensions of texts.\nUltimately, Greetham embraces a broader, more inclusive approach to textual criticism, unburdened by the need to align with a singular authorial figure. His work evolved into a celebration of the diversity of texts and editing practices, contributing significantly to the field with the founding of the Society for Textual Scholarship and other scholarly endeavors. He reflects on his academic journey with a focus on understanding the complexities of textual transmission and the joys of scholarly exploration, as evidenced in his book \"The Pleasures of Contamination.\""
