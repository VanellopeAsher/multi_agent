What is the absolute difference between the chapter numbers of the chapters that the titles of these two paintings quote?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation contains a footnote 397.\n   - There are two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection as of August 2023 whose titles are sourced from the same work referenced in footnote 397.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The work referenced in footnote 397 of Federico Lauria’s 2014 dissertation. This information should be found within Lauria's dissertation.\n   - The titles of paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum that are sourced from this work. This information can be checked in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection database.\n   - The chapter numbers of the chapters from which the titles of the paintings are quoted. This information would likely be in the same work referenced in footnote 397.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The absolute difference between the chapter numbers of the chapters from which the titles of the two paintings quote.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The work referenced might be a well-known literary work given it has influenced both a dissertation and artwork titles. Possible guesses could include classic literature or philosophical texts often referenced in academic works.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for and identify the specific work referenced in footnote 397 of Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation. This may involve finding the dissertation online and locating footnote 397.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection to identify paintings whose titles are sourced from the work identified in the previous step. Note down these titles.\n- **WebSurfer**: Determine the chapter numbers from which the titles of the identified paintings are derived. This will require accessing the table of contents or relevant sections of the identified work.\n- **Assistant**: Calculate the absolute difference between the chapter numbers obtained in the previous step.\n- **Assistant**: Report the final result."

My biggest debt goes to\nJulien Deonna. With him, I discovered the joys of analytic philosophy. I discovered also how thinking\ncan be both elegant and intuitive. I also met one of my best friends, someone who took care of me,\nincluding my doubts and sorrows, as few supervisors and people would do. I wish to sincerely thank\nhim and I hope that the present work as well as my admiration for him can contribute to doing him\njustice.\nMy second godfather, to  whom  I wish to express my  gratitude as well, is Gianfranco Soldati. With\nhim,  I  discovered  how  thinking  can  be  deep  and  imaginative  at  the  same  time.  All  along,  his\nsupervision  helped  me  clarify  my  thoughts,  with  respect  and  patience.  His  comments,  sweet\nencouragements and friendship were precious in the elaboration of this work. I wish to sincerely thank\nhim for having been so nice and generous with me all these years.\nFinally, my last godfather, to whom I owe a great debt as well, is Kevin Mulligan. With his profound\ncomments,  his  elegance,  and  his  sense  of  humour,  Kevin  made  the  duration  of  this  Ph.D.  into  five\nstimulating years of intellectual delight. I wish to thank him as well for his support.\nIn  addition  to  these  people,  I  wish  to  thank  the  members  of  the  Thumos  research  group  for  their\nenthusiastic  insights  and  for  their  precious  friendship.  I  owe  much  in  particular  to  Fabrice  Teroni,\nOlivier  Massin,  Amanda  Garcia,  Otto  Bruun,  Alain  Pé-Curto  and  Michele  Ombrato.  Extending  the\ncircle, I wish to express my gratitude to the members of the Philosophy Department in Geneva and\nFribourg.  In  particular,  Philipp  Blum,  Fabrice  Correia,  Julien  Dutant,  Ghislain  Guigon,  and  Anne\nMeylan helped me discover distinct facets of philosophy and kindly supported me all along. All these\npeople made my stay in Geneva a pleasant and precious time.\nI  wish  to  thank  also  the  people  who  have  been  patient  enough  to  read  previous  versions  of  this\ndissertation,  namely  Otto  Bruun,  Alexander  Bown,  Richard  Dub,  Davide  Fassio,  Daniel  Friedrich,\nGhislain Guigon, Alex Gregory, Clare MacCumhaill, Hichem Naar, Alexander Skiles, Fabrice Teroni,\nand David Wall.\nLast,  but  not  least,  I  wish  to  thank  all  my  family  and  friends  for  their  support.  Some  of  them  are\nangels,  in  particular  my  parents  Carmine  and  Rosina,  my  sisters  Maria  and  Giusi,  Amanda  Garcia,\nManon Giger, Ghislain Guigon, Stephan Kobloth, Laurence Rohrbach, Nadia Stango, Leili Yahr, and\nBoris\nWeber.\nTable of content\nAbstract ................................................................................................................................................. i\nIntroduction ......................................................................................................................................... 1\n0.1.\n0.2.\n0.3.\n0.4.\nThe Issue – The Intentionality of Desire ............................................................................................... 2\nStandard Views of Desires – Evaluations and Motivations .................................................................. 4\nThe Claim – The Deontic View of Desire ............................................................................................. 7\nDesiderata for a Promising Account of Desire ..................................................................................... 8\n0.4.1.\nDesiderative Direction of Fit ........................................................................................................"

As  we  have  motivated  the  thought  that  standard  views  of\ndesire cannot easily account for the DODP, this provides the deontic view with a significant\nadvantage.\n6.1. Formulating the DODP\nThe DODP – or at least a similar principle – has an important historical pedigree, as revealed\nby  the  following  quotations  from  major  figures  of  Ancient,  Medieval  and  Modern\nphilosophy, from Plato and Aquinas to Descartes, Locke, Hobbes and Sartre.\n“\nAnd does he [i.e. Love] long for whatever it is he longs for, and is he in love with it, when he’s\ngot it, or when he hasn’t?\nWhen he hasn’t got it, probably.\nThen isn’t it probable, said Socrates, or rather isn’t it certain that everything longs for what it\nlacks, and nothing longs for what it doesn’t lack? I can’t help thinking, Agathon, that that’s about as\ncertain as anything could be. Don’t you think so?392\n“\nAnd when you say, I desire that which I have and nothing else, is not your meaning that you\nwant in the future what you have at present? He desires that what he has at present may be preserved to\nhim in the future, which is equivalent to saying that he desires something which is non-existent to him,\nand which as yet he has not got.”393\n “Pleasurable good is the object of concupiscence, not absolutely, but considered as absent; just as the\nsensible, considered as past, is the object of memory.”394\n“It is evident that [desire] ever regards the future (…). (…) we desire to acquire a good which we do\nnot  yet  have,  or  avoid  an  evil  which  we  judge  may  occur;  but  also  when  we  only  anticipate  the\nconservation of a good or absence of an evil, which is as far as this passion may extend (…)”395\n“The uneasiness a man finds in himself upon the absence of anything whose present enjoyment carries\nthe idea of delight with it, is that we call desire.”396 (italic mine)\n392 Plato, Symposium in Silverman 2000: 173.\n393 Plato, Idem in Oddie 2005: 71-72.\n394 Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Ia IIae, 30, 2 ad1.\n395 Descartes, Passions of the Soul [57], in Baier 1986: 47.\n396 Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, II, 20, 6 in Silverman 2000: 174.\n215\n“That  which  men  Desire  they  are  also  sayd  to  Love:  and  to  Hate  those  things  for  which  they  have\nAversion.  So  that  Desire,  and  Love,  are  the  same  thing;  save  that  by  Desire,  we  always  signify  the\nAbsence of the Object; by Love, most commonly the Presence of the same. So also by Aversion, we\nsignify the Absence, and by Hate, the Presence of the Object.”397\n“Desire is doomed to failure” because its satisfaction (pleasure) precipitates its elimination398.\nDespite  its  historical  pedigree,  the  explanation  of  the  DODP  is  often  neglected  by\ncontemporary philosophers, as observed by Kenny:\n“Aquinas pointed out that it is as impossible to want what one already has as to remember what is now\nhappening. ... This obvious condition is something strangely neglected by philosophers.”399\nIn  order  to  redress  this  imbalance,  it  is  necessary  to  formulate  the  principle  carefully  and\ndistinguish it from similar principles.\nThe DODP  indeed is  to  be distinguished  from  the principles stated in  most of  the previous\nquotations.  Indeed, most of them state the impossibility of desires about  obtaining states of\naffairs.  Desire,  in  a  sense,  is  necessarily  about  absences  or  non-obtaining  states  of  affairs,\nwhich can be formulated as follows:\nAbsence – A desire for p necessarily ceases to exist if p, i.e. if the desire is satisfied.400\nThis in turn motivates the idea that desires are necessarily directed at the future, as stated in\nsome  quotations.401  One  might  however  resist  this  restriction  of  the  range  of  absences  to\nfuture states of affairs by thinking that past states of affairs also constitute absences.\nFormulated  as  such,  “absence”  is  false.  Indeed,  it  is  possible  that  one  goes  on  desiring\nsomething although the  desire has been satisfied. For instance, Sam  might  desire to  see the\nNiagara  Falls,  while  standing  in  front  of  them,  but  falsely  believing  that  he  is  front  of  the\nVictoria Falls. The satisfaction of his desire, i.e. the obtaining of the state of affairs desired,\n397 Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan [6], in Silverman 2000: 174.\n398 Sartre, Being and Nothingness, p. 615 in Silverman 2000: 227.\n399 Kenny 1963: 115–116.\n400 See Kenny 1963: 72-74.\n401 See Baier’s interpretation of Hobbes in Baier 1986: 46. See Sumner 2000: 13. See Feldman 2004: 62 for an\nobjection to this view.\n216\ndoes not prevent the subject from having the corresponding desire. In other words, a subject\nwho does not believe that p obtains might as well desire that p, despite the state of affairs p\nbeing actual.\nMoreover, a subject falsely believing that p will cease to desire p, despite the state of affairs p\nnot  obtaining. Although this does not constitute a counter-example to  “Absence”, this case,\nconjoined with the previous observation, suggests that the belief"

What is the absolute difference between the chapter numbers of the chapters that the titles of these two paintings quote?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nSure, here’s the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation contains a footnote 397.\n   - Footnote 397 references Thomas Hobbes' \"Leviathan.\"\n   - The work \"Leviathan\" influences titles of two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection as of August 2023.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific titles of the paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum quoting \"Leviathan.\"\n   - The chapter numbers from which these paintings derive their titles.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The absolute difference between the chapter numbers referenced in the titles of the two paintings.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - \"Leviathan\" is known for its exploration of the social contract and statecraft, suggesting the chapters quoted may relate to these themes. These sections are likely popular references.\nExplanation:\nWe now know that footnote 397 in Lauria's dissertation references Thomas Hobbes' \"Leviathan,\" strengthening the hypothesis that this work is key to both the dissertation and the artwork titles. The next logical step is to identify the paintings and the specific chapters they reference within \"Leviathan.\"\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of Failure\n- The challenge was identifying chapter numbers related to artworks from \"Leviathan\" in the Smithsonian Museum. Web searches didn't clearly yield results, and the museum's database search returned no matches, indicating potentially incorrect search terms or insufficient available data.\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for a comprehensive list of artworks in the Smithsonian American Art Museum that mention \"Leviathan\" or refer to Thomas Hobbes. Use broader terms like \"artworks referencing Leviathan in Smithsonian.\"\n- **WebSurfer**: Find another source (academic publications, databases, or authoritative art websites) that may list artworks with philosophical references, focusing specifically on \"Leviathan.\"\n- **WebSurfer**: Once artworks are identified, search directly for detailed descriptions or critiques highlighting the chapter references in \"Leviathan.\" Use phrases like \"chapter reference in artworks quoting Leviathan.\"\n- **Assistant**: If chapter information for the artworks is obtained, calculate the absolute difference in chapter numbers.\n- **Assistant**: Double-check that encountered issues (like specific search terms) are avoided and revise search strategies if needed, based on feedback from blocked searches."

This supports the likelihood that the paintings have philosophical references aligning with major themes from Hobbes's work. Updating the educated guesses helps focus further searches on identifying specific connections within these philosophical domains.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of Failure\n- The search did not directly yield the specific artworks referencing \"Leviathan\" with chapter details. This may be due to overly broad or ineffective search terms not directly pinpointing artworks with chapter-specific references.\n### New Plan\n- **Refine Search Strategy**: \n  - **WebSurfer**: Use more specific search terms such as \"Smithsonian paintings Leviathan chapter references\" or \"artworks in Smithsonian quoting Leviathan chapters.\"\n  - Target well-known chapters or quotes from \"Leviathan\" likely to appear in art.\n- **Explore Alternative Sources**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for academic papers or reviews discussing artworks influenced by \"Leviathan\" in art journals or books.\n  - Check online art databases or catalogs that may have detailed entries.\n- **Cross-reference**:\n  - **Assistant**: Once potential artworks with chapter information are identified, confirm the chapter numbers from an online source or a digital copy of \"Leviathan.\"\n- **Calculate Difference**:\n  - **Assistant**: Compute the absolute difference between the chapter numbers once identified.\n- **Adapt if Necessary**:\n  - **Assistant**: If direct information isn't found, adapt the plan by widening the search to include interviews, articles, or curatorial notes discussing “Leviathan” in art contexts."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nThe work referenced in footnote 397 of Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation is also the source for the titles of two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection, as of August 2023. What is the absolute difference between the chapter numbers of the chapters that the titles of these two paintings quote?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation contains a footnote 397.\n   - Footnote 397 references Thomas Hobbes' \"Leviathan.\"\n   - \"Leviathan\" influences titles of two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection as of August 2023.\n   - No direct results have surfaced confirming the specific paintings or their chapter references using current search methods.\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific titles of the paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum quoting \"Leviathan.\"\n   - Reliable sources or catalog entries that confirm which chapters are referenced in the paintings' titles.\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The absolute difference between the chapter numbers referenced in the titles of the two paintings.\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - \"Leviathan\" is known for its exploration of the social contract and statecraft, suggesting the chapters quoted may relate to sovereignty, governance, or human nature.\n   - Titles of the paintings might be exact quotes or concepts from specific chapters.\n   - The chapters referenced could be high-impact and frequently discussed ones (such as discussions on the state of nature or the formation of the commonwealth).\n   - Art catalog descriptions or exhibitions might mention chapter numbers directly or indirectly.\n**Explanation:**\nSearch results have not directly provided the needed information but suggest the importance of examining exhibition catalogs or detailed artwork descriptions. The focus remains on identifying interconnections between Hobbes's themes and potential chapter references useful in art contexts. Further searches should aim for detailed Smithsonian art records or academic publications that analyze these relationships.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of Failure\n- **Root Cause**: The search approach was too broad and did not target specific catalogs or detailed records that might contain the needed information. Repeated similar searches did not narrow down the results sufficiently to locate the required chapter references.\n### New Plan\n- **Targeted Search**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a more focused search by accessing the Smithsonian American Art Museum's catalog directly. Look for detailed descriptions or curator notes on paintings inspired by \"Leviathan.\"\n- **Explore Academic Resources**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for academic papers, articles, or reviews discussing \"Leviathan\" references in art specifically related to paintings in the Smithsonian collection.\n- **Direct Inquiry**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for a contact email or inquiry form on the Smithsonian's website to ask about artwork descriptions involving \"Leviathan.\"\n- **Verify Against Primary Source**:\n  - **FileSurfer**: Use an available copy of \"Leviathan\" to confirm chapter quotes and numbers if potentially matching titles are found.\n- **Back-up Plan**:\n  - **Assistant**: If online resources continue to be unproductive, attempt using a tool or script via **ComputerTerminal** to crawl through the Smithsonian's digital catalog or archive pages if accessible.\nBy refining the search strategy and incorporating potential direct inquiries, the plan aims to uncover specific details effectively."
