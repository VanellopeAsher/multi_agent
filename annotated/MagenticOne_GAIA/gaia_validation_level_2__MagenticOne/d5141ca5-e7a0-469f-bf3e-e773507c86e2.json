      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nWhen was a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect? Answer using the format DD/MM/YYYY.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves identifying when a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas was first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of Double Effect.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - To find the information requested, one would need to look up the edit history of the Wikipedia page \"Principle of double effect\" to see when a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas was first added.\n   - This can be specifically found by accessing the Wikipedia page and reviewing its revision history.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Comparing different revisions of the Wikipedia page to determine when the image was added would involve identifying the point at which content changed to include the image.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - If any knowledge of typical Wikipedia contributor behavior could help anticipate when such additions might commonly be made, it might offer context during exploration, but this is speculative.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Ask WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page on \"Principle of Double Effect.\"\n- Request WebSurfer to access and review the edit history of the page.\n- Instruct WebSurfer to look for the specific edit where an image of St. Thomas Aquinas was first added.\n- Once found, have WebSurfer report back with the date (DD/MM/YYYY) of the edit when the image was introduced."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nWhen was a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect? Answer using the format DD/MM/YYYY.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n**Updated Fact Sheet**\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The task is to determine when a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas was first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of Double Effect.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page is accessible and contains timestamps and summaries of each edit.\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - We need to specifically identify the revision in the Wikipedia edit history where an image of St. Thomas Aquinas was introduced.\n   - This may involve searching for keywords related to image additions like \"added image\" or \"St. Thomas Aquinas.\"\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Tracking each revision systematically, noting specifically those with larger byte differences, could indicate substantial content additions like images.\n   - Use of detailed edit summaries by contributors could offer clear indications about image additions.\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Wikipedia contributors often include edits related to images with notable byte increases; revisions that show significant changes are likely candidates.\n   - Searching for specific keywords or using filters in the edit history may expedite finding image-related changes.\n   - Based on user feedback from search attempts, identifying the appropriate keywords for filtering can optimize the revision search process.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Root Cause of Failure\n- The primary issue was not effectively identifying the specific edit where the image of St. Thomas Aquinas was added to the Wikipedia page. This was due to a lack of targeted filtering or searching within the edit history for image additions.\n- The search attempt for filtering methods did not yield practical solutions for directly identifying image additions.\n### New Plan\n- **Review Revision History Thoroughly**: Access the Wikipedia page revision history and systematically examine the edit summaries for keywords related to image additions (e.g., \"image,\" \"photo,\" \"file\").\n- **Use Byte Size as a Clue**: Focus on revisions with significant increases in byte size, as these might indicate the addition of images.\n- **Leverage Keywords in Search**: Utilize specific terms like \"St. Thomas Aquinas\" or \"image added\" to look for related summaries that can pinpoint the revision.\n- **Utilize External Tools**: Consider searching for external tools or extensions that specifically highlight image additions in Wikipedia history if direct search doesn’t yield results.\n- **Continual Tracking**: Keep a detailed track of all revisions checked to avoid repetition and ensure a systematic approach to locating the addition."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nWhen was a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect? Answer using the format DD/MM/YYYY.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n**Updated Fact Sheet**\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The task is to determine when a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas was first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of Double Effect.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page is accessible and contains timestamps and summaries of each edit.\n   - We have attempted to access the Wikipedia page but encountered challenges with navigating directly to it.\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - We need to specifically identify the revision in the Wikipedia edit history where an image of St. Thomas Aquinas was introduced.\n   - This may involve searching or filtering revision history using keywords like \"added image\" or \"St. Thomas Aquinas.\"\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Tracking each revision systematically, noting those with larger byte differences, could indicate substantial content additions like images.\n   - Contributors' detailed edit summaries might offer clear indications regarding image additions.\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Wikipedia contributors often include edits related to images with notable byte increases, so revisions with significant changes are likely candidates.\n   - Attempting to navigate and view the Wikipedia page's revision history directly and efficiently by closing unnecessary pop-ups is essential.\n   - Attempting different approaches such as cookies consent and directly accessing the correct Wikipedia link may resolve navigation issues.\n   - Considering utilizing external tools or extensions for analyzing Wikipedia edits if direct methods are proving challenging.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Root Cause of Failure\n- The primary issue was the inability to successfully navigate to the correct Wikipedia page and access its revision history due to pop-ups and possibly incorrect links.\n- The navigation process was not completed, leading to repeated visits to the search engine rather than reaching the desired Wikipedia page.\n### New Plan\n- **Navigate Correctly**: Ensure to directly click on the correct Wikipedia link. Check the page URL is \"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_double_effect\".\n- **Manage Pop-Ups**: Accept cookies or close any pop-ups promptly to avoid interference with navigation.\n- **Access Revision History**: Once on the page, locate and click the \"View history\" tab to access the revision history.\n- **Keyword Search**: Use the find function (Ctrl+F) on the browser to search for keywords like \"Aquinas\" or \"image\" in edit summaries.\n- **Byte Increase Indicators**: Look for revisions with substantial byte increases as potential image additions.\n- **Use External Tools**: If difficulties persist, consider recommending or using tools/extensions like 'WikiBlame' to track specific content additions.\n- **Systematic Approach**: Document each step and ensure no steps are repeated unnecessarily."

The first known example of double-effect reasoning is \nThomas Aquinas' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work \nSumma Theologica.\n[1]This set of criteria states that, if an action has foreseeable harmful effects that are practically inseparable from the good effect, it is justifiable if the following are true:\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Principle of double effect\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_double_effect\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1423147\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1423147\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2003-06-17T21:20:12Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-01-02T18:49:44Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Verheerlijking_van_de_Heilige_Thomas_van_Aquino%2C_RP-P-1908-2123.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"set of ethical criteria permitting certain actions when one's otherwise legitimate act may also cause harm\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.21\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Verheerlijking_van_de_Heilige_Thomas_van_Aquino%2C_RP-P-1908-2123.jpg/960px-Verheerlijking_van_de_Heilige_Thomas_van_Aquino%2C_RP-P-1908-2123.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"854\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Principle of double effect - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

For the ship that sank in 2013, see \nMV St. Thomas Aquinas. For other uses, see \nAquinas (disambiguation).\nIn this medieval Italian name, the name \nAquinas is an indicator of birthplace, not a \nfamily name; the person is properly referred to by the \ngiven name, \nThomas.\nSaintThomas AquinasOPThomas Aquinas \nOP (\n/əˈkwaɪnəs/ ⓘ \nə-KWY-nəs; \nItalian: \nTommaso d'Aquino, \nlit. 'Thomas of \nAquino'; \nc. 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian\n[6] \nDominican \nfriar and \npriest, the foremost \nScholastic thinker,\n[7] as well as one of the most influential philosophers and theologians in the Western tradition.\n[8] He was from the county of \nAquino in the \nKingdom of Sicily. \nThomas was a proponent of \nnatural theology and the father of a school of thought (encompassing both theology and philosophy) known as \nThomism. Central to his thought was the doctrine of \nnatural law, which he argued was accessible to \nhuman reason and grounded in the very nature of human beings, providing a basis for understanding \nindividual rights and \nmoral duties.\n[9] He argued that God is the source of the light of natural reason and the light of faith.\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Thomas Aquinas\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9438\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9438\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2001-10-22T18:31:44Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-03-27T19:57:57Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/St-thomas-aquinasFXD.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, Catholic priest, and Doctor of the Church\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.22\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/St-thomas-aquinasFXD.jpg/960px-St-thomas-aquinasFXD.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"959\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Thomas Aquinas - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

An image can be \ntwo-dimensional, such as a \ndrawing, \npainting, or \nphotograph, or \nthree-dimensional, such as a \ncarving or \nsculpture. Images may be displayed through other media, including a \nprojection on a surface, activation of electronic signals, or \ndigital displays; they can also be reproduced through mechanical means, such as \nphotography, \nprintmaking, or \nphotocopying. Images can also be \nanimated through digital or physical processes. \nIn the context of \nsignal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).\n[1] In \noptics, the term \nimage (or \noptical image) refers specifically to the reproduction of an object formed by light waves coming from the object.\n[2]A \nvolatile image exists or is perceived only for a short period.

Answer using the format DD/MM/YYYY.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n**Updated Fact Sheet**\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The task is to determine when a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas was first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of Double Effect.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page is accessible and contains timestamps and summaries of each edit.\n   - We have successfully accessed the Wikipedia page and its revision history.\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Identify the specific revision where an image of St. Thomas Aquinas was introduced.\n   - Search or filter the revision history using keywords like \"Aquinas\" or \"image.\"\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Larger byte differences in revisions could indicate substantial content additions like images.\n   - Analyzing contributor summaries may reveal specific mentions of image additions or modifications.\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Revisions with significant byte increases are likely candidates for image additions.\n   - Utilizing the keyword search feature and looking for edit summaries with relevant terms like \"Aquinas\" or \"image\" can help pinpoint the addition.\n   - Continuous navigation to the correct page and closing pop-ups are crucial steps.\n   - If direct methods are challenging, using external tools or extensions like 'WikiBlame' might help track specific content additions.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Root Cause of Failure\n- The main issue was the incorrect use of the search function, leading to navigation away from the relevant page. Instead of searching within the revision history, the search was performed in Wikipedia's general search bar, taking us to unrelated articles.\n### New Plan\n- **Navigate Correctly**: Use the correct search functionality within the revision history to look for key terms like \"Aquinas\" or \"image\".\n- **Target Byte Changes**: Focus on edits with significant byte changes, which may indicate the addition of images.\n- **Avoid General Search**: Ensure any keyword search is performed in the revision history page, rather than the main Wikipedia search bar.\n- **Manage Pop-Ups**: Accept cookies and close any interfering pop-ups promptly to avoid navigation issues.\n- **Systematic Review**: Start from the latest revisions and work backward to streamline the process.\n- **External Tools**: If necessary, consider utilizing tools like 'WikiBlame' for finding specific edits if manual navigation continues to pose challenges."

The first known example of double-effect reasoning is \nThomas Aquinas' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work \nSumma Theologica.\n[1]This set of criteria states that, if an action has foreseeable harmful effects that are practically inseparable from the good effect, it is justifiable if the following are true:\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Principle of double effect\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_double_effect\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1423147\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1423147\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2003-06-17T21:20:12Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-01-02T18:49:44Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Verheerlijking_van_de_Heilige_Thomas_van_Aquino%2C_RP-P-1908-2123.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"set of ethical criteria permitting certain actions when one's otherwise legitimate act may also cause harm\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.21\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Verheerlijking_van_de_Heilige_Thomas_van_Aquino%2C_RP-P-1908-2123.jpg/960px-Verheerlijking_van_de_Heilige_Thomas_van_Aquino%2C_RP-P-1908-2123.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"854\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Principle of double effect - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
