Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - Manash Pratim Kashyap and PS Fader conducted studies on customer retention.\n   - The studies were published during 2018-2019.\n   - There is a two-word type of model common to these studies, with no punctuation.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Specific details on the type of models used in customer retention studies by Manash Pratim Kashyap and PS Fader around 2018-2019. This can likely be found in academic publications, such as journals on marketing or business analytics.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - If explicit information about the model is not readily available, it may be necessary to deduce the common two-word model type based on commonalities in customer retention studies from that period.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Based on common knowledge in customer retention and analytics models, one possible guess could be \"Markov Model,\" \"Survival Model,\" or \"Cohort Analysis,\" as these are often used in customer retention studies.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer Task**: Use WebSurfer to conduct a search for academic publications or articles by Manash Pratim Kashyap and PS Fader on customer retention from 2018-2019. Focus on identifying the type of models used in these studies.\n- **WebSurfer Task**: Once articles are found, summarize or search within the articles for mentions of specific models used. Look for the mention of a two-word model that is common in both studies.\n- **Assistant Task**: If WebSurfer provides a summary or specific model names, analyze the information to determine if a two-word model is part of the findings. If necessary, use general knowledge to confirm if the model is commonly used in customer retention studies.\n- **Assistant Task**: Conclude by presenting the likely common two-word model based on the information obtained.\nThe focus will be on employing WebSurfer to locate and extract pertinent information about the studies and the models used."
