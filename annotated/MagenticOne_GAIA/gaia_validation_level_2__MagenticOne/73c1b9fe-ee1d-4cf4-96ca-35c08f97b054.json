Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request asks for the year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas, not including Texas.\n   - The data source mentioned is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific year when American Alligators were first observed west of Texas outside of the state. This information might be available in records or reports from the USGS.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None specifically required, as the request is more about historical data lookup.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It might be quite recent, considering alligators traditionally inhabit the southeastern U.S., primarily in states like Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. Any movement outside of these areas would likely be noted in recent decades due to environmental changes or human intervention.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Ask WebSurfer to search for information regarding when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas, according to the USGS.\n- Instruct WebSurfer to look for any official reports or historical data entries from the USGS website or reliable wildlife databases that document the presence of the American Alligator in regions west of Texas.\n- Once the specific year is identified, confirm the accuracy of the data by cross-referencing at least two reputable sources.\n- Report the findings back with the specific year and any notable context or details provided by the sources."

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure. The section is now dynamically updated from the NAS database to ensure that it contains the most current and accurate information. Occurrences are summarized in Table 1, alphabetically by state, with years of earliest and most recent observations, and the tally and names of drainages where the species was observed. The table contains hyperlinks to collections tables of specimens based on the states, years, and drainages selected. References to specimens that were not obtained through sighting reports and personal communications are found through the hyperlink in the Table 1 caption or through the individual specimens linked in the collections tables.\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\",\n        \"Description\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998).
