      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nOn the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016, what feature caused the largest bubble to be the size it is?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016.\n- The request is about identifying the feature that caused the largest bubble to be the size it is.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Details about the DeepFruits project and its fruit detection graph, specifically from the year 2016.\n- Connected Papers, and how it represents data, specifically how bubble sizes are determined in their graphs.\n- The criteria or methodology used by Connected Papers for visualizing data, which might impact bubble sizes on the graph.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- How features of DeepFruits could impact bubble size on a graph, as it could involve metrics like citation counts, publication influence, or network centrality. These would need to be understood in the context of Connected Papers' visualization logic.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The largest bubble likely corresponds to a pivotal or highly influential paper or dataset associated with DeepFruits, potentially based on citation count or network centrality.\n- Based on typical graphing methods, the bubble size could correlate with the number of citations or relevance/importance given by the academic community or within the dataset's connections.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Web Research**: Instruct WebSurfer to investigate the DeepFruits fruit detection project from 2016, focusing specifically on information regarding its fruit detection graph on Connected Papers, to understand how bubble sizes are determined.\n- **Investigate Connected Papers**: Ask WebSurfer to specifically focus on how Connected Papers visualizes data, what attributes affect the size of bubbles on their graphs, and whether there is published documentation or explanations about these attributes (e.g., citation counts, publication influence).\n- **Data Analysis**: Based on the information retrieved, identify the potential features that most likely contribute to the size of the largest bubble in the context of DeepFruits, using logical deduction based on found elements such as citation metrics or influential connections.\n- **Summarize Findings**: Compile the collected data and analyses to derive a well-reasoned conclusion that addresses the original question about what feature caused the largest bubble to be the size it is on the DeepFruits fruit detection graph."

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The task involves understanding the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016.\n- Connected Papers visualizations show bubble size based on citation count, as confirmed by multiple sources.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Specific information about DeepFruits’ publication or dataset in 2016 that may be showcased on Connected Papers.\n- Any specific attributes or metrics associated with DeepFruits papers that might influence bubble size beyond citations, such as bibliographic coupling.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The significance of DeepFruits in the academic context through its citation impact or network centrality on Connected Papers.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The largest bubble is very likely linked to the paper with the highest citation count associated with DeepFruits because citation count is confirmed to influence bubble size.\n- The DeepFruits paper from 2016 is potentially a foundational work or widely recognized in its field, leading to its prominence on the graph.\n**Reasoning**: The consistent confirmation across sources that bubble size is influenced by citation count strengthens the link between the largest bubble and the publication’s influence. The focus now should be narrowing down specific influential papers related to DeepFruits.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- **Lack of Specific Results**: Searches didn't yield specific information about the DeepFruits 2016 project on Connected Papers.\n- **Repeating Searches with Limited Variability**: Attempts focused on generic queries without pinpointing detailed records or scholarly attributes tied to DeepFruits.\n- **Cookie Pop-up Disruption**: The search experience was affected by pop-ups, slowing down the retrieval of information.\n### New Plan\n- **Targeted Search for DeepFruits**:\n  - Ask WebSurfer to look up academic databases or repositories (e.g., Google Scholar, ResearchGate) for DeepFruits 2016 citations and impact.\n  - Try searching for references to DeepFruits in scholarly communications that might contribute to bubble size in Connected Papers.\n- **Focused Investigation on Connected Papers**:\n  - Instruct WebSurfer to find official documentation or user-community discussions about how bubble sizes are determined, verifying if there's anything supplementary to citation counts (e.g., bibliographic coupling).\n- **Utilize Browser Tools Efficiently**:\n  - WebSurfer should manage cookie pop-ups quickly to keep focus on search tasks. Use provided options to dismiss or handle pop-ups efficiently.\n- **Comprehensive Information Gathering**:\n  - Aggregate data on DeepFruits papers and identify common data points that could affect bubble size, providing an educated analysis based on citations and bibliographic metrics.\n- **Summarize Useful Findings**:\n  - Gather any new insights or specific details about DeepFruits and organize them to answer the question conclusively, clearly explaining any identified feature influencing bubble size."

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's a revised fact sheet with updated insights based on our progress so far:\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The task involves understanding the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016.\n   - Connected Papers visualizations show bubble size influenced primarily by citation count. This is a consistent finding across multiple sources. \n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific information about the 2016 DeepFruits publication or dataset, such as its relative citation count or scholarly impact as reflected on Connected Papers.\n   - Attributes or metrics associated with DeepFruits papers beyond just citation count, such as bibliographic coupling or network centrality metrics that might influence bubble size.\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The possible correlation between the prominence of the DeepFruits paper (in terms of citation count) and its influence on the size of the largest bubble on Connected Papers.\n   - Any possible academic networks or collaborations that might amplify the paper's perceived importance on Connected Papers.\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The largest bubble on DeepFruits’ graph is most likely due to the paper's high citation count, but there is also a possibility of additional factors like bibliographic coupling contributing to its size.\n   - DeepFruits might represent either a seminal paper within its field or have substantial interdisciplinary relevance, impacting its citation frequency and network importance.\n**Reasoning**: The repeatedly verified fact that citation count directly affects bubble size guides us toward examining specific influential papers related to DeepFruits. However, exploring possible additional contributing factors such as bibliographic coupling remains a worthwhile endeavor to fully understand the nuances behind the graph's bubble sizes.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong:\n- **Inadequate Specific Search**: The previous attempts to locate specific information about DeepFruits' publication failed to pinpoint essential details needed to answer the question.\n- **Over-reliance on Citation Count**: There was an assumption that citation count was the only factor, without fully verifying or seeking additional influential metrics specific to Connected Papers.\n- **Lack of Contextual Understanding**: There was insufficient exploration of potential academic networks or the broader impact of DeepFruits within its field that might influence bubble size indirectly.\n### New Plan:\n- **Targeted Search for DeepFruits Publication Details**:\n  - **WebSurfer** should look for specific DeepFruits' publications related to the 2016 dataset or paper in academic databases like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or IEEE Xplore to gather precise citation information.\n  - Explore the DeepFruits project's collaborations and co-authorship networks that could enhance its citation network influence.\n- **Analysis of Connected Papers Metrics**: \n  - **WebSurfer** should search for Connected Papers documentation or user-community discussions to confirm if bibliographic coupling, co-citation, or network centrality metrics contribute to the graph's bubble size for a comprehensive understanding of influencing features.\n- **Aggregating Relevant Data**:\n  - Collect citation counts, network influence indicators, and correlations with bibliographic metrics for DeepFruits related papers and analyze their collective impact on bubble size.\n- **Synthesize Findings**:\n  - Conclude with a well-rounded explanation that includes insights from both citation metrics and other possible factors contributing to the observed bubble size on the Connected Papers graph.\nBy adopting a diversified approach and cross-verifying with Connected Papers’ specific metrics, we can ensure a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the size of the largest bubble related to DeepFruits."

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet with revised insights based on our progress and any new information we might consider:\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The task involves understanding the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016.\n   - Connected Papers visualizations show bubble size influenced primarily by citation count. This is a consistent finding across multiple sources.\n   - Citation count remains the primary and most significant factor influencing bubble size on Connected Papers graphs, indicating scholarly impact and relevance over time.\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific citation counts and related academic metrics for the 2016 DeepFruits publication or dataset to confirm its scholarly impact.\n   - Explore whether other factors like bibliographic coupling or co-citation might also influence bubble size on Connected Papers, as per official documentation or academic analyses.\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Analyze if DeepFruits' prominence (citation count) directly correlates with the size of the largest bubble, confirming its status as a high-impact publication.\n   - Investigate DeepFruits' potential collaborations, interdisciplinary influence, or seminal contributions within its field that might bolster its academic network visibility.\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The largest bubble on DeepFruits’ graph is most likely due to the paper's high citation count, strengthened by its potential central role in a collaborative network of research or its interdisciplinary applications.\n   - Any seminal aspects of the DeepFruits work, such as innovative fruit detection methodologies or significant real-world applications, could contribute to its broader academic uptake and influence on the bubble size.\n   - Ongoing discussions or user feedback in communities focused on Connected Papers might reveal evolving metrics or features that contribute to graph dynamics beyond known factors.\n**Reasoning**: Continuous emphasis on citation count as a determinant of bubble size reinforces the need to verify DeepFruits' academic impact through specific metrics. Simultaneously, considering additional impact areas like interdisciplinary relevance or collaborative strength adds depth to understanding the graph dynamics. Exploring such factors can uncover potential influences beyond basic citation metrics, enhancing our insight into the graph's bubble sizes.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong:\n- **Inadequate Specificity**: There was insufficient specificity in looking up the exact publication or dataset related to DeepFruits (2016), resulting in a vague understanding of its citation metrics and impact.\n- **Over-reliance on Citation Count**: The prior plans centered too significantly around citation counts without fully verifying or seeking additional influential metrics specific to Connected Papers, such as bibliographic coupling or network centrality metrics.\n- **Lack of Contextual Exploration**: There was inadequate exploration of potential academic networks or the broader impact of DeepFruits within its field, which might indirectly influence bubble size.\n### New Plan:\n- **Targeted Research for DeepFruits Publication Details**:\n  - **WebSurfer** should conduct a highly focused search for specific DeepFruits' publications or datasets from 2016 in academic databases like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or IEEE Xplore.\n  - Gather citation counts, journal impact factors, and related academic metrics to establish precision on its influence.\n- **Deep Exploration of Connected Papers' Metrics**:\n  - **WebSurfer** should actively search for Connected Papers’ official documentation or user-community discussions to ascertain additional factors (e.g., bibliographic coupling, co-citation) potentially affecting the graph's bubble size.\n  - Verify if broader metrics or evolving features influence bubble size apart from citation counts directly.\n- **Examine Academic Context and Influence**:\n  - Analyze the potential academic networks, interdisciplinary relevance, or significant contributions of DeepFruits to ascertain its visibility and influence within its research community.\n  - Explore related projects or collaborations that could enhance DeepFruits' academic network influence graphically.\n- **Synthesize and Correlate Findings**:\n  - Integrate findings from targeted research, documentation, and community discussions into a detailed explanation that precisely outlines the responsible factors for the observed bubble size on the Connected Papers graph.\n  - Ensure the comprehensive understanding explicitly addresses both the direct contributions (citations) and possible indirect factors (network relevance) affecting the graph dynamics.\nFollowing this structured approach, emphasizing specificity and comprehensive metrics analysis, should prevent repeating past challenges and ensure a well-rounded understanding of the factors contributing to the DeepFruits graph bubble size."

The aim is to build an accurate, fast and reliable fruit detection system, which is a vital element of an autonomous agricultural robotic platform; it is a key element for fruit yield estimation and automated harvesting. Recent work in deep neural networks has led to the development of a state-of-the-art object detector termed Faster Region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN). We adapt this model, through transfer learning, for the task of fruit detection using imagery obtained from two modalities: colour (RGB) and Near-Infrared (NIR). Early and late fusion methods are explored for combining the multi-modal (RGB and NIR) information. This leads to a novel multi-modal Faster R-CNN model, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior work with the F1 score, which takes into account both precision and recall performances improving from 0.807 to 0.838 for the detection of sweet pepper.

The aim is to build an accurate, fast and reliable fruit detection system, which is a vital element of an autonomous agricultural robotic platform; it is a key element for fruit yield estimation and automated harvesting. Recent work in deep neural networks has led to the development of a state-of-the-art object detector termed Faster Region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN). We adapt this model, through transfer learning, for the task of fruit detection using imagery obtained from two modalities: colour (RGB) and Near-Infrared (NIR). Early and late fusion methods are explored for combining the multi-modal (RGB and NIR) information. This leads to a novel multi-modal Faster R-CNN model, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior work with the F1 score, which takes into account both precision and recall performances improving from 0.807 to 0.838 for the detection of sweet pepper. In addition to improved accuracy, this approach is also much quicker to deploy for new fruits, as it requires bounding box annotation rather than pixel-level annotation (annotating bounding boxes is approximately an order of magnitude quicker to perform). The model is retrained to perform the detection of seven fruits, with the entire process taking four hours to annotate and train the new model per fruit.\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0\",\n        \"title\": \"Connected Papers | Find and explore academic papers\",\n        \"description\": \"Connected Papers is a visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find academic papers relevant to their field of work.\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://www.connectedpapers.com/share-preview-img.png\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Connected Papers | Find and explore academic papers\",\n        \"og:description\": \"A unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work.\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
