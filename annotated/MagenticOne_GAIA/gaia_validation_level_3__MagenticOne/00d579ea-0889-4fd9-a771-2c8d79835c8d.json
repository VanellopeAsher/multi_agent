      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nAssuming scientists in the famous youtube video The Thinking Machine (Artificial Intelligence in the 1960s) were interviewed the same year, what is the name of the scientist predicting the sooner thinking machines or robots? Answer using the format First name Last name\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - None specified in the request.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The YouTube video \"The Thinking Machine (Artificial Intelligence in the 1960s)\" to verify the names of the scientists interviewed.\n   - Specific scientist predictions about when thinking machines or robots would become a reality, as mentioned in the video.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - If the exact year of the interviews is not stated explicitly, it may need to be derived from the context within the video or the publication date.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The timeframe of the 1960s for when the interviews likely took place, based on the video's title.\n   - Common leading AI scientists of the 1960s who might have appeared in such a video, such as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, or Herbert Simon.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- WebSurfer will be tasked with locating the specific YouTube video titled \"The Thinking Machine (Artificial Intelligence in the 1960s)\" to gather detailed information on the content and identify any scientists named in the video.\n- WebSurfer will then look for any transcriptions or descriptions of the video that might specify which scientist predicted the sooner arrival of thinking machines or robots.\n- If WebSurfer cannot find a transcription, WebSurfer will summarize the key points from the video, focusing on any scientist predictions regarding the timeline of thinking machines or robots.\n- Assistant will review the gathered information to determine the scientist who predicted the sooner arrival of thinking machines or robots and verify their name in the format \"First name Last name.\""

Answer using the format First name Last name\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The YouTube video \"The Thinking Machine (Artificial Intelligence in the 1960s)\" mentions interviews with AI pioneers Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, and Claude Shannon.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Specific predictions made by these scientists about when thinking machines or robots would become a reality, as mentioned in the video.\n   - Any documented statements by these scientists in academic papers or historical texts about the timeline of AI advancements.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The exact year the video or interviews were conducted, inferred from the context or publication information available.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The interviews took place in the 1960s, aligning with the video's title.\n   - Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, and Claude Shannon are likely figures who made predictions regarding AI, given their noted presence in the video.\n   - Exploring academic papers or historical analyses mentioning these scientists might provide insights into their predictions.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- **Inability to Load the Video**: Attempts to access the YouTube video were unsuccessful due to loading errors.\n- **Difficulty Finding Transcripts**: Searches for a transcript or detailed description of the video did not yield useful results.\n- **Lack of Specific Predictions**: The search did not effectively locate information on the specific predictions made by Jerome Wiesner or others.\n### New Plan\n- **Target Scholarly and Historical Sources**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for academic papers or historical books that cover the 1960s predictions in AI. Specifically look for scholarly discussion involving Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, and Claude Shannon.\n- **Refine Search Keywords**:\n  - Use precise keywords focused on AI predictions, such as \"Jerome Wiesner 1960s AI prediction details\" or \"Oliver Selfridge AI predictions history.\"\n- **Check AI History Archives**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Explore archives or websites dedicated to the history of artificial intelligence, which might include detailed accounts and predictions.\n- **Analyze Related Articles**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for articles discussing the impact of the interviewed scientists on AI predictions to gather indirect information.\n- **Synthesize Information**:\n  - **Assistant**: Compile and analyze collected information to determine which scientist predicted the sooner arrival of thinking machines or robots.\nBy leveraging targeted historical and academic resources, the approach should gather more specific and informative results about the scientists' predictions."

Answer using the format First name Last name\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The YouTube video \"The Thinking Machine (Artificial Intelligence in the 1960s)\" includes interviews with AI pioneers Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, and Claude Shannon.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Specific predictions from these scientists about when thinking machines or robots would become a reality.\n   - Any statements in academic papers or historical texts by these scientists regarding AI timelines.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The exact year of the interviews, inferred from available publication information or historical context.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The interviews were conducted in the 1960s, reflecting the video's title.\n   - Oliver Selfridge is particularly known for his pioneering work in early AI and may have made optimistic predictions about AI advancements.\n   - Searching JSTOR, Google Scholar, or archive.org might uncover relevant predictions or discussions by these scientists.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- **Lack of Specific Information**: Searches on scholarly sites like JSTOR and sites with historical significance did not yield clear information regarding specific predictions by the scientists.\n- **Navigation Issues**: Encountered difficulties accessing and navigating to relevant content on scholarly databases and encountering loading errors or navigation issues.\n- **Unfocused Searches**: Attempted searches without clear leads directly referencing the scientists' predictions or interviews.\n### New Plan\n- **Targeted Scholarly Search**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Conduct specific searches on JSTOR, Google Scholar, and archive.org with refined keywords, such as “1960s AI predictions by Jerome Wiesner” or “Claude Shannon AI predictions interviews.”\n- **Historical Archive Search**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look into archives focused on AI history to find references to interviews or notable quotations from the scientists.\n- **Secondary Sources**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for reviews, summaries, or secondary analyses of \"The Thinking Machine\" video or similar resources where predictions might be discussed.\n- **Combine Sources**:\n  - **Assistant**: Compile information from any articles, papers, or secondary sources found to identify who predicted the sooner advancement of thinking machines.\nBy focusing on refined searches and utilizing a combination of scholarly databases and historical archives, the plan aims to gather specific information on the predictions made by the scientists in context."

The history of AI is a history of fantasies, possibilities, demonstrations, and promise. Ever since Homer wrote of me-chanical “tripods” waiting on the gods at din-ner, imagined mechanical assistants have been a part of our culture.A (Very) Brief History of Artificial Intelligence - SMUs2.smu.edu\nWhen was artificial intelligence invented?\nIt was demonstrated at the 1956 Dartmouth conference on artificial intelligence, the meeting that gave AI its name. Newell and Simon (1972) acknowledge the convincingness of Oliver Selfridge’s early demonstration of a symbol-manipulation pro-gram for pattern recognition (see Feigenbaum and Feldman ).A (Very) Brief History of Artificial Intelligence - SMUs2.smu.edu\nWhat was the first book describing AI programs?\nWhile early conference proceedings contain descriptions of many of these programs, the first book collecting descriptions of working AI programs was Edward Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman’s 1963 book, Computers and Thought.A (Very) Brief History of Artificial Intelligence - SMUs2.smu.edu\nFeedbackmemphis.edu\nhttps://ccrg.cs.memphis.edu › assets › papers\n · PDF file\nHistory, motivations and core themes of AI - University of Memphis\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"SystemEntropyOriginTrialToken\": \"A5is4nwJJVnhaJpUr1URgj4vvAXSiHoK0VBbM9fawMskbDUj9WUREpa3JzGAo6xd1Cp2voQEG1h6NQ71AsMznU8AAABxeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW5nLmNvbTo0NDMiLCJmZWF0dXJlIjoiTXNVc2VyQWdlbnRMYXVuY2hOYXZUeXBlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzUzNzQ3MjAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Grazie alla ricerca intelligente di Bing puoi trovare ci\\u00f2 che cerchi in modo semplice e rapido accumulando punti.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Bing\",\n        \"og:title\": \"site:edu early AI predictions Jerome Wiesner Claude Shannon Oliver Selfridge - Bing\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=site%3Aedu+early+AI+predictions+Jerome+Wiesner+Claude+Shannon+Oliver+Selfridge&FORM=QBLH\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"3732605936979161\",\n        \"og:image\": \"http://www.bing.com/sa/simg/facebook_sharing_5.png\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"600\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"315\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
