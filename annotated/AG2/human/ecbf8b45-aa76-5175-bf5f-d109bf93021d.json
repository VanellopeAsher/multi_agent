You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.

Let's assume they filled up 'n' packs. We need to multiply the number of packs 'n' by the number of balloons per pack (30) to find the total number of balloons. Then, we need to subtract the number of balloons left (12) from the total.\n\n```python\n# your code\nn = 10  # assuming they filled up 10 packs\nballoons_per_pack = 30\nleft_balloons = 12\n\ntotal_balloons = n * balloons_per_pack\nthrown_balloons = total_balloons - left_balloons\n\nprint(thrown_balloons)\n```\n\nPlease run this code with the actual number of packs 'n'.
