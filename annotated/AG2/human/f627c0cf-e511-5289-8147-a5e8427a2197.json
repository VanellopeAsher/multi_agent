You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark was unwell for a period of time, during which he lost 10 pounds per month.

But currently, we don't have this information. It's necessary to get the duration of Mark's unwell period.\n\nIn the given problem, the value of `m` isn't mentioned which makes it impossible to provide a definite answer.

We'll plug that into the equation and solve for Mark's initial weight.\n\n```python\n# Variables:\nm = 70  # Number of months Mark was unwell.
