  "problem": "Dave purchased a big packet of french fries and consumed fourteen before a ravenous seagull snatched the packet from his grasp. Upon landing, the seagull devoured half the quantity of french fries that Dave had consumed. Subsequently, three pigeons chased him away from the meal, and each pigeon consumed three fries. Later, a raccoon pilfered two thirds of the remaining fries. A single french fry was then carried away by ants, leaving only five behind. What was the initial quantity of french fries in the packet that Dave purchased?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.
