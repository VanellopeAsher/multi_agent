You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "Since boating takes 6 hours and swimming takes half the time spent boating, it is known that swimming will take 6 / 2 = 3 hours. Each show they watched took 2 hours, and they watched 3 shows, so the time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours. \n\nIt's known that the total time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. This amounts to 30% of the total time spent. \n\nWe can thus derive the equation 15 = 0.3 * total_time. By solving this algebraic equation, we can find out the total time they spent. \n\nThe time spent sightseeing is the difference between the total time spent and the time spent swimming, boating, and watching shows.\n\nLet's solve this step by step by using Python."
