Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThe key idea here is to use the concept of ratios also known as Proportions or Cross Multiplication. If 60 potatoes make 360 hash browns, we can set up a ratio that says:\n\n60 potatoes : 360 hash browns = 960 potatoes : X hash browns\n\nWhere X is the unknown number of hash browns we're trying to find.\n\nApproach:\nI'm going to use a Direct Python Solution to find the unknown X by cross multiplying in the ratio.\n\n```python\n# calculation\npotatoes1 = 60\nhash_browns1 = 360\npotatoes2 = 960\n\n# Use the concept of proportionality (cross multiplication)\n# We determine the amount of hash browns that can be made from 960 potatoes\n# The formula being used is (potatoes1 / hash_browns1) = (potatoes2 / hash_browns2)\nhash_browns2 = (hash_browns1 * potatoes2) / potatoes1\nhash_browns2\n```\n\nFinally, I'll print the result\n\n```python\nprint(\"You can make\", hash_browns2, \"hash browns with 960 potatoes.\")\n```"

      "content": "VERIFICATION:\n\nWe set up the problem as a ratio: 60 potatoes : 360 hash browns = 960 potatoes : X hash browns. We then used cross multiplication to solve for X, finding that X = 5760. This means that 960 potatoes will make 5760 hash browns.\n\nThis makes sense because 960 is 16 times greater than 60. So, if we multiply the number of hash browns we can make from 60 potatoes (360) by 16, we also get 5760. \n\nAfter a careful verification of the problem, I am confident that the solution is correct.\n\nHence, our final answer is that we can make 5760 hash browns with 960 potatoes.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5760}."
