Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTara bought several packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. She painted them and sold them at a craft fair for $8 each. If she earned a profit of $160 on her bags, how many packs of 5 canvas bags Tara buy?"

Each canvas bag is bought for $\\frac{4}{5}$ dollars and sold for $8 each. The profit from selling each bag is $8 - \\frac{4}{5}$ dollars. According to the problem, Tara made a total profit of $160. Let $x$ be the number of bags that Tara bought and sold.\n\nHence, we can summarize the problem in the following equation:\n\n$(8 - \\frac{4}{5})x = 160$\n\nLet's solve this equation to find the value of $x$. Then, we can find how many packs of 5 canvas bags Tara bought by dividing $x$ by 5.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the symbol x\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# define the equation\nequation = Eq((8 - Fraction(4, 5))*x , 160)\n\n# solve the equation\nbag_num = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# calculate the number of packs of 5 bags\npack_num = bag_num / 5\n\npack_num\n```"

Therefore, the total number of bags she sold can be found by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.\n\nThen to find the number of packs she bought, we need to divide the total number of bags by 5, since each pack consists of 5 bags.\n\nLet's modify our equation and calculation accordingly:\n\n```python\n# redefine the equation\nequation = Eq((8 - 0.8)*x , 160)\n\n# solve the equation with the correction\nbag_num = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# calculate the correct number of packs of 5 bags\npack_num = round(bag_num / 5)\n\npack_num\n```"
