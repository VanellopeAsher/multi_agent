Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12. Let's denote this as C.\n2. She ordered 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each. We can denote this as M and calculate it as `5 * 3.5`.\n3. She ordered 4 apples that cost $1.5 each. We can denote this as A and calculate it as `4 * 1.5`.\n4. She ordered some boxes of pizza, which we want to find. Let's denote this as P.\n5. Each box of pizza costs $8.50. \n6. The total amount paid is $52.5.\n\nFrom these, we can form the following algebraic equation:\n\n    C + M + A + P = $52.50\n    --> C(12) + M(5*3.5) + A(4*1.5) + P * 8.5 = $52.50\n    --> 12 + 17.5 + 6 + 8.5P = 52.5\n\nSolving for P gives us the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered.\n\n```python\n# variables from problem context\nC = 12\nM = 5 * 3.5\nA = 4 * 1.5\ntotal_amount_paid = 52.5\npizza_price = 8.5\n\n# form and solve equation for P\nP = (total_amount_paid - (C + M + A))/pizza_price\n\n# print solution\nprint(P)\n```"
