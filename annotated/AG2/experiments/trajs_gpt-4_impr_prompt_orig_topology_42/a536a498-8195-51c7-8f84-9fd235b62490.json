Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number.

This can be written as:\n\n```\nCourtney's Count = 1.2 * Actual Count\n```\nBy rearranging this equation:\n```\nActual Count = Courtney's Count / 1.2\n```\n\nTherefore, we can use this relationship between the actual count and Courtney's count to find out how many people Courtney reported were at the concert.\n\nLet's code it. \n\n```python\ndef find_courtneys_count(kellys_count: int) -> int:\n    courtneys_count = kellys_count / 0.8\n    return int(courtneys_count)\n\nkellys_count = 40\ncourtneys_count = find_courtneys_count(kellys_count)\nprint(courtneys_count)\n```\nThe function `find_courtneys_count` accepts `kellys_count` as input, calculates Courtney's count as the actual audience size divided by 0.8, changes this measure to an integer before returning. At the end , plug in Kelly's count and print Courtney's estimated audience size."

Therefore, if we reverse calculate this using the number we obtained for Courtney's count (50 people), we should get the figure that Kelly reported. That is, 80% (100% - 20%) of Courtney's count should equal Kelly's count.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n```\nKelly's Count = 80% of Courtney's Count\n```\n\nWe can verify this by calculation:\n\n```python\ndef verify(count_courtney, count_kelly):\n    calc_kelly = count_courtney * 0.8\n    return int(calc_kelly) == count_kelly\n\nprint(verify(courtneys_count, kellys_count))\n```\nThis function `verify` takes Courtney's and Kelly's counts, calculates 80% of Courtney's count, and checks if it matches Kelly's count. If it returns True, that means our calculation for Courtney's count is correct. run the function verify on our two values, `courtneys_count` and `kellys_count`.
