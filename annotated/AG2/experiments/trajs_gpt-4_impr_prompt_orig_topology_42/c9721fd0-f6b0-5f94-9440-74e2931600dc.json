Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

      "content": "This is a Direct Python Solution problem using basic arithmetic operations to calculate the total bill.\n\nFirst, we'll decompose the 2.25 hours of work into two full hours and 0.25 of an hour (or a fraction of an hour). Because Patty's Plumbing charges by the hour or fraction of an hour, it means they'll charge for three hours of work in this case: two full hours and one fraction.\n\nSecond, we will calculate the total cost of the hours worked by multiplying the number of hours by the rate per hour. \n\nFinally, we'll add up the initial service fee, the total cost of work hours, and the cost of parts to find the total amount billed. \n\nHere's the Python code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\n# cost per hour or fraction of an hour\nhourly_rate = 35\n\n# hours worked, separated into full hours and fraction of an hour\nhours = 2\nfraction_hour = 1\n\n# service fee\nservice_fee = 40\n\n# cost of parts\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# total cost of hours worked\ntotal_hours_cost = (hours + fraction_hour) * hourly_rate\n\n# total bill\ntotal_bill = service_fee + total_hours_cost + parts_cost\n\nprint(total_bill)\n```\n\nRun this code to find the total amount billed by Patty."

The calculation is correct and your total bill comes to $205.\n\nSo, the total amount billed by Patty is indeed $205.\n\nLet's go through the verification steps to ensure we didn't make any errors.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Patty charges $40 for a house call: $40.\n2. She worked 2.25 hours, which is billed as three hours (2 full hours + 1 fraction of an hour): 3 * $35 = $105.\n3. The cost of parts was $60.\n4. Adding these up, we get total cost: $40 (service fee) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.\n\nSo, we can be sure that our solution is verified.\n\nHence, the final answer is $205. Let me box that for you.\n\nThe total amount billed by Patty is $boxed{205} dollars."
