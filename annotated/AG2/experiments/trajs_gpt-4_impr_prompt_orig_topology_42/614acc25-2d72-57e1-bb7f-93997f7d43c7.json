Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLast night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?"

W1 = 10     (Rick killed ten wolves on first day)\n2. W2 = 3C2    (Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars)\n3. C2 = C1 - 3 (Today Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night)\n\nUsing the above 3 equations we can find the values of C1, W2 and C2. Once we get those values, the total number of animals killed can be found using the equation W1 + C1 + W2 + C2."

So, let's assume it be C1.\n\nAlso, given \"Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars\".\nWe can write this as W2=3*C2.\n\nAnd \"Today Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.\"\nSo, we have C2 = C1 - 3.\n\nFrom the above-given equations, we can see the relation of C2 in W2 as well as C1. But we don't have values for any of the variables. We can't solve the problem without the number of cougars he killed last night. We need this data to find out the total count of animals. \n\nHence, we can't compute the total number of animals that Rick killed.\n\nSo, the answer to this problem is None. \nI will represent this in the \\boxed{} available in the response."
