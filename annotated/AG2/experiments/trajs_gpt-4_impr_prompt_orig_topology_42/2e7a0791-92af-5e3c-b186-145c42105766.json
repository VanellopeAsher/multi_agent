Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.

He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?"

He did half of the total 10,000 steps by walking to and from school, which is 10,000/2 = 5,000 steps. He then did another 1,000 and 500 steps going for a walk and shopping respectively. \n\nSecond, we determine how many steps Elliott did for his jog by subtracting the steps done before he went for a jog from the total steps he had taken after he had finished his jog. \n\nLetâ€™s translate this logic into Python.\n\n```python\n# total steps Elliott is trying to walk in a day\ntotal_steps = 10000\n\n# steps done walking to and from school (half of total steps)\nschool_steps = total_steps / 2  \n\n# steps done walking with friend\nfriend_walk_steps = 1000 \n\n# steps done shopping\nshopping_steps = 500 \n\n# steps left after jog\nsteps_left_after_jog = 2000 \n\n# calculating steps done before Elliott went for a jog\nsteps_done_before_jog = school_steps +  friend_walk_steps + shopping_steps\n\n# calculating steps done during jog\njog_steps = total_steps - steps_left_after_jog - steps_done_before_jog\n\nprint(jog_steps)\n```\n\nNow, run the code and provide the numerical output."

The total steps Elliot is trying to walk in a day is 10,000.\n2. He did half of his steps while walking to and from school, which is 5,000 steps.\n3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a walk with his friend and 500 steps going shopping. \n   So, the total steps before the jog are 5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500.\n4. After the jog, he had only 2,000 steps left to take.\n5. Finally, the steps during his jog would be 10,000 (total steps) - 6,500 (steps before jog) - 2,000 (steps left) = 1,500.\n\nVerification is completed. The final answer is \n\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\] steps\n\nHe took 1500 steps during his jog."
