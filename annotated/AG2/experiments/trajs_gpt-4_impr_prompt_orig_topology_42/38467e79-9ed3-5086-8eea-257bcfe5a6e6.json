Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home. If 30 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?"

      "content": "First, let's understand the problem. If we let the total number of students in that grade level be `x`. According to the problem, two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer, meaning one-third of the students don't have it. We can translate this into an equation:\n\n1/3 * x = 30\n\nSo, we only need to solve this equation to find the total number of students in the grade level. Now, let's solve this equation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# This will automatically enable the best printer available in your environment.\ninit_printing()\n\n# Let `x` be the total number of students in that grade level.\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Create the equation.\nequation = Eq(1/3*x, 30)\n\n# Solve the equation.\ntotal_students = solve(equation, x)[0]\ntotal_students\n```\n\nNow, this code will give us the total number of students in that grade level. Please run this code to obtain the result."

We do not need the decimal in this case because the number of students should be a whole number.\n\nNow let's confirm if our answer is correct. \n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. One-third of the students do not have a desktop computer at home, which is 30 students.\n2. Two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer, which is twice the number of students that do not have computers.\n3. Therefore, the total number of students should be 30 (students without computers) * 3 (entire student population) = 90 students.\n\nOur analysis aligns with the given problem. Thus, the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of students in the grade level is boxed{90}."
