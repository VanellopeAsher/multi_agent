Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties. He spent $300 on yellow ties that cost $30 each. How much did he spend on ties?"

      "content": "The problem can be broken down step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: If $30 buys 1 yellow tie, then the number of yellow ties John bought is $300/$30 = 10 ties. \n\nStep 2: With the understanding that green ties are 70% more expensive than yellow ties (that cost $30 each), we can calculate the cost of each green tie as $30 + 70% of $30. \n\nStep 3: Itâ€™s evident that John purchased twice as many red ties as blue ties. However, without knowing the number of blue or red ties John bought, or their prices, we can't determine the total amount he spent on ties. Hence, under these circumstances, we're unable to solve the problem entirely. \n\nThus, based on this reasoning, the answer for this problem is `None`."
