Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera. Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera after the allowance and the money from selling picture. How much is the camera?"

Then we'll add the remaining money he needs to find the total price of the camera.\n\nFollowing are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of Ava's allowance Jayden received by dividing Ava's total allowance by 2.\n2. Add the amount of money Jayden received from selling pictures and the half of Ava's allowance.\n3. Add the additional $85 that Jayden needs to this total to find the price of the camera.\n\n```python\n# Here is the plan implemented in Python\n\n# Define Ava's total allowance and the money Jayden earned from selling pictures\nava_allownace_total = 90\njayden_money_pictures = 70\n\n# Caluculate the half of Ava's allowance (money Jayden received)\nava_allownace_half = ava_allownace_total / 2\n\n# Add Ava's half allowance to Jayden's money\njayden_total_money = jayden_money_pictures + ava_allownace_half\n\n# Define the additional money Jayden needs\njayden_additional_money = 85\n\n# Calculate the camera price by adding the additional  money Jayden needs to his total money \ncamera_price = jayden_total_money + jayden_additional_money\n\nprint('Camera price is $', camera_price)\n```\n\nLet's run and verify the result."

The amount of money Jayden had earlier was from his sales which was $70.\n3. Adding Ava's contribution to what Jayden had gives us $$45 + $70 = $115.\n4. Jayden still needed $85 more, which means the total cost of the camera is $115 + $85 = $200.\n\nFinal Answer: The total cost of the camera is \\boxed{200}."
