Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

To be exact, cost per class = Total cost/Number of classes. \n\nThe maximum cost per class that Manny's parents are willing to pay is $10. If Manny starts missing classes, the cost per class will increase. Therefore we need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. \n\nThis means we need to solve the inequality $60/(10 - x) >= 10 for x where x is the number of classes Manny can miss. \n\nLet's calculate this using Python. We will use the sympy library to solve the inequality."

The cost per class should not exceed $10 until he misses more than 4 classes.\n\nHere is how we can do it in Python:\n```python\nfor i in range(6):\n    print(f\"Cost per class if {i} classes missed: $\",60/(10-i))\n```\nRun this and further validate the solution."
