Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

Subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.\n\nLet's follow these steps using Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert all quantities of brownies to the same unit (individual brownies).\n# Greta made a batch for herself, this means she had 1 dozen brownies, 1 dozen is 12.\nbrownies_greta_made = 1 * 12\n\n# At her office, she was given 1/2 a dozen brownies which is equal to 6.\nbrownies_from_office = 1/2 * 12\n\n# At the party at home, there were 4 dozen brownies, which is equal to 48.\nbrownies_from_home_party = 4 * 12\n\n# Step 2: Add together all the brownies Greta had at the end of the parties.\ntotal_brownies = brownies_greta_made + brownies_from_office + brownies_from_home_party\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.\n# During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten which is equal to 18.\nbrownies_eaten = 1.5 * 12\n\n# Brownies left over\nbrownies_left_over = total_brownies - brownies_eaten\nprint(brownies_left_over)\n```"

      "content": "VERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify the result by performing a step-by-step calculation.\n\n1. Greta made a batch for herself which means she had 1 dozen brownies. One dozen is equivalent to 12, so she originally had 12 brownies.\n2. At her office, 1/2 a dozen brownies were added. Half of a dozen is 6, so her total goes up to 12 + 6 = 18.\n3. In the surprise party at home, 4 dozen more brownies were added. Four dozen is equivalent to 48, raising the total to 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.\n4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. This is equivalent to 18 brownies, which when subtracted from the total gives 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left over.\n\nYes, the result is correct. The final answer is 48.\n\nSo, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48. The final answer in the expected format is:\n\n∎boxed{48}"
