Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents, how many cents will she have left?"

      "content": "In this problem, we need to calculate how much change Kelly has left after buying a can of pop and a candy bar. \n\nHere is the step by step approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total value of Kelly's coins. Each quarter's value is 25 cents, and each dime's value is 10 cents.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the pop and candy.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the pop and candy from the total value of the coins to find out how many cents Kelly has left.\n\nBelow is the python code to implement this:\n\n```python\n# initialize the number of coins\nquarters = 5\ndimes = 2\n\n# calculate total value of Kelly's coins\ntotal_value = quarters * 25 + dimes * 10\n\n# calculate cost of pop and candy\npop_cost = 55\ncandy_cost = 45\ntotal_cost = pop_cost + candy_cost\n\n# calculate the left over\nleft_over = total_value - total_cost\nprint(left_over)\n```"
