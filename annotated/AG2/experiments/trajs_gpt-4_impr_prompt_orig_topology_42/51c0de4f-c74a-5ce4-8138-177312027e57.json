Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.

      "content": "In this problem, we know that Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund. His lawyer offered to give three times as much as everyone else combined, which sums up to $6600. If we subtract the lawyer's contribution from the total amount collected, we should find out how much his friend contributes.\n\nWe know that Walter's lawyer's donation is three times everyone else's combined donations, including his friend's contribution. Therefore, we can express the friend's donation as x. So the total sum of donations is $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from the online fund) + x (from his friend) + $6600 (from his lawyer).\n\nThe lawyer's donation is three times everyone else's donations. Therefore, we have $6600 (lawyer's contribution) = 3 * ($500 (neighbors) + $1500 (online fund) + x (friend's contribution)), and we need to solve this equation for x to find the friend's contribution.\n\nFirst, we simplify the equation and then solve it for x. \n\nSo let's start solving it now.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define x as the symbol to solve for\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# define the equation\neq = Eq(6600, 3 * (500 + 1500 + x))\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(eq, x)\n\nprint(\"The friend's contribution is $\", solution[0])\n```"
