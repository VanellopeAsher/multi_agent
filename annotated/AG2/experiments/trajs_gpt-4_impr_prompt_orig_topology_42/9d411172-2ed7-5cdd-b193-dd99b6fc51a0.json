      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $20 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 12 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?"

      "content": "Approach: \n\nWe are told that the total cost for the classes is $80, and if the cost per class exceeds $20, Manny's parents won't sign him up again. Therefore, we'll divide $80 by $20 to find out the minimum number of classes Manny has to attend so the cost per class doesn't exceed $20. \nThen subtracting this number from the total number of classes (12), will yield the maximum number of classes Manny can miss.\n\nCode:\n```python\ntotal_cost = 80\ncost_per_class_limit = 20\ntotal_classes = 12\n\nmin_classes_to_attend = total_cost / cost_per_class_limit\n\nmax_classes_to_miss = total_classes - min_classes_to_attend\n\nprint(max_classes_to_miss)\n```\nThis will give us the maximum number of classes that Manny can miss before his classes cost more than $20 per class. Let's go ahead and solve it."

That means if Manny attends 4 classes, then his cost per class is 80/4 = $20, which is the limit set by his parents.\n\nNext, we found out the maximum number of classes he can miss. He has a total of 12 classes. If he has to attend at least 4, that means he can miss 12 - 4 = 8 classes. If he misses more than 8 classes, his cost per class will increase above the limit set by his parents.\n\nAnswer: So, Manny can miss a maximum of 𝑏𝑜𝑥𝑒𝑑{8} classes before the cost per class exceeds $20."
