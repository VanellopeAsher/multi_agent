Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. Each bag of wheat weighs 60 pounds. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?"

Total expense for buying and transporting the bags = Cost of purchasing each bag + cost of transporting = $20x + $2x = $22x\n2. Total income after selling all the bags = Selling price of each bag * number of bags = $30x\n3. According to the problem, the difference between the income and the expenses is the profit which is $400.\n\nWe can form the following equation from step 3:\n\nincome - expense = profit\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n$30x - $22x = $400\n\nThis equation can be solved to find the value of x which represents the number of bags this trader bought and sold.\n\n# **Code**\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\neq = sp.Eq(30*x - 22*x, 400)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = sp.solve(eq, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```"
