Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

Then divide the remaining cards by 10, because each student had 10 cards.\n\nLet's compute this in the following steps.\n\nStep 1: Find total cards Miss Maria had initially.\n\n```python\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\nprint(total_cards)\n```\n\nStep 2: Find the cards given to students.\n\n```python\ncards_to_students = total_cards - 50\nprint(cards_to_students)\n```\n\nStep 3: Find out the number of students.\n\n```python\nnum_students = cards_to_students / 10\nprint(num_students)\n```"

With each student receiving 10 cards, this leads to a total of 30 students.\n\nVerification:\nLet's confirm this answer by following the verification steps:\n1. Miss Maria initially had 350 cards (150 basketball cards and 200 baseball cards).\n2. She kept 50 cards which leaves her with 350 - 50 = 300 cards.\n3. Each student received 10 cards, therefore, 300 cards / 10 cards per student = 30 students. This confirms that our calculations are correct.\n\nHence, Miss Maria has \boxed{30} students."
