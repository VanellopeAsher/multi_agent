Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables. She purchased 20 tomato seed packets and 80 celery seed packets for this purpose.

The total cost is obtained by combining the cost for the tomato seed packets with the cost for the celery seed packets. It involves multiplication and addition of the cost by the quantity.\n\nLet's streamline the calculation:\n1. Calculate the total cost of tomato seed packets: quantity*price\n2. Calculate the total cost of celery seed packets: quantity*price\n3. Add both costs to determine the total amount Mrs. Rylan has spent on purchasing the seeds.\n\nHere is the Python code to achieve it. \n\n```python\n# Quantity and price per unit\nqty_tomato_seeds = 20\nprice_tomato_seeds = 40\n\nqty_celery_seeds = 80\nprice_celery_seeds = 30\n\n# Calculate total costs\ncost_tomato_seeds = qty_tomato_seeds * price_tomato_seeds\ncost_celery_seeds = qty_celery_seeds * price_celery_seeds\n\n# Calculate total amount spent\ntotal_amount_spent = cost_tomato_seeds + cost_celery_seeds\n\ntotal_amount_spent\n```\n\nAfter calculating, specify the final total_amount_spent."
