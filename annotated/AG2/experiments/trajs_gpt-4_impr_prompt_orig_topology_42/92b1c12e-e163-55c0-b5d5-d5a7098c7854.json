Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. This can be translated mathematically as:\n    `45 = 2*Y - 5`\n2. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. This translates to:\n    `Y = 3*X + 4`\n\nWe can solve these equations using sympy, which enables us to perform symbolic calculations in Python. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\nX, Y = sp.symbols('X Y')  # Define the symbols\n\n# Define the equations\nequation1 = sp.Eq(2*Y - 5, 45) \nequation2 = sp.Eq(3*X + 4, Y)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = sp.solve((equation1, equation2), (X, Y))\nsolution\n```"

Checking with Carver's age, which is twice his daughter's age minus 5:\n   2*25 - 5 = 45.\n\n2. Confirming that his daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son:\n    3*7 + 4 = 25\n   \nThus, the results match the conditions given in the problem. \n\nFinally, the son of Carver is \\boxed{7} years old."
