Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

First, calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her student loan, credit card, and mortgage without the 50% increment. \n2. Then, increase these payments by 50% to find the new monthly totals. \n3. Calculate the total monthly payment after the increment.\n4. Determine the amount she pays yearly by multiplying this total monthly payment by 12.\n\nNow let's write the Python code to compute these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the total minimum monthly payment for the debts.\ntotal_min_monthly_payment = 300 + 200 + 500\n\n# Step 2: Increase the total minimum monthly payment by 50%\nincrease_50 = total_min_monthly_payment * 0.5\nnew_monthly_payment = total_min_monthly_payment + increase_50\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total amount of debt paid in a year.\ntotal_payment_yearly = new_monthly_payment * 12\n\nprint(total_payment_yearly)\n```\nThis script will calculate the total amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year.\nLet me know when you get the result, and we will verify if it is correct."

An increase of 50% on this total gives $1000 * 0.5 = $500. So, the new total monthly payment is $1000 + $500 = $1500.\n3. The total debt she paid in a year is calculated by multiplying the total monthly payment by the number of months in a year, which gives $1500 * 12 = $18000.\n\nSince the computed value 18000 matches with the expected value from our step by step verification, the final answer is indeed correct.\n\nThe total amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year is \\$18000."
