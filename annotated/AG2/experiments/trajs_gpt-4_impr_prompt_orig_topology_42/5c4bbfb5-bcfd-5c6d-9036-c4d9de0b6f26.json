Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon.

      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

      "content": "First, let's calculate the total cost of the grocery.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of a single pack of bacon by dividing the total cost of the bacon by the number of packs.\n2. At twice the cost of a pack of bacon, we can find the cost of a packet of chicken.\n3. Multiply the cost of a packet of chicken by the number of packets to get the total cost of chicken.\n4. Multiply the cost of a strawberries pack by the number of packs to get the total cost of strawberries.\n5. A pack of apples is half the price of a strawberry pack, so calculate the price.\n6. Multiply the cost of an apple pack by the number of packs to get the total cost of apples.\n7. Finally, calculate the total cost of the grocery by adding up the costs of all the items.\n8. The amount left in Kelly's budget would be her total budget minus the total cost of the grocery. \n\nLet's represent all these calculations in code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\nbacon_packs = 5\nbacon_total_cost= 10.5\n\nchicken_packs = 6 \n\nstrawberries_packs = 3\nstrawberries_pack_cost = 4.5\n\napples_packs = 7\n\nbudget = 65\n\n#calculate cost of single pack of bacon\nbacon_pack_cost = bacon_total_cost/bacon_packs\n\n#calculate cost of single pack of chicken\nchicken_pack_cost = 2*bacon_pack_cost\n\n#calculate total cost of chicken\nchicken_total_cost = chicken_packs*chicken_pack_cost\n\n#calculate total cost of strawberries\nstrawberries_total_cost = strawberries_packs*strawberries_pack_cost\n\n#calculate cost of single pack of apple\napple_pack_cost = strawberries_pack_cost/2\n\n#calculate total cost of apples\napples_total_cost = apples_packs*apple_pack_cost\n\n#calculate total cost of grocery\ngrocery_cost = bacon_total_cost + chicken_total_cost + strawberries_total_cost + apples_total_cost\n\n#calculate amount left in budget\nbudget_left = budget - grocery_cost\nprint(budget_left)\n```\nVerify the calculations and then return the final answer."
