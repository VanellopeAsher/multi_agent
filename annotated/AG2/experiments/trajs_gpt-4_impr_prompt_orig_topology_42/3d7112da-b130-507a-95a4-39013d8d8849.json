Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6.6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2.5 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

      "content": "Based on the problem, we know that:\n- John spent 6.6 hours boating.\n- He spent half that time swimming, so 6.6/2 = 3.3 hours swimming.\n- He watched 3 shows, each of which was 2.5 hours long, so 3*2.5 = 7.5 hours watching shows.\n- The time he spent on these activities (boating, swimming, watching shows) was 30% of his total time.\n- He spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. We need to find out how much time this equates to.\n\nLet's first find out how much total time he has spent. The information we are given (watching shows, boating, and swimming) constitutes 30% of the total time (as explicitly stated by the problem). Once we have the total time, we will be able to find the time spent sightseeing which is measured to be 40% of the total time.\n\nLet's do the calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# this will automatically enable the best printer available in your environment.\ninit_printing()\n\n# calculation\ntotal_time_spent_shows_boating_swimming = 7.5 + 6.6 + 3.3\n\n# let T be the total time\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# equation: 30% of total time T equals to the total time spent on shows, boating, and swimming\neq = Eq(total_time_spent_shows_boating_swimming, 0.3*T)\n\n# solve the equation for T\ntotal_time = solve(eq, T)[0]\n\n# now calculate the time spent sightseeing\ntime_sightseeing = 0.4 * total_time\n\ntime_sightseeing\n```"

Boating time was 6.6 hours, swimming time was half of that, 3.3 hours, and show-watching time was 7.5 hours.\n2. The total time spent on these activities, according to the problem, was 30% of total time.\n3. Therefore, we solve the equation 0.3*T = 6.6 + 3.3 + 7.5 for T, our total time, which would give us about 56 hours.\n4. Finally, we calculate 40% of that total time (0.4 * total_time), which gives us approximately 23.2 hours: the amount of time that John spent sightseeing."
