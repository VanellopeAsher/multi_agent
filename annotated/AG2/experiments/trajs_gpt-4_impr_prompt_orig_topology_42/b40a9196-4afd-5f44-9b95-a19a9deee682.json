Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. If a 10% tax is applied to all items that are not food, what is the total cost of all the items?"

      "content": "This problem involves computing the total cost of multiple items using basic arithmetic and considering a tax rate. A straight direct Pythonic solution is possible by following these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost for food items (milk and eggs).\n2. Calculate the cost for not food items (light bulbs, cups, roach traps) and compute the 10% tax.\n3. Sum up the cost of both categories to yield the total cost.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python code:\n\n```python\n# define the costs of the items\nmilk = 2\neggs = 3\nlight_bulbs = 3\ncups = 3\nroach_traps = 4\n\n# calculate the cost for food items\nfood_cost = milk + eggs\n\n# calculate the cost for not food items (include tax)\nnot_food_cost = light_bulbs + cups + roach_traps\nnot_food_cost_after_tax = not_food_cost + 0.1 * not_food_cost \n\n# calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = food_cost + not_food_cost_after_tax\n\n# display the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis measure ensures that the tax is applied correctly to non-food items and that the total calculation is accurate."

The cost of food items (milk and eggs) is \\$(2 + 3) = \\$5.\n2. The cost of not food items (light bulbs, cups, roach traps) before applying the tax is \\$(3 + 3 + 4) = \\$10.\n3. After applying the 10% tax, the cost of non-food items becomes \\$10 + \\$1 (10% of \\$10) = \\$11.\n4. The total cost, therefore, is the sum of the cost of food and non-food items, i.e., \\$5 (food) + \\$11 (non-food) = \\$16.\n\nUpon confirming all these computations, I am convinced our solution is correct. \n\nTherefore, the total cost of all items is $\\boxed{16}$ dollars."
