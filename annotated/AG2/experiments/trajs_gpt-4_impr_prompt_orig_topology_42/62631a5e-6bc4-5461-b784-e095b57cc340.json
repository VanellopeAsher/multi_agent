      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAmora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 150 more corn chips than the number the others got. If Amora and Lainey got 700 corn chips each, how many corn chips were there altogether?"

These key points are:\n- Amora and Lainey got same number of corn chips: 700 each.\n- Collins got 150 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey.\n- We have to calculate total number of corn chips.\n\nApproach:\nTo calculate the total number of corn chips:\n- First, compute the number of corn chips that Collins received by adding 150 to the amount that Amora and Lainey received.\n- Then, add together the corn chips that all three received.\n\nLet's turn this into a Python program."

So, the total corn chips they got are 700 * 2 = 1400\n2. Collins got 150 more corn chips than the others. So he got 700 + 150 = 850 corn chips.\n3. The total amount of corn chips = 850 (Collins) + 1400 (Amora and Lainey) = 2250\n\nEverything matches perfectly. So, the total number of corn chips altogether is \\boxed{2250}."
