Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5.5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars."

Calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2.5 from the cost of a gallon jar.\n2. Determine the amount she'd spend on the gallon jars by multiplying the cost of a gallon jar by the number of gallon jars she plans to purchase.\n3. Compute the amount she'd spend on half-gallon jars by multiplying the cost of a half-gallon jar by the number of half-gallon jars she wants to purchase.\n4. Add these two amounts to get the total amount Cecelia needs to spend.\n\nLet's put these steps into code:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the cost of a gallon jar\ngallon_cost = 5.5\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar\nhalf_gallon_cost = gallon_cost - 2.5\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Determine the amount Cecelia would spend on the jars\nspend_gallon = 10 * gallon_cost\nspend_half_gallon = 16 * half_gallon_cost\n\n# Step 4: Compute the total amount Cecelia needs to spend\ntotal_spend = spend_gallon + spend_half_gallon\n\nprint(total_spend)\n```\n\nRunning this Python code will yield the total amount Cecelia spent on the jars."

Thus, the price of a half-gallon jar is $5.5 - $2.5 = $3. Cecelia bought 10 gallon-jars, so she spent $5.5 * 10 = $55 on gallon jars. She bought 16 half-gallon jars, costing her $3 * 16 = $48. So the total cost is $55 (for gallon jars) + $48 (for half-gallon jars) = $103.\n\nThe code provided correct output, confirming the calculations.\n\nThus, the final amount Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $103, which matches the output of our Python code. So, the final answer is boxed{103}."
