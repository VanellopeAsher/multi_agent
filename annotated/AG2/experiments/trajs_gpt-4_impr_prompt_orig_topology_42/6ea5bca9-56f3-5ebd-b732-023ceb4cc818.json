Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

So, Smendrick = 3PJ.\n\nFinally, the total amount of cards is given. Therefore we can form another equation using this information:\nBecca + Smendrick + PJ = 3.41.\n\nNow we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation and solve this system of equations.\n\nSo this problem is case 3 and we need to implement step by step process to find the solution. \n\nStep1: Convert all equations in terms of one suitable variable. Let's go for 'PJ' as its chief multiplier.\n\nStep2: Solve the derived equation to find the value of 'PJ'\n\nStep3: Substitute the obtained value of 'PJ' in Smendrick = 3PJ to get the card count of Smendrick\n\nStep4: Substitute 'Smendrick' value in terms of 'PJ' and 'Becca' in  'Becca = Smendrick + 0.12' equation to find Becca's card count."
