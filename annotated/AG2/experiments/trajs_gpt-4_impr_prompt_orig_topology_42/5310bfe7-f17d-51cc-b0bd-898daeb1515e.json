Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 30 more goals than Mark and scored 55 more goals than Anna. If Richie scored 90 goals, how many goals did all three teenagers score?"

Since Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark, Mark scored Richie's goals minus 30. Similarly, since Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna, Anna scored Richie's goals minus 55. \n\nFinally, to find the total goals of the three teenagers, we add the goals of Richie, Mark, and Anna. Let's code this up. \n\n```python\n# number of goals Richie scored\nrichie_goals = 90\n\n# number of goals Mark scored\nmark_goals = richie_goals - 30\n\n# number of goals Anna scored\nanna_goals = richie_goals - 55\n\n# total number of goals\ntotal_goals = richie_goals + mark_goals + anna_goals\n\nprint(total_goals)\n```"

Mark scored 60 goals as he scored 30 fewer goals than Richie.\n3. Anna scored 35 goals because she scored 55 fewer goals than Richie.\nIf we sum up these goals, we get 90 + 60 + 35 = 185.\n\nSo, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \\boxed{185}."
