Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJoey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble. He scores some points. Then Marcy, who has 225 points, scores 10 points. By how many points is Joey now winning?"

Therefore, we can't calculate by how many points Joey is now winning. We can only calculate this if we know how many points Joey scores in his turn. \n\nHere is the Python code for the case if we know how many points Joey scores:\n\n# Python solution for the problem\n```python\n# initial points of Joey and Marcy\njoey_score_before = 214\nmarcy_score_before = 225\nmarcy_score_after = marcy_score_before + 10  # Marcy scores 10 points\n\n# assuming joey_score_after is Joey's score after this turn\njoey_score_after = ?\n\ndifference = joey_score_after - marcy_score_after   # calculate the difference\n\n# print the result\nprint(\"Joey is now winning by\", difference, \"points.\")\n```\n\nBut as we can't determine 'joey_score_after' from the given problem, the answer is `None`. \n\nSo, the final answer is \boxed{'None'}."
