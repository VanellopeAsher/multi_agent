Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?"

      "content": "The problem is asking how much candy each of the three friends would get if they pooled together and shared it equally. We can find this solution by using direct pythonic computation. First, compute the total sum of the candy they had together and then divide it by the number of friends which is three.\n\nRemember not to take into account the Halloween toys as they are not relevant in the calculation.\n\nCode:\n```python\n# The amount of candy each of them had\nRobert_candy = 3\nCindy_candy = 5\nAaron_candy = 4\n\n# Total candy\ntotal_candy = Robert_candy + Cindy_candy + Aaron_candy\n\n# Average candy each would get if shared equally\naverage_candy = total_candy / 3\n\nprint(average_candy)\n```\n\nThis python program first calculates the total amount of candy by adding the amount each friend had. It then finds how much each would get by dividing the total number of candies by the total number of friends, which is three. The result which gets printed is the average candy each person would receive."
