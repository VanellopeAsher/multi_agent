Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDave purchased a big packet of french fries and consumed fourteen before a ravenous seagull snatched the packet from his grasp.

Therefore, before the ants arrived, there would have been 5 + 1 = 6 fries.\n- Raccoon had 1/3 of the fries, which is 6, which means before the raccoon came, there were 3 times the fries, 6 * 3 = 18.\n- Afterwards, add on the 9 fries eaten by the pigeons. That makes 18 + 9 = 27 fries.\n- The seagull ate half of what Dave had eaten, so before the seagull ate, there were twice the amount of fries. That gives us 27 * 2 = 54 fries.\n- Add the fries that Dave ate onto that gives us 54 fries + 14 fries = 68 fries.\n\nHence the initial quantity of French fries in Dave's package was 68.\n\nSo, the final answer is \bboxed{68}."
