Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?"

He runs half the distance for remaining two days.\n\nFirst, let's define:\n\n- Full-run-day: The day John runs the full distance\n- Half-run-day: The day John runs half the distance\n\nThe total distance John runs per week is the sum of the distances he runs on full-run-days and half-run-days:\n\n60 miles = 3 * distance_on_a_full-run-day + 2 * distance_on_a_half-run-day\n\nAlso, according to the problem, distance_on_a_half-run-day is half of that on a full-run-day. \n\nWe can solve this system of equations directly using sympy: \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbols\nfull_run_day, half_run_day = symbols('full_run_day half_run_day')\n\n# define the system of equations\neq1 = Eq(3*full_run_day + 2*half_run_day, 60)\neq2 = Eq(half_run_day, 0.5*full_run_day)\n\n# solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1,eq2), (full_run_day, half_run_day))\n\nprint(solution)\n```"

On two half run days, he runs 7.5 miles each, totalling 15 miles. So, 45 miles + 15 miles = 60 miles, which matches with the total distance he runs in a week as stated in the problem.\n\nHowever, further steps are needed to calculate the speed at which John runs, which require the time he takes to run each day. This information isn't given in the problem, so it is not possible to obtain the speed John runs at from the given data.
