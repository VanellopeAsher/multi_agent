  "problem": "A math teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk to write equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher is environmentally conscious and tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. However, on Monday, the teacher had to conduct an extra class for his students who needed additional help. As a result, he ended up using 45% of the chalk, which was 1.5 times more than his usual consumption. He also noticed that the chalk weighed 0.5 ounces, but this didn't affect his usage. Given that the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches and he plans to return to his usual 20% usage per day, how many days does he have before he needs to recycle this piece of chalk?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA math teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk to write equations on a chalkboard for his students.

We then divide this by the daily usage to find out how many days the chalk can be used for.  \n\nAlso, since it is impossible to have a fraction of a day, we should round down the result to the nearest integer.
