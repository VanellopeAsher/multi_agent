Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLeah just got a new kitten. Neutering him cost $150, his 2 vaccines costs $30 each, and the kitten broke 3 vases that cost $15 each. How much has the puppy cost so far?"

Therefore, we'll write a Python program to solve it by adding up all costs for the kitten.\n\n```python\n\n# Costs of neutering, vaccines, and vases\nneutering_cost = 150\nvaccine_cost = 2 * 30\nvases_cost = 3 * 15\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = neutering_cost + vaccine_cost + vases_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\nThe sum of all the expenses will give us the total cost required for the kitten so far. The variables `neutering_cost`, `vaccine_cost` and `vases_cost` represent the cost of neutering, the total cost of the vaccines and the cost of the vases respectively. The `total_cost` variable is the sum of these three costs."

So, the cost for the vases is $15 * 3 = $45.\n\nThe total cost is the sum of all these costs: $150 (neutering) + $60 (vaccines) + $45 (vases) = $255.\n\nSo, after checking the math and the code, the total cost that matches the result. Therefore, the answer is correct. \n\nThe total cost of the kitten so far is \boxed{255} dollars."
