Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

      "content": "First, let's find out the cost per bottle of scotch. Then we'll calculate the cost per bottle of cognac and finally, the total cost by adding the cost of scotch and cognac together.\n\nApproach:\n\n1. The cost per bottle of scotch can be calculated as total_cost_scotch / total_bottles_scotch.\n2. The total bottles of cognac are twice the number of scotch bottles.\n3. The cost per bottle of cognac is 150% of the cost per bottle of scotch.\n4. Then multiply the cost per bottle of cognac by the total number of cognac bottles to get the total cost for cognac.\n\nUsing Python, here's how we can implement it:\n\n```python\ntotal_bottles_scotch = 10\ntotal_cost_scotch = 600\n\n# Calculate cost per bottle of scotch\ncost_per_bottle_scotch = total_cost_scotch / total_bottles_scotch  \n\n# Calculate bottles of cognac\ntotal_bottles_cognac = total_bottles_scotch * 2 \n\n# Calculate cost per bottle of cognac\ncost_per_bottle_cognac = cost_per_bottle_scotch * 1.5  \n\n# Calculate total cost for cognac\ntotal_cost_cognac = cost_per_bottle_cognac * total_bottles_cognac\n\n# Calculate total cost spent on both scotch and cognac\ntotal_cost = total_cost_scotch + total_cost_cognac\n```\n\nSo, run this code and let me know the value of total_cost."

After executing the code, we can see that the total cost spent on scotch and cognac is $2400. \n\nVerification:\n\nLet's go through each step to ensure our calculations are correct:\n\n1. The cost per bottle of scotch was calculated to be $60 (total cost scotch / total bottles scotch = 600 / 10).\n2. The total bottles of cognac were twice the number of scotch bottles, so 20 bottles.\n3. The cost per bottle of cognac was 150% of the cost per bottle of scotch, so $90 (60 * 1.5).\n4. The total cost for cognac was calculated by multiplying the cost per bottle of cognac by the total number of cognac bottles, so $1800 (90 * 20).\n5. Finally, we added the total cost of scotch and the total cost of cognac to get the total cost, hence $2400 (600 + 1800).\n\nSo, the total cost spent on buying the scotch and cognac bottles is $2400. Thus, the final answer is \boxed{2400}."
