Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved directly using Python. Following is the approach:\n\n1. Find out how many eggs Claire eats per day, which is the number of eggs in an omelet.\n2. Find out how many eggs Claire eats per week, which is the number of eggs per day times 7 days in a week.\n3. Find out how many eggs Claire eats in 12 weeks, which is the number of eggs per week times 12.\n4. Finally, convert the total eggs to dozens since eggs are usually purchased by the dozen. There are 12 eggs in one dozen.\n\nNow, I'll implement the steps discussed to solve the problem. \n\n```python\n# Number of eggs in one omelet\neggs_per_omelet = 3\n\n# Number of days in one week\ndays_per_week = 7\n\n# Number of weeks\nweeks = 12\n\n# Calculate total eggs Claire eat in 12 weeks\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_omelet * days_per_week * weeks\n\n# Convert the total eggs to dozens\ntotal_dozen = total_eggs / 12\n\nprint(total_dozen)\n```\n\nOnce we get the result, we can round it off to the nearest whole number if necessary because she cannot buy a fraction of a dozen eggs."

      "content": "The result obtained indicates Claire will need 21 dozens of eggs to make omelettes every morning for 12 weeks.\n\nVERIFICATION\n\n1. We know that Claire eats 3 eggs per day because she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning.\n2. In a week, Claire will eat 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs. \n3. In 12 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 12 weeks = 252 eggs.\n4. One dozen eggs contains 12 eggs. So, 252 eggs / 12 = 21 dozens.\n\nThus, Claire will need 21 dozens of eggs to make her omelettes for 12 weeks which matches the result obtained from the Python program.\n\nHence, the final answer is available in total dozens which is,\n\n\\[boxed{21}\\]"
