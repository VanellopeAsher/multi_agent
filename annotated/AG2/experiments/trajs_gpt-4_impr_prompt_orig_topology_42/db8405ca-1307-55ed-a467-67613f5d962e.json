Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn is a carpenter. For his friend Ali, he manufactured 40 wooden tables for $200 each and 20 roof frames for $100 each. How much does Ali have to pay John?"

      "content": "We can solve this problem using simple mathematical computations. \n\nStep-by-step process:\n\n1. First, we compute the cost of the tables by multiplying the quantity of tables by the price per table.\n2. Next, we compute the cost of the roof frames in the same manner.\n3. Finally, we sum these two costs together to ascertain the total amount Ali has to pay.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of units and the cost per unit\ntables = 40\ntable_cost = 200\nroof_frames = 20\nframe_cost = 100\n\n# Total cost for tables and frames\ntable_total = tables * table_cost\nroof_frame_total = roof_frames * frame_cost\n\n# Total cost Ali has to pay\ntotal_cost = table_total + roof_frame_total\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```"

For the tables: 40 tables were made and each costs $200. Therefore, the total cost for tables is 40 tables * $200/table = $8000.\n2. For the roof frames: 20 roof frames were made and each costs $100. Therefore, the total cost for frames is 20 frames * $100/frame = $2000.\n3. Summing up these totals: $8000 + $2000 = $10,000.\n\nEverything checks out, and your result seems to be correct.\n\nHence, the final answer is:\n\nAli has to pay John $10,000 for the tables and roof frames. Therefore, the total cost is \\$boxed{10,000}."
