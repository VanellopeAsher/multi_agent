For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

Let the number of car tires repaired on Friday be represented by c.\n2. Based on the information, we know that the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. On Thursday, the mechanic earnings were $60 * 6 (for the truck tires) + $40 * 4 (for the car tires), which totals $440. On Friday, the earning were simply $40 * c (since only car tires were repaired).\n3. We can this information to set up the equation: $60 * 6 + $40 * 4 = $40 * c + $40, or 440 = 40c + 40.\n4. Rearrange the equation to find the value of c, which represents the number of car tires repaired on Friday."
