Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Calculate the total number of articles the two websites published together in February if there are 2.8 times of ten days in the month."

      "content": "First, compute the total number of days in February by multiplying 2.8 by 10. Then, find the total number of articles published daily by adding 20 and 10. Multiply these two numbers to get the total number of articles published in February.\n\nLet's proceed with the computation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Total number of days in February\ntotal_days = sp.Rational(2.8*10)\n\n# Total number of articles published daily\ntotal_articles_daily = 20 + 10\n\n# Total number of articles published in February\ntotal_articles = total_days * total_articles_daily\n\ntotal_articles\n```\n\nYou can run the above code block in your Python environment to obtain the solution."

Calculate the total number of days in February: 2.8 * 10 = 28 days which matches with the commonly known length of February, except during leap years.\n2. Calculate the total number of articles published daily: 20 (from the news website) + 10 (from its sister company) = 30 articles per day.\n3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in February: 30 articles/day * 28 days = 840 articles\n\nEverything checks out. So, the total number of articles the two websites posted together in February is \\boxed{840}."
