Since the job took 2.25 hours:\n   - We must round up the labor time to the next whole hour because they charge for each hour or fraction thereof.\n   - Therefore, the chargeable hours would be 3 hours.\n   - The labor fee would be 3 hours * $35 per hour = $105.\n\n3. **Cost of Parts**: The cost of parts for this particular job was $60.\n\n4. **Total Amount Billed**: Add up all the charges:\n   - Service Fee: $40\n   - Labor Fee: $105\n   - Cost of Parts: $60\n\nTotal Amount Billed = Service Fee + Labor Fee + Cost of Parts = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205\n\nHence, the total amount billed to Patty's customer was $205. \n\nNow, let's engage in a discussion with the other agents to verify the solution and explore if there are any alternative considerations."
