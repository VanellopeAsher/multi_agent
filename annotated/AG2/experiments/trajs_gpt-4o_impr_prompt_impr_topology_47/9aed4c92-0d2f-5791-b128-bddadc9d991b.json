That means for each day he works, he adds this amount to his savings.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Needed**: Divide the additional amount needed by the amount Mark earns daily to find the number of days he needs to work to earn that amount.\n   - Days needed = $250 / $12.5 = 20 days.\n\nTherefore, Mark needs to save for 20 days to have enough money to buy the bike."
