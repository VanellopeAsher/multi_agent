      "content": "To calculate the time John spent sightseeing, we'll break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate Time Spent on Each Activity:**\n   - **Boating:** John spends 6 hours boating.\n   - **Swimming:** He swims for half the time he spent boating, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours.\n   - **Watching Shows:** John watches 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours. So, the time he spends watching shows is \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Determine the Total Time Spent on Vacation:**\n   - We know from the problem statement that watching shows constitutes 30% of the total vacation time.\n   - Hence, if we consider the total vacation time as \\( x \\), we can set up the equation for the time spent watching shows as:\n     \\[\n     0.30 \\times x = 6\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total time spent on vacation is 20 hours.\n\n3. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - The activities' total time (boating, swimming, and shows) is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ (boating)} + 3 \\text{ (swimming)} + 6 \\text{ (shows)} = 15 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - The remaining time for sightseeing is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ (total time)} - 15 \\text{ (activities)} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John spent 5 hours sightseeing."

The calculated time John spent sightseeing is 5 hours.\n\n1. **Agent Problem Solver's Approach:**\n   - Total vacation time was calculated by knowing that shows accounted for 30% of the total time, leading to a vacation time of 20 hours.\n   - Subtracting the sum of boating, swimming, and shows' durations from the total gave a sightseeing time of 5 hours.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor's Approach:**\n   - Used Python code to compute the same steps, determining a sightseeing time of 5.0 hours, thus corroborating the solution suggested by Agent Problem Solver.\n\nSince both solutions are in agreement and consistent with the given data, I confirm the solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5}**"
