      "content": "To determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France, let's systematically break down the problem.\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between Flights of the Two Aircraft:**\n   - The second aircraft flies to Poland and operates 44 flights daily. \n   - These 44 flights represent half the total flights made by the first aircraft each day.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Flights of the First Aircraft:**\n   - Let the total number of flights of the first aircraft be \\( x \\).\n   - Since 44 flights represent half of \\( x \\), we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 44 \\times 2 = 88\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the first aircraft operates a total of 88 flights daily.\n\n3. **Determine the Distribution of Flights by the First Aircraft:**\n   - Three-fourths of the flights of the first aircraft go to Greece.\n   - This means the number of flights to Greece is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flights to Greece} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n     \\]\n   - The remaining flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The remaining number of flights is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Flights} = 88 - 66 = 22\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Flights to France:**\n   - The flights to France and Germany are evenly divided, meaning the number of flights to each country is half of the remaining flights:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flights to France} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n     \\]\n\nThus, the first aircraft makes 11 daily flights to France."
