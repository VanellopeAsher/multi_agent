The remaining number of flights is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Flights} = 88 - 66 = 22\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Flights to France:**\n   - The flights to France and Germany are evenly divided, meaning the number of flights to each country is half of the remaining flights:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flights to France} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n     \\]\n\nThus, the first aircraft makes 11 daily flights to France."
