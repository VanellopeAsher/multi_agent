Calculate how many cars are still available for rent after accounting for rented and under-maintenance cars.\n3. Identify the number of available semi-automatic cars.\n4. Calculate the percentage of available semi-automatic cars out of the total available cars.\n\nLet's go through the solution:\n\n1. **Initial Distribution**:\n   - Total cars = 20\n   - Automatic cars = 12\n   - Manual cars = 4\n   - Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4\n\n2. **Cars Currently Not Available**:\n   - Automatic cars rented out = 3\n   - Manual cars under maintenance = 2\n\n3. **Available Cars**:\n   - Remaining automatic cars = 12 - 3 = 9\n   - Remaining manual cars = 4 - 2 = 2\n   - Remaining semi-automatic cars (unchanged since none rented or under maintenance) = 4\n\n4. **Total Available Cars**:\n   - Total available cars = Remaining automatic cars + Remaining manual cars + Remaining semi-automatic cars = 9 + 2 + 4 = 15\n\n5. **Percentage of Available Semi-Automatic Cars**:\n   - Percentage = (Number of available semi-automatic cars / Total available cars) * 100\n   - Percentage = (4 / 15) * 100 â‰ˆ 26.67%\n\nSo, approximately 26.67% of the remaining available cars are semi-automatic."
