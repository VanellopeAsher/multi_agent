To find the number of balloons they used, subtract the remaining balloons from the total number of balloons:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\text{ balloons} - 120 \\text{ balloons left} = 880 \\text{ balloons thrown}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   They threw a total of 880 balloons.\n\nNow, I will discuss this solution with the other agents to ensure its accuracy and completeness."

Then it subtracts the remaining balloons (120) to find how many were thrown.\n\nThe result is:\n```\nballoons_thrown = 880\n```\n\nMy code confirms that 880 balloons were thrown during the water balloon fight.
