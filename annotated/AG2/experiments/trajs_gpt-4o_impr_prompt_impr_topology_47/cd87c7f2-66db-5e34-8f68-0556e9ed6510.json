To find the number of balloons they used, subtract the remaining balloons from the total number of balloons:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\text{ balloons} - 120 \\text{ balloons left} = 880 \\text{ balloons thrown}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   They threw a total of 880 balloons.\n\nNow, I will discuss this solution with the other agents to ensure its accuracy and completeness."
