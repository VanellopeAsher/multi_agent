The problem statement should include additional information about Lynn's relationship to Paisley and Reggie's distances if we are to determine how far Lynn ran.\n\nI will now engage in discussion with the other agents to see if they have any insights or additional interpretations."

Given the provided information, it seems impossible to mathematically deduce Lynn's running distance without further assumptions or relations. Let's collaborate and discuss if there's an implied or overlooked detail that might have been missed:\n\n1. **Reassess the Problem Context**: Sometimes, problems may require assumptions such as them having run together completely, or covering the same total distance, etc. However, nothing in the problem statement directly alludes to such shared details.\n\n2. **Clarification**: If it's a problem from a textbook or assignment, often there's additional context or shared information earlier in the text which might provide details about shared running patterns or comparative distances.\n\n3. **Discuss any Typical Assumptions**: In some cases, solving the problem involves understanding or agreeing on hidden assumptions that would align with typical logic or common problem-solving standards.\n\nLet's confer with each other and with the question provider to clarify this. If no further context is available, we may have to ask if there's additional information or if assumptions should be made."
