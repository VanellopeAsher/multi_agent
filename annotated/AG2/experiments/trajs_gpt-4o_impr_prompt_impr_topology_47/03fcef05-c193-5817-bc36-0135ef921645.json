Therefore, the new total amount before spending is calculated by adding the savings to the initial amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total before spending} = \\text{Initial Amount} + \\text{Savings} = 2100 + 1100 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expenditures**:\n   - He spends $500 on a comic book.\n   - He spends $1900 on a puzzle.\n\n4. **Total Spending**: The total amount spent is the sum of the expenditures on the comic book and the puzzle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Spent} = 500 + 1900 = 2400\n   \\]\n\n5. **Remaining Amount**: The remaining amount of money Raymond has is obtained by subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount before spending:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money Left} = \\text{Total before spending} - \\text{Total Spent} = 3200 - 2400 = 800\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Raymond has $800 left. \n\nLet's discuss this solution with the other agents."
