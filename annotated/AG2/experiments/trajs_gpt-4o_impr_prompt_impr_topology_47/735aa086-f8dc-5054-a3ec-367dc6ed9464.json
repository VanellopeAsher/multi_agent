Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

Then, we'll divide by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Weight for Each Type of Feed**:\n   - **Sugar cubes**: The farmer buys 20 boxes, each weighing 10 pounds. \n     \\[\n     20 \\times 10 = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Carrots**: The farmer buys 40 bags, each weighing 120 pounds.\n     \\[\n     40 \\times 120 = 4800 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Hay**: The farmer buys 420 bales, each weighing 750 pounds.\n     \\[\n     420 \\times 750 = 315000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Oats**: The farmer buys 200 sacks, each weighing 650 pounds.\n     \\[\n     200 \\times 650 = 130000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Weight of All Feed**:\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ (sugar cubes)} + 4800 \\text{ (carrots)} + 315000 \\text{ (hay)} + 130000 \\text{ (oats)} = 450000 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Trips Required**:\n   - The truck can carry 22500 pounds per trip. To find the number of trips, divide the total weight by the carrying capacity of the truck.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{450000}{22500} = 20 \\text{ trips}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to make 20 trips to transport all the feed. \n\nDiscussion with others is welcome to ensure accuracy and completeness."
