Jackson plants 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.\n2. Jackson buys 30 yellow tulips, allowing him to plant 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n\nThe original solution had miscalculated the placement of yellow rows. The correct placement of yellow rows is between each red and blue row as additional ones, but since Jackson uses all his yellow tulips to create 6 separate rows, the previous interpretation stands that he adds to the count of non-yellow rows, resulting in a yet consistent total but affirming design.\n\nTherefore, the total number of rows Jackson will actually plant is just the sum of red, blue, and yellow rows, without adding them as separators since the totality was used exclusively, equaling 15 rows.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{15}**"
