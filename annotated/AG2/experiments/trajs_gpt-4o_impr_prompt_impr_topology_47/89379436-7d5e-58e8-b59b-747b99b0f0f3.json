However, the shark's body length is not provided in the prompt, which is essential to calculate this percentage. For this problem, I will proceed with the assumption that `S` is the length of the shark in inches.\n\nHere’s a step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. **Identify the Lengths:**\n   - Each remora is 6 inches long.\n   - There are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the Combined Length in Terms of Percentage:**\n   - To find this, we need the formula: \\[\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Combined Length of Remoras}}{\\text{Length of Shark}}\\right) \\times 100\\]\n\n3. **Plug in the Values and Assume the Shark’s Length:**\n   - Let’s denote the shark's length as \\( S \\) inches.\n   - Substitute into the formula: \\[\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{12}{S}\\right) \\times 100\\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The percentage of the shark’s body length that the remoras contribute is \\(\\left(\\frac{12}{S}\\right) \\times 100\\%\\).\n\nPlease provide the shark's length if known, or we can consider hypothetical lengths to illustrate this concept further."
