Therefore, the number of smart TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10 \\).\n\n2. **Fraction of Analog TVs:** One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs. Therefore, the number of analog TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times 40 = 5 \\).\n\n3. **Fraction of Projection TVs:** One-fifth of the sales are projection TVs. Therefore, the number of projection TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 40 = 8 \\).\n\n4. **Total TVs Sold:** We subtract the number of smart, analog, and projection TVs sold from the total number of 40 TVs, to find the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of OLED TVs sold} = 40 - (10 + 5 + 8)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of OLED TVs sold} = 40 - 23 = 17\n   \\]\n\nThus, Samwell was able to sell 17 OLED TVs."
