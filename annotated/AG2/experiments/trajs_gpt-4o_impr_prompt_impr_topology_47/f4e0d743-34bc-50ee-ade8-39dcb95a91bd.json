      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total annual expenses Madeline incurs for her dog's needs. We can break down the costs into monthly and bimonthly expenses and then sum these to obtain the annual total.\n\n1. **Food Costs**:  \n   - Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\$25 \\, \\text{(per week)} \\times 4 \\, \\text{(weeks per month)} = \\$100 \\, \\text{per month}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the annual food cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\$100 \\, \\text{(per month)} \\times 12 \\, \\text{(months per year)} = \\$1200 \\, \\text{per year}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Treats Costs**:  \n   - The treats cost $20 per month. Thus, the annual treats cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\$20 \\, \\text{(per month)} \\times 12 \\, \\text{(months per year)} = \\$240 \\, \\text{per year}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Medicine Costs**:  \n   - Medicine costs $100 per month. Thus, the annual medicine cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\$100 \\, \\text{(per month)} \\times 12 \\, \\text{(months per year)} = \\$1200 \\, \\text{per year}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Special Shampoo Costs**:  \n   - The special shampoo costs $15 per month. Therefore, the annual shampoo cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\$15 \\, \\text{(per month)} \\times 12 \\, \\text{(months per year)} = \\$180 \\, \\text{per year}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Toy Costs**:  \n   - The toy costs $10 every two months. This implies Madeline buys 6 toys per year since there are 12 months in a year:\n     \\[\n     \\$10 \\, \\text{(per toy)} \\times 6 \\, \\text{(toys per year)} = \\$60 \\, \\text{per year}\n     \\]\n\nFinally, sum all these expenses to determine the total annual cost:  \n\\[\n\\$1200 \\, \\text{(food)} + \\$240 \\, \\text{(treats)} + \\$1200 \\, \\text{(medicine)} + \\$180 \\, \\text{(shampoo)} + \\$60 \\, \\text{(toys)} = \\$2880 \\, \\text{per year}\n\\]\n\nMadeline spends a total of $2880 per year on her dog."
