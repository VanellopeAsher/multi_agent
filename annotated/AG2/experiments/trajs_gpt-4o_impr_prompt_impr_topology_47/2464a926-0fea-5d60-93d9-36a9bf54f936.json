Therefore, the total number of balloons initially is calculated as follows:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Balloons} = 10 \\times 30 = 300\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Remaining Balloons:**\n   At the end of the water balloon fight, there are 12 balloons left.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Balloons Used:**\n   To find the number of balloons used during the water balloon fight, subtract the number of remaining balloons from the total number of balloons prepared:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Used} = \\text{Total Balloons} - \\text{Remaining Balloons} = 300 - 12 = 288\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of balloons used in the water balloon fight is 288. \n\nIs there anything else to discuss or clarify regarding this solution?"
