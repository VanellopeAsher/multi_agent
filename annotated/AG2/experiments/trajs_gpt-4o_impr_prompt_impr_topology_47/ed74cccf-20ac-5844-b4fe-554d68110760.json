      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to systematically account for the number of students in each sport and then sum up these amounts to get the total number of distinct students participating.\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Students in Each Sport:**\n   - **Tennis:** We are given that there are 6 students playing tennis.\n   - **Volleyball:** We know that the number of students playing volleyball is twice that of the students playing tennis. Since there are 6 students playing tennis, the number of students playing volleyball is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\).\n   - **Soccer:** We are informed that there are 22 girls playing soccer. The problem statement doesn't specify the number of boys, but we'll deduce that in the next step.\n\n2. **Express the Total Students in Soccer:**\n   - The number of students playing soccer includes both boys and girls. However, we only have the count for girls, and we need additional information (perhaps from other context or data) to determine the number of boys. For now, let's denote the number of boys playing soccer as \\( b \\). Therefore, the total number of students playing soccer is \\( 22 + b \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Students Across All Sports:**\n   - The total number of students considering all categories listed will be the sum of the participants in each sport:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Students} = (\\text{Students in Tennis}) + (\\text{Students in Volleyball}) + (\\text{Students in Soccer})\n   \\]\n   - Substituting the known values, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Students} = 6 + 12 + (22 + b)\n   \\]\n   - Simplifying this, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Students} = 40 + b\n   \\]\n\nGiven the problem asks for the total number of students but doesn't specify the exact count of boys in soccer, unless we can deduce or assume \\( b \\), the number will remain as \\( 40 + b \\). If further information or assumptions were allowed, we could provide a definitive number."

However, based on the information provided, we can't deduce \\( b \\) without additional details. Therefore, the solution remains:\n\n33 students participate in sports. Of these, 6 play tennis, 12 play volleyball, and 22 girls play soccer. The total number of students is \\(40 + b\\), where \\(b\\) is the number of boys playing soccer. \n\nSince the problem doesnâ€™t provide the exact number of boys involved in soccer, we would need additional context or assumptions to find \\( b \\). Hence, the total number of distinct students will be 40 + \\( b \\)."

Given the lack of additional specifics to resolve \\( b \\), the final solution based on the explicitly given information is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{40 + b}**"
