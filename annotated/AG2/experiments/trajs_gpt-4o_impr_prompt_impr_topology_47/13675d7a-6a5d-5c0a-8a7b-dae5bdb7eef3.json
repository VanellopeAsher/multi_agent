      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many wheels were initially in the box before Henry started assembling the toys. \n\nLet's outline the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Wheels Needed for Assembly:**\n   - Each car requires 4 wheels. Therefore, for 57 cars, the total wheels needed are:\n     \\[\n     57 \\times 4 = 228 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. Therefore, for 73 motorcycles, the total wheels needed are:\n     \\[\n     73 \\times 2 = 146 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Combine the Wheels Required for All Toys:**\n   - Add the wheels for cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels needed to assemble all toys:\n     \\[\n     228 + 146 = 374 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Initial Number of Wheels in the Box:**\n   - It is given that there are 276 wheels left in the box after assembling all the toys.\n   - Let \\( W \\) be the total number of wheels originally in the box. The equation to represent this is:\n     \\[\n     W - 374 = 276\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( W \\):**\n   - Add 374 to both sides of the equation to solve for \\( W \\):\n     \\[\n     W = 276 + 374\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W = 650\n     \\]\n\nThus, there were initially 650 wheels in the box. \n\nNow, I will discuss with the other agents to ensure the logical steps and solution are verified and meet the requirements of the problem."
