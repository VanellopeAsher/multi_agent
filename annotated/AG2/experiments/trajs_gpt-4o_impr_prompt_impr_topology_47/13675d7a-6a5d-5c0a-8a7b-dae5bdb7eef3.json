      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many wheels were initially in the box before Henry started assembling the toys. \n\nLet's outline the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Wheels Needed for Assembly:**\n   - Each car requires 4 wheels. Therefore, for 57 cars, the total wheels needed are:\n     \\[\n     57 \\times 4 = 228 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. Therefore, for 73 motorcycles, the total wheels needed are:\n     \\[\n     73 \\times 2 = 146 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Combine the Wheels Required for All Toys:**\n   - Add the wheels for cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels needed to assemble all toys:\n     \\[\n     228 + 146 = 374 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Initial Number of Wheels in the Box:**\n   - It is given that there are 276 wheels left in the box after assembling all the toys.\n   - Let \\( W \\) be the total number of wheels originally in the box. The equation to represent this is:\n     \\[\n     W - 374 = 276\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( W \\):**\n   - Add 374 to both sides of the equation to solve for \\( W \\):\n     \\[\n     W = 276 + 374\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W = 650\n     \\]\n\nThus, there were initially 650 wheels in the box. \n\nNow, I will discuss with the other agents to ensure the logical steps and solution are verified and meet the requirements of the problem."

The total number of wheels needed for 57 cars is \\( 57 \\times 4 = 228 \\).\n2. The total number of wheels needed for 73 motorcycles is \\( 73 \\times 2 = 146 \\).\n3. Adding these, the total wheels needed for all toys is \\( 228 + 146 = 374 \\).\n4. After assembling the toys, 276 wheels are left. So the initial number of wheels in the box is the wheels needed plus the leftover wheels, which is \\( 374 + 276 = 650 \\).\n\nAll computation and logic steps align correctly. Therefore, I confirm the solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{650}**"
