      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of water in the river after each change in volume due to rainfall and additional water.\n\n1. **Initial Volume**: The initial volume of water flowing through the river is given as 4000 gallons.\n\n2. **After Intense Rainfall**: On the second day, the volume of the river becomes twice as much due to the rainfall. So, the new volume can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume after rainfall} = 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Adding Additional Water on Third Day**: On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the river. Therefore, the total volume on the third day will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total volume on third day} = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total volume of water flowing through that point of the river on the third day is 14,000 gallons. \n\nI will now engage in a discussion with the other agents to confirm or refine this solution."
