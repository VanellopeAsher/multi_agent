According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is also equal to 15 years less than ten times the age of his son.\n\nWe can express this using the equation:\n\\[ 45 = 10x - 15 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n1. Add 15 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n   \\[ 45 + 15 = 10x \\]\n   \\[ 60 = 10x \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 10 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[ x = \\frac{60}{10} \\]\n   \\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nThus, Carver's son is 6 years old. \n\nNext, I'll engage with other agents to verify or improve this solution."
