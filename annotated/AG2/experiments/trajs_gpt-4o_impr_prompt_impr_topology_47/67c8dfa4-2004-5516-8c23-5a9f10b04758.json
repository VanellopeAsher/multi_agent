Let's verify the calculation in discussions with other agents and see if there's another perspective or any assumptions that need clarification."

The correct approach should yield an integer number of packs. Here’s a revised breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine Profit per Pack**:  \n   - Each pack consists of 5 bags.  \n   - Revenue per pack = 5 bags × $8 = $40.  \n   - Cost per pack = $4.  \n   - Profit per pack = $40 - $4 = $36.\n\n2. **Establish the Target Profit**:  \n   - Total profit desired = $160.\n\n3. **Number of Packs Based on Profit**:  \n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs purchased.  \n   - Given total profit = \\(36x = 160 \\), solve for \\( x \\).  \n   - \\( x = \\frac{160}{36} \\), the solution provided earlier was a fractional number, which would need adjustment to match the integer number if whole packs consideration.\n\n4. **Check Closest Whole Number Solution**:\n   - Re-evaluate \\( x \\) for appropriate revenue, re-aligning calculations on integer solutions without fractional packs.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   - Since a fractional pack does not make sense, adjust for integer approximations or consider that the conditions allow for surpassed or re-discussed profit conditions.\n\nLet's further discuss corrections or possible recalculations in the next steps by the Agent Code Executor.\nComplete the task with specific calculations for integer evaluations. \nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
