I will calculate it using Python.\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of each item\nfish_tank_cost = 10.00\nstone_packet_cost = 2.50 * 2\ncoral_piece_cost = 2.00 * 3\nfish_cost = 0.50 * 20\nfish_food_cost = 2.00\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = fish_tank_cost + stone_packet_cost + coral_piece_cost + fish_cost + fish_food_cost\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
