Colby has 80 quarters.\n     \\[\n     80 \\, \\text{quarters} \\times 25 \\, \\text{cents per quarter} = 2000 \\, \\text{cents}\n     \\]\n   - Dimes: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 60 dimes.\n     \\[\n     60 \\, \\text{dimes} \\times 10 \\, \\text{cents per dime} = 600 \\, \\text{cents}\n     \\]\n   - Nickels: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 140 nickels.\n     \\[\n     140 \\, \\text{nickels} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cents per nickel} = 700 \\, \\text{cents}\n     \\]\n   - Pennies: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 150 pennies.\n     \\[\n     150 \\, \\text{pennies} \\times 1 \\, \\text{cent per penny} = 150 \\, \\text{cents}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Money in Cents**:\n   \\[\n   2000 \\, \\text{cents (quarters)} + 600 \\, \\text{cents (dimes)} + 700 \\, \\text{cents (nickels)} + 150 \\, \\text{cents (pennies)} = 3450 \\, \\text{cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Number of Gumballs**:\n   - Each gumball costs 5 cents (equivalent to a nickel).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3450 \\, \\text{cents}}{5 \\, \\text{cents per gumball}} = 690 \\, \\text{gumballs}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Colby can buy 690 gumballs. \n\nNow let's discuss this approach with the other agents to ensure there are no errors or alternative methods they might suggest."
