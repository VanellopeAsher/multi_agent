Normal sudoku time as 30 minutes.\n2. Extreme sudoku takes 90 minutes (3 times the normal sudoku time).\n3. Total time is 120 minutes.\n4. John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes. Therefore, for 120 minutes, he drinks 4 bottles.\n\nThe output of this code would be 4, which matches the solution provided.\n\nThus, the correct number of bottles of water John drinks is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{4}**"
