      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down systematically:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Implants**:\n   - The base price of each implant is $2000.5.\n   - Since George needs 2 implants, the base cost for both implants is \\( 2 \\times 2000.5 \\).\n\n2. **Add the Cost of the Porcelain Crown**:\n   - The porcelain crown costs an additional $500.5, and it's for one implant only.\n   - So, the total cost is the sum of the base costs for both implants plus the porcelain crown.\n\n3. **Determine the Remaining Balance After the Deposit**:\n   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.\n   - Subtract this deposit from the total cost to find out how much more money he needs to pay.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Hours George Needs to Work**:\n   - Divide the outstanding balance by George's hourly wage.\n   - George makes $15.3 per hour, so divide the remaining amount by $15.3 to find the number of hours he needs to work.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- Total cost for 2 implants: \\( 2 \\times 2000.5 = 4001.0 \\).\n- Add the porcelain crown cost: \\( 4001.0 + 500.5 = 4501.5 \\).\n- Subtract the deposit: \\( 4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5 \\).\n\nFinally, calculate the hours needed:\n\n- Remaining balance: $3901.5.\n- Hourly wage: $15.3.\n- Hours needed: \\( 3901.5 \\div 15.3 \\approx 254.31 \\).\n\nTherefore, George needs to work approximately 254.31 hours to pay for the dental work.\n\nNext step is to discuss this solution and confirm calculations with the other agents."
