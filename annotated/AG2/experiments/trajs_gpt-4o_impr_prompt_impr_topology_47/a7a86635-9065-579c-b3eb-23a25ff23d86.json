      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of seashells brought back by each girl. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine the number of boys**: Since the group was divided into two equal parts of boys and girls from the 200 kids, the number of boys is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of shells brought by the boys**: Each boy brought back 600 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought by all the boys is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells by boys} = 100 \\times 600 = 60,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of girls**: Since the group was evenly divided, the number of girls is the same as the number of boys:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the total number of shells brought by the girls**: According to the problem, the amount brought by the girls is equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells by girls} = 60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl**: Finally, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shells per girl} = \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, each girl brought back 3,000 seashells."
