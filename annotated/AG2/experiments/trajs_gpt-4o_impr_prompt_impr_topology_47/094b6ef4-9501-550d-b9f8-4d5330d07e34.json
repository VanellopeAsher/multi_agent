Each remora is 6 inches long.\n3. The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Length of the Remoras:**\n   Since there are two remoras and each one is 6 inches long, the total length of the remoras is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express the Total Length of the Remoras as a Percentage of the Shark's Length:**\n   According to the problem, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. Let \\( S \\) be the length of the shark. Then:\n   \\[\n   0.1 \\times S = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the Shark's Length ( \\( S \\) ):**\n   Rearranging the equation to solve for \\( S \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{12}{0.1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = 120 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the shark is 120 inches.
