That equals \\(3 \\times 0.5\\) hours = 1.5 hours.\n- **Thursday**: An hour episode and a 30-minute show. So, 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n- **Friday**: Two one-hour episodes. That equals \\(2 \\times 1\\) hour = 2 hours.\n\nNow, we just add up the hours from each day:\n\n\\[ 1 \\, (\\text{Monday}) + 1 \\, (\\text{Tuesday}) + 1.5 \\, (\\text{Wednesday}) + 1.5 \\, (\\text{Thursday}) + 2 \\, (\\text{Friday}) \\]\n\nThat results in:\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV over the week."
