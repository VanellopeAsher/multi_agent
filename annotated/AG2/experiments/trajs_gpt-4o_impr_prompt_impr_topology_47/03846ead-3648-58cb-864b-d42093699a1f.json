Letâ€™s do this step by step:\n\n1. **Alex's Points**:\n   - Alex has collected 60 points.\n\n2. **Bella's Points**:\n   - Bella has collected 30% more points than Alex.\n   - So, Bella's points = Alex's points + 30% of Alex's points = 60 + 0.30 * 60 = 60 + 18 = 78 points.\n\n3. **Tim's Points**:\n   - Tim collected 40 points less than Bella.\n   - So, Tim's points = Bella's points - 40 = 78 - 40 = 38 points.\n\n4. **Mary's Points**:\n   - Mary collected 3 times more points than Tim.\n   - So, Mary's points = 3 * Tim's points = 3 * 38 = 114 points.\n\n5. **Total Points Collected by the Class**:\n   - Total = Alex's points + Bella's points + Tim's points + Mary's points\n   - Total = 60 + 78 + 38 + 114 = 290 points.\n\n6. **Points Needed for the Field Trip**:\n   - Minimum threshold = 500 points.\n   - Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points collected = 500 - 290 = 210 points.\n\nTherefore, the class is missing 210 points to go on the field trip. \n\nLet's discuss this solution and verify if there are any discrepancies or alternative approaches."
