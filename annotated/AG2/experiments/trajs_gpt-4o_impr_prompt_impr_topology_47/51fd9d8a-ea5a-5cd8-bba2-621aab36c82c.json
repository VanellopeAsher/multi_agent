      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Combined Age**:  \n   The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 0.1 times one thousand years old, which equates to 100 years.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationships**: \n   - Let \\( J \\) represent John's age.\n   - Paul is 0.1 times one hundred years older than John. So, Paul's age, \\( P_a \\), can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     P_a = J + 0.1 \\times 100 = J + 10\n     \\]\n   - Peter's age, \\( P_e \\), is the sum of Paul's and John's ages, thus:\n     \\[\n     P_e = P_a + J = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10\n     \\]\n\n3. **Setting Up the Total Age Equation**:  \n   The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is given by the equation:\n   \\[\n   P_e + P_a + J = 100\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expressions for \\( P_e \\) and \\( P_a \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify and Solve for John's Age `J`**:  \n   Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   4J + 20 = 100\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( J \\) involves:\n   \\[\n   4J = 80 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad J = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find Paul's and Peter's Ages**:\n   - Calculate Paul's age:\n     \\[\n     P_a = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30\n     \\]\n   - Calculate Peter's age:\n     \\[\n     P_e = 2J + 10 = 2 \\times 20 + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Peter's age is 50 years. \n\nLet's discuss this with other agents to ensure all steps and calculations are correct."
