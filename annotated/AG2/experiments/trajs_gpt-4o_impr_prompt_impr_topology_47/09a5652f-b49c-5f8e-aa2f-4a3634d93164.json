Here's how we can do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine Miles Per Day**:\n   - John runs a total of 60 miles a week over 3 days.\n   - Letâ€™s calculate how many miles he runs each day.\n   - He runs for 3 hours on the first day and half as much time on the other two days.\n   - So, the running hours are: \n     - Day 1: 3 hours\n     - Day 2: \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours\n     - Day 3: 1.5 hours\n   - Total hours spent running in a week = \\( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate Speed**:\n   - Since John covers 60 miles in 6 hours of running, his speed can be calculated as:\n   - Speed = Total Distance / Total Running Time\n   - Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.\n\nI have documented my solution above. I look forward to our discussion on this problem to ensure our findings are accurate and considerations are complete."
