      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**  \n   Marty needs to cut a ribbon into parts. First, the ribbon is to be divided into 4 equal parts. Then each of those 4 parts is further divided into 5 equal parts.\n\n2. **Initial Ribbon Division:**  \n   Let's denote the total length of the ribbon as \\( L \\). When the ribbon is first cut into 4 equal parts, each part will have a length of:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{L}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Further Division of Each Part:**  \n   Each of the 4 equal parts needs to be divided into 5 smaller equal parts. Therefore, the length of each smaller part will be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\left(\\frac{L}{4}\\right) = \\frac{L}{4 \\times 5} = \\frac{L}{20}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Result:**  \n   After both sets of cuts, each of the final small parts will be \\(\\frac{L}{20}\\).\n\nThus, each final cut will be of length \\(\\frac{L}{20}\\), where \\( L \\) is the original length of the ribbon."
