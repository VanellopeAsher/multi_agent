Thus, it contains:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 500 = 1500 \\, \\text{pieces}\n     \\]\n   - The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces in the first box. Hence, it contains:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125 \\, \\text{pieces}\n     \\]\n   - The fourth box has 125 more pieces than the first box. Therefore, it has:\n     \\[\n     500 + 125 = 625 \\, \\text{pieces}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pieces Johnny picks up:**\n   - By adding all the pieces from the four boxes, we get:\n     \\[\n     500 + 1500 + 125 + 625 = 2750 \\, \\text{pieces}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Johnny picks up a total of 2750 Lego pieces.\n\nWe can now discuss this solution with other agents if needed."
