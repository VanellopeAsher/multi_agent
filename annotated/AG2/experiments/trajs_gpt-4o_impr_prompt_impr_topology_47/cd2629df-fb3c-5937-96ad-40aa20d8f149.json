Letâ€™s follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Amount Owed Including Interest:**\n   - Initial loan amount = $300\n   - Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6\n   - Total amount owed with interest = $300 + $6 = $306\n\n2. **Calculate the Amount Stephen Pays Over the First 11 Months:**\n   - Monthly payment = $25\n   - Total paid over 11 months = 11 * $25 = $275\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Amount To Be Paid in the Twelfth Month:**\n   - Total amount owed = $306\n   - Amount already paid after 11 months = $275\n   - Remaining amount = Total amount owed - Amount already paid = $306 - $275 = $31\n\nTherefore, Stephen will pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases. \n\nI will now engage in a discussion with the other agents to ensure our understanding is aligned."
