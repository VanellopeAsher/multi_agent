      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the individual costs of both the gallon jars and half-gallon jars, and then calculate the total expenditure for the number of jars mentioned.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Cost of Each Jar:**\n\n   - We know that a gallon jar costs \\( \\$5.5 \\).\n   - We also know that a gallon jar costs \\( \\$2.5 \\) more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the equation for the price of the half-gallon jar \\( x \\) is:\n     \\[\n     x + 2.5 = 5.5\n     \\]\n\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 5.5 - 2.5 = 3\n     \\]\n   - Hence, the cost of a half-gallon jar is \\( \\$3.0 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Expenditure:**\n\n   - Cecelia bought 10-gallon jars. The cost for the gallon jars is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 5.5 = 55\n     \\]\n   \n   - She also purchased 16 half-gallon jars. The cost for the half-gallon jars is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\times 3 = 48\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Cost:**\n\n   - Add the costs of both types of jars together to get the total expenditure:\n     \\[\n     55 + 48 = 103\n     \\]\n\nSo, Cecelia spent a total of \\( \\$103.0 \\) on the jars.\n\nI have laid out the solution. I would now like to discuss this approach with Agent Code Executor to affirm my methodology and ensure that all steps are logically sound."
