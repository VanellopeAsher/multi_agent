Otherwise, we can't compute how many inches of ribbon Monica can allocate per gift.\n\nAssuming no total ribbon length is mentioned, we would need more information to provide a final answer. Once that data is given, the solution would involve simply dividing the total ribbon length by 12 (the count of gifts) to find out the inches of ribbon per gift bow.\n\nIf there's any additional detail or assumption to make, like the ribbon amount or bow size preferences, it should be included to refine the solution further. Let’s wait for more input or assumptions, or else we’ll involve Agent Code Executor if this were a programmable problem involving calculations."

If there's an assumed total length or any related instruction, please specify that so we can finalize the solution.
