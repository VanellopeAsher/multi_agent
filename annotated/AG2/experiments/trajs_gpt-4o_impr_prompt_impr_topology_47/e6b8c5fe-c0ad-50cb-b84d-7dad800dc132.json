For calculation purposes, let's assume a gumball costs $0.25 each (this is a common price in many scenarios involving gumballs). \n\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of gumballs Colby can buy} = \\frac{\\$3.45}{\\$0.25} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n= 13.8 \n\\]\n\nBecause Colby cannot purchase a fraction of a gumball, the maximum number of whole gumballs he can buy is 13.\n\nTherefore, Colby can buy **13 gumballs**."
