Here's a step-by-step recap in code form for verification:\n\nWe'll write a small piece of code that reflects the logic already explained:\n\n```python\n# Joanne's apples\ntallest_joanne = 30\nshortest_joanne = tallest_joanne / 2  # That's 15\naverage_joanne = 350\ntotal_joanne = tallest_joanne + shortest_joanne + average_joanne  \n\n# Sister's apples\ntallest_sister = 2 * tallest_joanne  # That's 60\n# Total apples they gathered together\ntotal_apples = 500\n\n# Calculating how many apples sister gathered from the shortest trees\nshortest_sister = total_apples - (total_joanne + tallest_sister)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of sister's to Joanne's apples from shortest trees\nratio = shortest_sister / shortest_joanne\n\nshortest_sister, ratio\n```\n\nUpon executing this, the code yields the following results:\n\n- Sister gathered 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n- The ratio of apples gathered by Joanne's sister concerning Joanne is 3.\n\nTherefore, these results agree with the solution provided by the Agent Problem Solver: \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3}**"
