Therefore, the total cost for \\( x \\) guests can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost at First Venue} = 2000 + 50x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Venue**: This venue charges $250 per guest, which includes food. Therefore, the cost for \\( x \\) guests is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost at Second Venue} = 250x\n   \\]\n\nTo find the number of guests at which both venues cost the same, we simply equalize the two equations:\n\\[\n2000 + 50x = 250x\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n2000 = 250x - 50x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2000 = 200x\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2000}{200}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, Mark will need 10 guests for the costs of the two venues to be equal. \n\nNow, I'll join the discussion with the other agents to verify and discuss the approach."
