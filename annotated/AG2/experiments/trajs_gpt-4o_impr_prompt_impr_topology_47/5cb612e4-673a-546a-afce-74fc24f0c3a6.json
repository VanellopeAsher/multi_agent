      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bags of wheat the trader sold, given the purchase and selling prices, transportation costs, and total profit.\n\nHereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( n \\) be the number of bags the trader sold.\n   - Purchase cost per bag = $20\n   - Selling price per bag = $30\n   - Transportation cost per bag = $2\n   - Total profit = $400\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost**:\n   - The total cost includes both the purchase price and transportation cost.\n   - So, the total cost per bag is: \\( 20 + 2 = 22 \\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for \\( n \\) bags is \\( 22n \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Revenue**:\n   - The revenue from selling the bags is simply the selling price per bag times the number of bags.\n   - Therefore, total revenue is \\( 30n \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Use Profit Equation**:\n   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs.\n   - The trader's profit is given by the equation:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost}\n     \\]\n\n   - Substituting the known values:\n\n     \\[\n     400 = 30n - 22n\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( n \\)**:\n   - Simplify the equation:\n\n     \\[\n     400 = 8n\n     \\]\n\n   - Dividing both sides by 8 gives:\n\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{400}{8} = 50\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
