The fourth child is 72 inches tall.\n2. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.\n3. The third child is five inches shorter than the second child.\n4. The second child is two inches taller than the first child.\n\nLet's denote the height of the first child as \\( x \\) feet. We need to convert inches into feet when calculating the final height of the first child in feet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine Third Child's Height**:\n   - Since the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, the third child is \\( 72 - 3 = 69 \\) inches tall.\n\n2. **Determine Second Child's Height**:\n   - The third child is five inches shorter than the second child, so the second child is \\( 69 + 5 = 74 \\) inches tall.\n\n3. **Determine First Child's Height**:\n   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the first child is \\( 74 - 2 = 72 \\) inches tall.\n\n4. **Convert First Child's Height to Feet**:\n   - Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, convert 72 inches to feet: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Height in feet} = \\frac{72}{12} = 6 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the first child is 6 feet tall.
