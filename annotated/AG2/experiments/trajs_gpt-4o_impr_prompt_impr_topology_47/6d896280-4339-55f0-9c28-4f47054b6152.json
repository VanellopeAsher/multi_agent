Therefore, we can write the equation as:  \n   \\[\n   x + x + 2x = 500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**:  \n   Simplify the equation by combining like terms:  \n   \\[\n   4x = 500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:  \n   Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday is 125. \n\nNow, let's discuss and confirm this solution with the team."
