      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the highest number of Karate classes Manny can miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10.\n\nHereâ€™s the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Data:**\n   - Total cost for Karate classes = $60\n   - Total number of Karate classes = 10\n   - Maximum acceptable cost per class = $10\n\n2. **Determine the Total Acceptable Cost:**\n   If the cost per class should not exceed $10, for 10 classes, the total acceptable expenditure is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ classes} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/class} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n   Thankfully, since the total cost is $60, this has not been exceeded, so we will now examine how many classes can be safely missed.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost per Class Based on Classes Attended:**\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of classes Manny attends. Then, the cost per attended class is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per class} = \\frac{60}{x} \n   \\]\n   We need to ensure this does not exceed $10:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   60 \\leq 10x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Number of Classes He Can Miss:**\n   Since \\( x \\) is the number of classes attended and it must be at least 6, Manny can miss:\n   \\[\n   10 - 6 = 4 \\text{ classes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes before his parents decided not to sign him up again due to the cost exceeding the allowed $10 per class. \n\nWould anyone like to discuss this further or have additional insights?"
