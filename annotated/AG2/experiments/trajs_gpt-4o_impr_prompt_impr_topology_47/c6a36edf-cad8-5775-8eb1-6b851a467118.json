      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll go through the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Crayon Fragments**: \n   Kate received 3 containers, with each container containing 64 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayon fragments is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fragments} = 3 \\times 64 = 192\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Crayon Muffins**: \n   Each crayon muffin is made from 8 crayon fragments. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of crayon fragments by 8 to find out how many crayon muffins can be made:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of muffins} = \\frac{192}{8} = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Earnings**: \n   Kate can sell each crayon muffin for $1.50. To find the total amount of money she can earn, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total earnings} = 24 \\times 1.50 = 36.00\n   \\]\n\nThus, Kate can earn a total of $36.00 by selling her crayon muffins."
