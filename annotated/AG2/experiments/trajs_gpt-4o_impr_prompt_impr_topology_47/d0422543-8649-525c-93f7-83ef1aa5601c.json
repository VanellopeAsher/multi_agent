According to the problem, Carver is 60 years old, and this is 8 years less than twice the age of his son.\n\nWe can frame this as an equation using the information given:\n\\[ 2x - 8 = 60 \\]\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start with the equation:\n   \\[\n   2x - 8 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 8 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving \\( x \\) on one side:\n   \\[\n   2x = 60 + 8\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   2x = 68\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{68}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify to find the value of \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 34\n   \\]\n\nSo, Carver's son is 34 years old.\n\nLet's proceed to discuss this solution."
