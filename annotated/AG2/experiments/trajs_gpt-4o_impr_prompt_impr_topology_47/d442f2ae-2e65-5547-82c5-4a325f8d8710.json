First, calculate the total cost for the goats:\n   - John buys 3 goats, each costing $500.\n   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1,500\n\n2. Next, calculate the total cost for the cows:\n   - John buys 2 cows, each costing $1500.\n   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3,000\n\n3. Add the costs of the goats and the cows to find the total expenditure:\n   - Total expenditure = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows\n   - Total expenditure = $1,500 + $3,000 = $4,500\n\nTherefore, John spent a total of $4,500 at the market."
