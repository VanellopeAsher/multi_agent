      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered apart from the pizza, and then find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered based on the remaining amount.\n\nHere’s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal**:\n   - Cost of one chicken meal = $12\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the milk packs**:\n   - Each pack of milk costs $3.5\n   - Total cost for 5 milk packs = 5 packs × $3.5 = $17.5\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the apples**:\n   - Each apple costs $1.5\n   - Total cost for 4 apples = 4 apples × $1.5 = $6\n\n4. **Sum up the total costs calculated so far**:\n   - Total cost for chicken meal, milk packs, and apples = $12 + $17.5 + $6 = $35.5\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount spent on pizza**:\n   - Total amount paid by Marie = $52.5\n   - Remaining amount spent on pizza = Total amount paid - Cost of other items\n   - Remaining amount = $52.5 - $35.5 = $17\n\n6. **Determine the number of pizza boxes ordered**:\n   - Cost per box of pizza = $8.5\n   - Number of pizza boxes = Remaining amount / Cost per box\n   - Number of pizza boxes = $17 / $8.5 = 2\n\nTherefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.\n\nLet's discuss this approach and logical steps before proceeding further."
