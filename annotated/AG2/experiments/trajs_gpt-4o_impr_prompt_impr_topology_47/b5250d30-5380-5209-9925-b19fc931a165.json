So, they watch \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\) films.\n\n   Therefore, in one weekend, they watch a total of:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ films on Saturday} + 2 \\text{ films on Sunday} = 6 \\text{ films}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of films watched over 4 weeks:**\n   - Since they watch 6 films every weekend, in 4 weekends, they will watch:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ films/weekend} \\times 4 \\text{ weekends} = 24 \\text{ films}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Jill and her companions can view a total of 24 films in 4 weeks, maintaining their weekend routine."
