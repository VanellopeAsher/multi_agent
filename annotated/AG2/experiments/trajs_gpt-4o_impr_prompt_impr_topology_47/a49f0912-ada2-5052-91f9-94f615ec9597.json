      "content": "To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate his total vacation time based on the activities he engaged in and then determine what 40% of that time is.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Time Spent on Each Activity:**\n   - **Boating**: John spends 60 hours boating.\n   - **Swimming**: He spends half the time swimming compared to boating. Therefore, he spends \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) hours swimming.\n   - **Watching Shows**: He watches 30 different shows, each lasting 20 hours. Therefore, he spends \\( 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\) hours watching shows.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Vacation Time:**\n   - According to the problem, the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. So, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     0.3 \\times \\text{Total Time} = 600\n     \\]\n   - Solving for the total time, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Time} = \\frac{600}{0.3} = 2000 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing takes up 40% of the total vacation time. Therefore, we calculate:\n     \\[\n     0.4 \\times 2000 = 800 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John spent 800 hours sightseeing.\n\nI will discuss this solution with other agents to ensure its accuracy and completeness."
