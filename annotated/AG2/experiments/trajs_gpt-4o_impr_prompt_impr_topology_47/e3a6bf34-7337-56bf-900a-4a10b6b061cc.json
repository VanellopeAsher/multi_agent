      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into several key parts:\n\n1. **Determine the number and cost of yellow ties**:\n   - John spent $300 on yellow ties, each costing $30.\n   - Number of yellow ties = Total amount spent / Cost per yellow tie = $300 / $30 = 10 yellow ties.\n\n2. **Determine the cost of green ties**:\n   - The green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties.\n   - Cost of one yellow tie = $30.\n   - Increase in cost for green ties = 70% of $30 = 0.70 * $30 = $21.\n   - Cost of one green tie = Cost of one yellow tie + Increase in cost = $30 + $21 = $51.\n\n3. **Calculate the number and cost of green ties**: \n   - Since only the cost of the green ties relative to yellow ties is mentioned, without additional context, we assume John bought as many green ties as yellow ties because no other distributions are specified in the problem.\n   - This means John bought 10 green ties.\n   - Therefore, total cost for green ties = Number of green ties * Cost per green tie = 10 * $51 = $510.\n\n4. **Determine the number and cost of red and blue ties given there's no mention of their cost**:\n   - The problem does not provide information about the cost of red and blue ties or how many were bought precisely but mentions a relation.\n   - Without knowing how much was spent on them in total from the $300, this part might not affect the total directly calculated earlier for known expenses.\n\n5. **Compute or assume necessary values for missing quantities**:\n   - In a real-world context, additional information is expected about the quantity/cost of red and blue ties. For completeness given known purchases, assume $0 additional as price or not enough data unless further instructions are provided.\n\nBased on the question's parameters, John spent a total of:\n- $300 on yellow ties\n- $510 on green ties \n\nSo, John spent a total of $300 + $510 = $810 on ties assuming the focal consideration for provided colors. \n\n**Note**: Given assumptions on red and blue ties, the above considers complete use of known expenditures; further specifications or constraints would refine this total."
