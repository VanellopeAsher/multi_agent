Thus, the total time spent on activities is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ (boating) } + 3 \\text{ (swimming) } + 6 \\text{ (watch shows) } = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Total Vacation Time Spent:**\n   - Watching shows represented 30% of the total time.\n   - We know the time spent watching shows was 6 hours.\n\n   Therefore, \\(0.30 \\times \\text{Total Time} = 6 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n   Solving for Total Time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Time} = \\frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing accounted for 40% of the total time.\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 20 \\text{ (Total Time) } = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, John spent 8 hours sightseeing."
