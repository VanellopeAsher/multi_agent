Calculate the total number of articles published daily by both companies.\n3. Multiply the total daily articles by the number of days in February to find the overall number of articles published in the month.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Number of Days in February\n\n- The problem states that there are 2.8 times of ten days in February.\n- This means \\(2.8 \\times 10 = 28\\) days.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Daily Articles Published\n\n- The news website publishes an average of 20 articles (political and weather) each day.\n- Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business articles daily.\n- Therefore, the total number of articles published daily by both sites is:\n  \\[\n  20 + 10 = 30 \\text{ articles per day}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Articles in February\n\n- Given that there are 28 days in February:\n  \\[\n  30 \\times 28 = 840\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the two websites published a total of 840 articles together in February."
