Therefore, Sean has to memorize all 54 lines from the solo song.\n\n2. **First Scene**:\n   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. Therefore, it has \\(2 \\times 54 = 108\\) lines.\n   - Sean has to memorize one-third of these lines: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36\\) lines.\n\n3. **Second Scene**:\n   - The second scene has six more lines than the song: \\(54 + 6 = 60\\) lines.\n   - Normally, Sean would have to memorize four-fifths of these lines: \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48\\) lines.\n   - However, because one actor can't come, Sean needs to memorize an additional 15 lines in this scene.\n\n4. **Total Memorization in the Second Scene**:\n   - Total lines for the second scene Sean has to memorize: \\(48 + 15 = 63\\) lines.\n\n5. **Total Lines Sean has to memorize**:\n   - Lines from the song: 54\n   - Lines from the first scene: 36\n   - Lines from the second scene: 63\n   - Total: \\(54 + 36 + 63 = 153\\) lines.\n\nTherefore, Sean has to memorize a total of 153 lines."
