Therefore, \\( x - 10 \\) bandages were used.\n   - Bandages left at the end of the second day: \n     \\[\n     (69 - x) - (x - 10) = 79 - 2x\n     \\]\n\n4. **Third Day**:\n   - On the third day, two bulk packs (2 * 50) = 100 bandages were ordered. \n   - They also used half a pack (25 bandages).\n   - Bandages available after ordering: \n     \\[\n     79 - 2x + 100 = 179 - 2x\n     \\]\n   - Bandages left after using half a pack:\n     \\[\n     179 - 2x - 25 = 154 - 2x\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Condition**:\n   - At the end of the third day, they have 78 bandages left. Thus:\n     \\[\n     154 - 2x = 78\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     154 - 2x = 78\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     154 - 78 = 2x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     76 = 2x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 38\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of bandages used on the first day is **38**."
