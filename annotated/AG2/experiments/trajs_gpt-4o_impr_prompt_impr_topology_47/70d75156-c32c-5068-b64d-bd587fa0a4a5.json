      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Oranges**: Mrs. Harrington bought a certain number of oranges in boxes, where each box contains 20 oranges. We need to establish the total number of oranges based on the number of boxes she bought. Since this isn't directly given, let's assume she bought \\( x \\) boxes of oranges.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Oranges Given Away**: She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each. This means she gave away a total of \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) boxes.\n\n3. **Oranges in the Given Boxes**: The number of oranges given away is \\( 4 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ oranges per box} = 80 \\text{ oranges} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Remaining Oranges**: After giving away 4 boxes, Mrs. Harrington still has \\( x - 4 \\) boxes. The total number of oranges she has after giving away the 4 boxes would thus be \\((x - 4) \\times 20\\).\n\n5. **Determine the Oranges She Kept**: Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges after giving away the 4 boxes. Thus, the number of oranges she kept is \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times (x - 4) \\times 20\\).\n\n6. **Determine the Oranges Sold**: The oranges Mrs. Harrington sold would be the remainder. Therefore, the number of oranges sold is:\n   \\[\n   (x - 4) \\times 20 - \\frac{1}{4} \\times (x - 4) \\times 20 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times (x - 4) \\times 20\n   \\]\n\nWithout knowing the initial number of boxes \\( x \\), we cannot compute an exact number. However, the formula to find the number of oranges sold is \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times (x - 4) \\times 20\\). If Mrs. Harrington bought 4 boxes originally, she wouldn't have any to sell after giving two boxes each to her mom and sister. Therefore, \\( x > 4 \\) for her to sell some oranges.\n\nTo finalize the solution, we need the exact number of boxes she initially bought."

      "content": "For the final calculation, let's assume Mrs. Harrington initially bought, for instance, 10 boxes of oranges to provide a quantitative answer. You can adapt this number based on more specific details provided.\n\nGiven:\n- Each box contains 20 oranges.\n- She gave away 4 boxes, totaling \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\) oranges.\n- With \\( x = 10 \\) boxes initially, she's left with \\( 10 - 4 = 6 \\) boxes.\n- Out of the remaining 6 boxes, she kept 1/4 and sold the rest.\n\nLet's calculate the oranges sold using 10 boxes as an example:\n\n1. She kept \\( 1/4 \\) of the oranges in her remaining 6 boxes:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Oranges Kept} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 6 \\times 20 = \\frac{120}{4} = 30 \\text{ oranges}\n    \\]\n   \n2.

This assumption was necessary because, without the specific number of boxes she initially bought, the problem remains open-ended.\n\nThe calculations with the assumed 10 boxes follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Oranges**: Initial 10 boxes × 20 oranges/box = 200 oranges.\n2. **Oranges Given Away**: 4 boxes given away × 20 = 80 oranges.\n3. **Remaining Oranges**: 200 total - 80 given away = 120 oranges.\n4. **Oranges Kept (1/4 of Remaining)**: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 120 = 30 \\) oranges.\n5. **Oranges Sold**: 120 remaining - 30 kept = 90 oranges.\n\nWith the assumption of 10 initial boxes, Mrs. Harrington sold 90 oranges. \n\nHowever, following my guidelines and considering no specific number of initially purchased boxes was given, my instruction requires a declaration reflecting the unknowable nature of the problem without assumptions:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{\\text{None}}**"
