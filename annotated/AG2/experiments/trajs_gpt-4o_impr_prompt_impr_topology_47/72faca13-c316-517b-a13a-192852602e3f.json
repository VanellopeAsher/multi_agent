Thus, 5 quarters are 5 x 25 = 125 cents.\n   - Each dime is worth 10 cents. Thus, 2 dimes are 2 x 10 = 20 cents.\n   - So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost of Purchases**:\n   - Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents.\n   - She also buys a candy bar for 45 cents.\n   - The total cost of these purchases is 55 + 45 = 100 cents.\n\n3. **Find Out How Much Kelly Has Left**:\n   - Subtract the total cost of her purchases from the total money she has.\n   - 145 cents (total money) - 100 cents (cost of purchases) = 45 cents.\n\nTherefore, Kelly will have 45 cents left after her purchases."
