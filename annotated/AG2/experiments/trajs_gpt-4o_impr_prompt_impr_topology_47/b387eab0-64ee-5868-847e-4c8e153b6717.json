Initial cost for 10 gallons at $3.00 per gallon yields a total of $30.00.\n2. The cashback of $0.20 per gallon results in a total cashback of $2.00.\n3. Subtracting the cashback from $30.00 gives a net amount of $28.00.\n4. A 10% discount on $28.00 results in a discount of $2.80.\n5. Finally, $28.00 minus the $2.80 discount results in a final payment of $25.20.\n\nBoth approaches are correct and align perfectly.
