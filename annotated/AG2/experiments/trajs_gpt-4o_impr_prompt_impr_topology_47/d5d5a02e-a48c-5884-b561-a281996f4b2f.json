In 5 years, he will be 26 years old.\n2. When Emil turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad. Let's denote the father's current age as \\( F \\).\n3. In 5 years, his dad's age will be \\( F + 5 \\), and Emil's age will be half of it: \n   \\[\n   26 = \\frac{F + 5}{2}\n   \\]\n   Solving this equation will help us find the father's current age:\n   \\[\n   52 = F + 5 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F = 47\n   \\]\n\n4. Also, when Emil turns 26, he will be twice the age of his brother. Let \\( B \\) be the brother's current age.\n5. In 5 years, the brother will be \\( B + 5 \\), and Emil will be twice his age:\n   \\[\n   26 = 2(B + 5)\n   \\]\n   Solving this equation will help us find the brother's current age:\n   \\[\n   26 = 2B + 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   16 = 2B \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   B = 8\n   \\]\n\nNow, we have determined that the father's current age is 47, and his brother's current age is 8.\n\n6. Finally, we calculate the sum of the current ages of his dad and brother:\n   \\[\n   F + B = 47 + 8 = 55\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 55 years."
