She decided to keep 50 cards for herself.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cards remaining} = 350 - 50 = 300 \\text{ cards} \n   \\] \n\n5. **Calculate the number of students**:  \n   Miss Maria gives the remaining cards to her students, with each student receiving 10 cards.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students} = \\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
