      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many car tires the mechanic repaired on Friday based on the given conditions.\n\n**Step 1**: Calculate the earnings on Thursday.\n\n- On Thursday:\n  - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires. At $60 per truck tire, the earnings from truck tires are:\n    \\[\n    6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ dollars}\n    \\]\n  - The mechanic repairs 4 car tires. At $40 per car tire, the earnings from car tires are:\n    \\[\n    4 \\times 40 = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n    \\]\n  - Total earnings on Thursday:\n    \\[\n    360 + 160 = 520 \\text{ dollars}\n    \\]\n\n**Step 2**: Formulate the earnings equation for Friday.\n\n- On Friday, the mechanic repairs car tires only.\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n- The earnings from repairing car tires on Friday would be:\n  \\[\n  40x \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3**: Use the information about the difference in earnings to find \\( x \\).\n\n- It is given that the earnings on Thursday are $40 more than on Friday:\n  \\[\n  520 = 40x + 40\n  \\]\n\n- Solving for \\( x \\):\n  \\[\n  520 = 40x + 40\n  \\]\n  Subtract 40 from both sides:\n  \\[\n  480 = 40x\n  \\]\n  Divide both sides by 40:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{480}{40} = 12\n  \\]\n\nThus, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires on Friday.\n\n**Conclusion**: On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires."

The value should be 12, as derived by Agent Problem Solver. Let's verify.\n\nOutput: \n```python\n12\n```\n\nBoth the calculated approach and the code approach confirm that the mechanic repaired 12 car tires on Friday.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{12}"
