The number of doughnuts produced and sold each day.\n2. The number of days in June.\n\nOnce this is known, the formula to calculate the total money made in June will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Money} = (\\text{Number of doughnuts sold per day}) \\times (\\text{Price per doughnut}) \\times (\\text{Number of days in June}) \\]\n\nLet's use the following assumptions and steps:\n\n1. Suppose Derrick sells the same amount of doughnuts every day.\n2. There are 30 days in June.\n3. The price of each doughnut is $2.\n\nLet's say Derrick sells \\( n \\) doughnuts each day. By this assumption:\n\n- Daily earnings: \\( n \\times 2 \\)\n- Monthly earnings: \\( 30 \\times n \\times 2 \\)\n\nTherefore, Derrick's total earnings in June will be calculated as \\( 60n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of doughnuts sold per day.\n\nYou would need the specific number of doughnuts sold per day (\\( n \\)) to compute the exact total revenue."

Now, let's check both solutions, especially in terms of relying on assumptions vs. provided data:\n\n1. **Agent Problem Solver** elaborated on the need for the number of doughnuts sold per day to compute the total revenue and presented the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Money} = (\\text{Number of doughnuts sold per day}) \\times (\\text{Price per doughnut}) \\times (\\text{Number of days in June})\n   \\]\n   Then, the formula leads to \\(60n\\) where \\(n\\) is the daily doughnut sales.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor** provided a concrete calculation using an assumed value: Derrick sells 100 doughnuts per day, resulting in a revenue of \\$6000 for June, based on their calculation.\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not specify the number of doughnuts Derrick sells per day. Therefore, any calculations based on an assumed number of doughnuts per day do not result in a valid solution, as assumptions are not permissible.\n\nDue to the absence of this critical information (number of doughnuts sold per day), the problem is unsolvable under the given constraints.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**."
