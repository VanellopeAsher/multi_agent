The price of a small stuffed animal is $40.\n2. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it is \\( 3 \\times 40 = $120 \\).\n3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\( x = 2y \\).\n4. Teresa's total earnings from sales were $1200.\n\nWe can establish the following equation based on her earnings:\n\\[\n40x + 120y = 1200\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( x = 2y \\) into the earnings equation:\n\\[\n40(2y) + 120y = 1200\n\\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( y \\):\n\\[\n80y + 120y = 1200\n\\]\n\\[\n200y = 1200\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, use \\( y = 6 \\) to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 2y = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. \n\nI will now discuss this solution with the other agents."
