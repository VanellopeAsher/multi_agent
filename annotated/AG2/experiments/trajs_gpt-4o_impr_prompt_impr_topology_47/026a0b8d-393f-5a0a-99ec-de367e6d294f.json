Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( t \\) represent the number of packets of tomato seeds.\n   - Since the number of packets of celery seeds is given as 80, this doesn't need a variable.\n\n2. **Write the Equation for Total Cost**:\n   - The cost of \\( t \\) packets of tomato seeds at $40 per packet is \\( 40t \\).\n   - The cost of 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 per packet is \\( 80 \\times 30 = 2400 \\).\n   - The total cost of the seeds is given as $3200.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   \\[\n   40t + 2400 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equation**:\n   \\[\n   40t = 3200 - 2400\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   40t = 800\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{800}{40} = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds. \n\nLet's discuss this approach with the team and ensure the solution is verified and accurate."
