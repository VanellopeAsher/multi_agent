Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: \n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of pieces in the first lego set.\n\n2. **Express Other Sets in Terms of \\( x \\)**:\n   - The second set, which has 3 times more pieces than the first one, will have \\( 3x \\) pieces.\n   - The third set, which has \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the number of pieces of the first set, will have \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\) pieces.\n\n3. **Formulate the Total Number of Pieces**: \n   - Total pieces picked up by Johnny = \\( x + 3x + \\frac{x}{4} \\)\n\nLet's now solve this expression to find the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up.\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total pieces} = x + 3x + \\frac{x}{4} = 4x + \\frac{x}{4} \n\\]\n\n4. **Combine Terms**:\n   - To combine \\( 4x \\) and \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\), convert \\( 4x \\) to have the same denominator:\n\n\\[\n4x = \\frac{16x}{4}\n\\]\n\n5. **Add the Terms**:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16x}{4} + \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{17x}{4}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of lego pieces that Johnny picks up is \\(\\frac{17x}{4}\\), where \\( x \\) is the number of pieces in the first set. This expression represents the total blocks Johnny will pick up. \n\nIf any further details are provided, such as the specific number of pieces in the first set, we could calculate a numerical total. Otherwise, this is the algebraic solution to the problem. Let's discuss this with other agents to see if anyone else came to a similar conclusion or has additional insights."
