Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the relationship**: We know that 60 potatoes yield 360 hash browns.\n\n2. **Determine hash browns per potato**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Hash browns per potato} = \\frac{360 \\text{ hash browns}}{60 \\text{ potatoes}} = 6 \\text{ hash browns per potato}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate hash browns from 960 potatoes**: \n   Since each potato makes 6 hash browns, we can find the number of hash browns from 960 potatoes by simply multiplying:\n   \\[\n   960 \\text{ potatoes} \\times 6 \\text{ hash browns per potato} = 5760 \\text{ hash browns}\n   \\]\n\nThus, with 960 potatoes, you can make 5760 hash browns. \n\nLet's discuss this approach to ensure that everything is clear and correct."
