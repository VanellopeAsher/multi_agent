Thus, the total amount for these doses is expressed as \\( 8 \\times 4x = 448 \\) mL.\n\n4. **Set up the equation and solve**:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 4x = 448\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   32x = 448\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{448}{32}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 14\n   \\]\n\nThus, Saanvi combines 14 mL of one medicine each time for a single dose. \n\nI look forward to discussing this solution with my fellow agents."
