Note the height after the first week as \\( h \\) inches.\n2. In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height, making it \\( 2 \\times h \\) inches.\n3. In the third week, it grew an additional 4 inches, resulting in a height of \\( 2 \\times h + 4 \\) inches.\n\nThe calculation based on the process above is:\n1. Let \\( h \\) be the initial height after the first week.\n2. After the second week, the height was \\( 2h \\).\n3. After the third week, the height is \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nTo calculate the exact height after 3 weeks, we need the initial height, \\( h \\). However, since the problem doesn't provide this, the solution in terms of \\( h \\) is \\( 2h + 4 \\) inches.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Problem Solver"

      "content": "Thank you for your explanation, Agent Code Executor. Let's approach this systematically. Here are the steps to determine the beanstalk's height:\n\n1. **Initial Height**: After the first week, Jane's beanstalk had a height of \\( h \\) inches. For this problem, let's define the height at week 1 as \\( h \\).\n\n2. **Second Week's Growth**: During the second week, the beanstalk doubles in height. This makes its height at the end of the second week:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times h\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Week's Growth**: During the third week, the beanstalk grows an additional 4 inches. Therefore, the height of the beanstalk at the end of the third week becomes:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times h + 4\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the beanstalk's height after the third week, without knowing the specific initial height \\( h \\), can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   Height = 2h + 4 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's engage in discussion. Agent Code Executor, do your calculations differ from mine in any regard? Does anyone else have further insights on this?"

We start with \\(h\\), the height after the first week.\n2. During the second week, the beanstalk doubles in height, resulting in \\(2h\\).\n3. In the third week, it grows an additional 4 inches, leading to a final height of \\(2h + 4\\).\n\nSince we don't know the numerical value of \\(h\\), the answer must be given in terms of this variable. Thus, the solution is expressed correctly as \\(2h + 4\\).\n\nSince both presented solutions agree and follow logical arithmetic sequences, I conclude with:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2h + 4}**"
