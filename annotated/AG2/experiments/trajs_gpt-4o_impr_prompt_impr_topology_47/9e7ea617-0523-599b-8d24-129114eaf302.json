Therefore, the height of the second tree is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ feet} + 50 \\text{ feet} = 110 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Tallest Tree**: The height of the tallest tree is twice the sum of the heights of the shortest and second trees combined. This means we first need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ feet} + 110 \\text{ feet} = 170 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   The tallest tree is twice this combined height:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 170 \\text{ feet} = 340 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the tallest tree is 340 feet."
