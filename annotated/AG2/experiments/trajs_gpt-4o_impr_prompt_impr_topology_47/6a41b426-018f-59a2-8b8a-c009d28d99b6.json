      "content": "To solve the problem, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Total Distance**: John runs a total of 60 miles a week over three days.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Runs**:\n   - Let's assume John runs \\( x \\) miles on one day.\n   - On the other two days, he runs half as much, which is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) miles each day.\n\n3. **Equation Setup**: \n   - The total distance run per week is the sum of the distances he runs on each day.\n   - Therefore, the equation based on his running pattern is:\n     \\[\n     x + 2 \\times \\frac{x}{2} = 60\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we have:\n     \\[\n     x + x = 60 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2x = 60\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Equation**:\n   - Divide both sides by 2:\n     \\[\n     x = 30\n     \\]\n   - This means John runs 30 miles on his main running day.\n\n5. **Distance on the Other Two Days**:\n   - Since he runs half as much on the other two days, he runs:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\text{ miles on each of the other two days}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - To verify, calculate the weekly sum based on these distances:\n     \\[\n     30 + 15 + 15 = 60 \\text{ miles per week}\n     \\]\n   - This checks out correctly with the given problem.\n\nIn conclusion, John runs 30 miles on his primary running day and 15 miles on each of the other two days, maintaining a total of 60 miles per week. Since the problem statement does not specify his running speed in terms of time or speed per mile, the solution is focused on distance distribution per day."
