If he spends $10 each day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$10}{\\$5} = 2 \\text{ wooden action figures per day}\n   \\]\n   Thus, for four days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday):\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ wooden action figures}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Spending from Thursday to Saturday**:\n   From Thursday to Saturday, Peter will buy plastic action figures that cost $2.50 each. Spending $10 each day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$10}{\\$2.50} = 4 \\text{ plastic action figures per day}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, over three days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ plastic action figures}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Action Figures**: \n   Add the number of wooden action figures to the number of plastic action figures to find the total:\n   \\[\n   8 + 12 = 20 \\text{ total action figures}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 20 action figures. \n\nLet's discuss any further questions or insights with the team."
