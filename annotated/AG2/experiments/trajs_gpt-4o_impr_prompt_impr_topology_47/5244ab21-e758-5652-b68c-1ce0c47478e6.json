      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Oranges**: First, determine the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington purchased. Since there are 12 boxes, and each box contains 20 oranges, we can calculate the total as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Oranges} = 12 \\, (\\text{boxes}) \\times 20 \\, (\\text{oranges per box}) = 240 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Oranges Gifted**: Mrs. Harrington gave 2 boxes each to her mother and sibling. So, she gifted a total of:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges Gifted} = 4 \\, (\\text{boxes}) \\times 20 \\, (\\text{oranges per box}) = 80 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Oranges**: Subtract the gifted oranges from the total to find out how many are left:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining Oranges} = 240 - 80 = 160 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Oranges Kept by Mrs. Harrington**: She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges For Herself} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 = 40 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Oranges Sold**: The rest of the oranges were sold. So, subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges Sold} = 160 - 40 = 120 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges. \n\nI look forward to discussing this solution with the team."
