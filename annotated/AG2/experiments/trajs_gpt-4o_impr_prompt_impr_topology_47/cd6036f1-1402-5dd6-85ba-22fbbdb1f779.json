He regained 10 pounds during the 2 months of recovery (5 pounds/month).\n3. The net effect of the illness and recovery is a 20-pound loss (30 lost - 10 gained).\n4. Starting from a final weight of 70 pounds and considering the net loss of 20 pounds, the initial weight is calculated as 90 pounds.\n\n### Agent Code Executor's Output:\nThe code calculates the initial weight as 50 pounds.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- **Agent Problem Solver** correctly computes the initial weight based on the given steps.\n- **Agent Code Executor** made some errors in the implementation or logic with the result of 50 which doesn't align with the expected outcome.\n\nGiven the consistency and correctness of the manual calculation by the Agent Problem Solver, the initial weight before Mark fell ill is indeed 90 pounds:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{90}**"
