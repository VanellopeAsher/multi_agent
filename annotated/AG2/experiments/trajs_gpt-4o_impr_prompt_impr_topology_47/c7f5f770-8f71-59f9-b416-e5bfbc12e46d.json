Kyle took 6, so Billy takes 2 * 6 = 12 fries.\n   - Griffin's fries = 24 - 12 = 12 fries.\n\n4. **After Ginger**: Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin as \\( x \\).\n   - Griffin's fries = 12 + \\( x \\).\n\n5. **After Colby**: Colby takes 3 less than the amount Kyle took. Kyle took 6 fries, so Colby takes 6 - 3 = 3 fries.\n   - Griffin's fries = 12 + \\( x \\) - 3 = \\( x \\) + 9 fries.\n\n6. **Final Count**: It is given that Griffin ends up with 33 fries.\n   - Therefore, \\( x + 9 = 33 \\).\n\n7. **Solving for \\( x \\)**: We solve for \\( x \\) by:\n   \\[\n   x + 9 = 33 \\\\\n   x = 33 - 9 \\\\\n   x = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries.
