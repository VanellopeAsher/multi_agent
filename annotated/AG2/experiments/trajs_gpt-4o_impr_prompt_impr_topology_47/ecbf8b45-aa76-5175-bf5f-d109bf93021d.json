This is given by the number of packs multiplied by the number of balloons per pack.\n   \n2. Next, we need to find out how many balloons are left after the fight.\n\n3. Finally, subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons initially available to find out how many balloons were thrown.\n\nHere's the solution broken down:\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P \\) as the number of packs.\n- Each pack contains 30 balloons.\n- 12 balloons are left at the end of the afternoon.\n\nThe number of balloons thrown \\( B \\) can be calculated using the equation:\n\n\\[ B = 30P - 12 \\]\n\nHowever, since the number of packs is not given, we cannot compute a specific numerical answer. We can only express the answer in terms of \\( P \\). If a specific number of packs is known, this calculation can be completed by substituting that number into the equation. \n\nWould you like to discuss how we could obtain the number of packs?"
