Therefore, the equation representing the total number of cards is:\n\n\\[\nP + 3P + (3P + 0.12) = 3.41\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[\nP + 3P + 3P + 0.12 = 3.41\n\\]\n\\[\n7P + 0.12 = 3.41\n\\]\n\nSubtract 0.12 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n7P = 3.41 - 0.12\n\\]\n\\[\n7P = 3.29\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 7 to solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{3.29}{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nP = 0.47\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of hundreds of cards Becca has:\n\n\\[\n3P + 0.12 = 3(0.47) + 0.12\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1.41 + 0.12\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1.53\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Becca has 1.53 hundred cards.\n\nKnowing that 0.01 hundred equals one card, Becca has:\n\n\\[\n1.53 \\times 100 = 153 \\text{ cards}\n\\]\n\nThis solution finds the number of cards Becca has.
