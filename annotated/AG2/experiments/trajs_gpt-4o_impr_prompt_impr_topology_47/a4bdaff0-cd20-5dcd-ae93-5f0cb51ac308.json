      "content": "To calculate how much Jessica will pay in a year if she opts to pay 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minimum Monthly Payments**:\n   - Student Loans: $3000/month\n   - Credit Card: $2000/month\n   - Mortgage: $5000/month\n\n2. **Calculate the Additional Payment**:\n   - Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so the additional payment is 50% of the minimum for each type of debt.\n\n3. **Compute the Increased Monthly Payment for Each Debt**:\n   - Student Loans:\n     - Minimum = $3000\n     - Additional 50% = $3000 * 0.50 = $1500\n     - Total Monthly Payment = $3000 + $1500 = $4500\n   - Credit Card:\n     - Minimum = $2000\n     - Additional 50% = $2000 * 0.50 = $1000\n     - Total Monthly Payment = $2000 + $1000 = $3000\n   - Mortgage:\n     - Minimum = $5000\n     - Additional 50% = $5000 * 0.50 = $2500\n     - Total Monthly Payment = $5000 + $2500 = $7500\n\n4. **Sum the Total Monthly Payments**:\n   - Total Monthly Payment = $4500 (Student Loans) + $3000 (Credit Card) + $7500 (Mortgage)\n   - Total Monthly Payment = $15000\n\n5. **Compute the Annual Payment**:\n   - Total Annual Payment = Total Monthly Payment * 12\n   - Total Annual Payment = $15000 * 12 = $180,000\n\nTherefore, if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum payment each month, she will pay $180,000 in a year. \n\nLooking forward to insights and validations from the rest of the team!"
