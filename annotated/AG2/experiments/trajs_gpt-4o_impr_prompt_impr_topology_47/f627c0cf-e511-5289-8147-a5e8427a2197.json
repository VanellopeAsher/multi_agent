      "content": "To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to ascertain how much weight he lost and add that to his final weight.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Weight Loss:**\n   - First, we need to know for how many months Mark was losing weight. However, this information is not directly given in the problem, so we'll assume we need to find it out based on the total weight loss and rate of loss.\n\n2. **Create an Equation:**\n   - Let's denote Mark's initial weight as \\( W \\).\n   - Since Mark lost weight at a rate of 10 pounds per month, if we let \\( m \\) represent the number of months he was unwell, the total weight lost over this period is \\( 10 \\cdot m \\).\n   - We know his final weight was 70 pounds, so the equation modeling this scenario is:\n     \\[\n     W - 10 \\cdot m = 70\n     \\]\n   - Rearrange the equation to find \\( W \\):\n     \\[\n     W = 70 + 10 \\cdot m\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without specific information on how many months Mark was unwell, we can't determine a single value for his initial weight. However, his initial weight can be expressed as a function of the number of months:\n     \\[\n     W = 70 + 10m\n     \\]\n   - To find the exact weight, additional data regarding the duration of his illness is required.\n\nIn absence of further details, this expression provides his initial weight in terms of the months he was unwell. If further information is provided, we can substitute \\( m \\) with the number of months to get a numerical value for his initial weight."
