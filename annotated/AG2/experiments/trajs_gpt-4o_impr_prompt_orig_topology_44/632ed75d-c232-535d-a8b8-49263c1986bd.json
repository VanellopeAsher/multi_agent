      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "To determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France, let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Express the Total Flights of the First Aircraft**\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the total number of flights made by the first aircraft each day.\n\n**Step 2: Breakdown of the First Aircraft's Flights**\n\n- To Greece: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times x \\) flights\n- Remaining flights = \\( x - \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{1}{4}x \\)\n\nThese remaining flights are evenly divided between France and Germany.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Flights to France for the First Aircraft**\n\nSince the remaining \\( \\frac{1}{4}x \\) flights are split evenly between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4}x = \\frac{1}{8}x\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Relate the Flights of the First and Second Aircraft**\n\nThe second aircraft flies 44 flights daily to Poland, which equals half the flights of the first aircraft. Expressing this mathematically:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x = 44\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 44 \\times 2 = 88\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Flights to France**\n\nNow substitute \\( x = 88 \\) into the expression for flights to France:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} \\times 88 = 11\n\\]\n\nThus, the first aircraft makes 11 flights to France each day.\n\nTo ensure all calculations and breakdowns of the problem are accurately followed, let us perform VERIFICATION:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Total flights for the first aircraft, \\( x = 88 \\), meets the problem's condition where half of them (44) match the number of flights by the second aircraft.\n2. \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 \\) flights to Greece = 66 flights.\n3. Remaining flights: \\( 88 - 66 = 22 \\).\n4. Flights to France and Germany:\n   - Total \\( 22 \\) flights split equally gives \\( \\frac{22}{2} = 11 \\) flights each to France and Germany.\n\nAll steps check out correctly, confirming the first aircraft makes 11 flights to France daily.\n\nHence, the answer is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."
