Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 50 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of each final piece of ribbon after the given cutting process. We will approach the solution step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the length of each of the 40 equal parts:**\n\n   Marty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon to start with, which he will cut into 40 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide the total length of the ribbon by 40.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of one part} = \\frac{10000 \\text{ mm}}{40}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the length of each of the 50 equal parts for one of the 40 parts:**\n\n   Each of the 40 parts will then be divided into 50 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide the length of one part from step 1 by 50.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each final cut} = \\frac{\\text{Length of one part}}{50}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these using Python and the `sympy` library to ensure precise calculations in fraction form.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total ribbon length in millimeters\ntotal_length = 10000\n\n# Number of parts to cut initially\ninitial_parts = 40\n\n# Number of parts to cut each initial part into\nfinal_parts_per_initial = 50\n\n# Length of each initial part\nlength_per_initial_part = Rational(total_length, initial_parts)\n\n# Length of each final part\nlength_per_final_part = Rational(length_per_initial_part, final_parts_per_initial)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(length_per_final_part)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. Compute the first step: \\( \\frac{10000}{40} = 250 \\text{ mm} \\).\n2. Compute the second step: \\( \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\text{ mm} \\).\n3. Both operations are straightforward divisions, and the use of fractions ensures the accuracy of results in rational form.\n\nThe calculations confirm that each final cut will be 5 mm long.\n\nThus, the length of each final cut is \\( \\boxed{5} \\)."
