Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total price Clara paid for her apples on Tuesday and compare it with the total amount Sheila paid on Wednesday, taking into account the discount she received.\n\nHere’s the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Calculate Clara's Cost on Tuesday:**\n   - Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.\n   - Total cost before any discount: \\( 15 \\times 15 \\).\n   - She had a $3 voucher discount.\n\n2. **Calculate Sheila's Cost on Wednesday:**\n   - Sheila bought 15 apples at $25 each.\n   - Total cost before any discount: \\( 15 \\times 25 \\).\n   - Sheila received a 15% discount on the total cost.\n\n3. **Find the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total cost Clara paid from the total cost Sheila paid to find the difference.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Clara's cost\nprice_per_apple_tuesday = 15\nnumber_of_apples = 15\ntotal_cost_clara = number_of_apples * price_per_apple_tuesday\nvoucher_discount = 3\nfinal_cost_clara = total_cost_clara - voucher_discount\n\n# Sheila's cost\nprice_per_apple_wednesday = 25\ntotal_cost_sheila = number_of_apples * price_per_apple_wednesday\npercentage_discount = Rational(15, 100)\ndiscount_amount_sheila = total_cost_sheila * percentage_discount\nfinal_cost_sheila = total_cost_sheila - discount_amount_sheila\n\n# Compute the difference\ndifference = final_cost_sheila - final_cost_clara\n\nprint(f\"Difference in final prices: {difference}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Clara's Total Cost:**\n   - Initial cost: \\(15 \\times 15 = 225\\).\n   - After $3 voucher: \\(225 - 3 = 222\\).\n\n2. **Sheila's Total Cost:**\n   - Initial cost: \\(15 \\times 25 = 375\\).\n   - 15% discount: \\(375 \\times 0.15 = 56.25\\).\n   - After discount: \\(375 - 56.25 = 318.75\\).\n\n3. **Difference Calculation:**\n   - Difference: \\(318.75 - 222 = 96.75\\).\n\nRealizing we need exact representations, we'll format and verify as needed using rational numbers or fractions if important for precision.\n\n\\[\\boxed{96.75}\\]\n\nHence, the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is $96.75."
