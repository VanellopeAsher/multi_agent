Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use Python to calculate how many seashells were brought by each girl. Let's break it down using a step-by-step approach:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n- We have a total of 200 kids, divided equally between boys and girls, which means there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n- Each boy brings back 600 seashells.\n- The girls bring back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Seashells\n- Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.\n- Use this result to find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, using the given condition.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Problem using Python\n\nLet's write the code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Number of boys and girls\nboys = 100\ngirls = 100\n\n# Seashells each boy brings\nseashells_per_boy = 600\n\n# Total seashells brought by boys\ntotal_seashells_boys = boys * seashells_per_boy\n\n# Let x be the number of seashells each girl brings\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total seashells brought by girls\n# (Each girl brings x seashells, and total girls are 100)\ntotal_seashells_girls = girls * x\n\n# The number of seashells brought by the girls is the amount equal to the boys' total\n# plus four times that of the boys' total.\ngirls_condition = Eq(total_seashells_girls, total_seashells_boys + 4 * total_seashells_boys)\n\n# Solve for x\nseashells_per_girl = solve(girls_condition, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Each girl brings {seashells_per_girl} seashells.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\nNow, let's verify our calculations:\n- The boys collectively bring `100 * 600 = 60,000` seashells.\n- The girls together should bring `60,000 + 4 * 60,000 = 300,000` seashells.\n- Each girl, therefore, brings `300,000 / 100 = 3,000` seashells, matching our solution.\n\nThe number of seashells brought by each girl is consistent with the problem statement and calculations. Thus, we can confidently present the final boxed answer:\n\n\\(\\boxed{3000}\\)"
