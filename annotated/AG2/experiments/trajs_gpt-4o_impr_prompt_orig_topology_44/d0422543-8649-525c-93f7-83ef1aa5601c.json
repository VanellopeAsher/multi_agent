Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize algebraic equations to determine the son's age. Let's follow the Direct Python Solution approach and use sympy, a symbolic mathematics library in Python, to set up and solve the equation.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe know the following from the problem statement:\n1. Carver's age is 60 years.\n2. Carver's age is 8 years less than twice his son's age.\n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the son's age. According to the problem, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x - 8 = 60 \\]\n\nWe need to solve this equation for \\( x \\) to find the son's age.\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(2*x - 8, 60)\n\n# Solve the equation\nson_age = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"The son's age is\", son_age, \"years.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\nLet's verify our solution step-by-step:\n1. **Setup the equation:** \\( 2x - 8 = 60 \\).\n2. **Add 8 to both sides:** \\( 2x = 68 \\).\n3. **Divide by 2 to isolate \\( x \\):** \\( x = 34 \\).\n\nRechecking the problem conditions:\n- Twice the son's age is \\( 2 \\times 34 = 68 \\).\n- 68 minus 8 equals Carver's age (60).\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the solution is correct.\n\n\\(\\boxed{34}\\)"
