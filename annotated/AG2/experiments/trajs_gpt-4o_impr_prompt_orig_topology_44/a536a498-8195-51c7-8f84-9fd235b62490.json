      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the numbers reported by Courtney and Kelly. According to the problem, Courtney overstated the number of attendees by 20%.\n\nLet's break down the steps to get the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Overstatement**:\n   - If Courtney overstated the actual number by 20%, this means her reported number was 120% of the actual number of attendees.\n   \n2. **Determine the Actual Attendees**:\n   - We know from Kelly that the actual number of attendees was 40.\n\n3. **Calculate Courtney's Reported Number**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the actual number of attendees. According to Kelly, \\( x = 40 \\).\n   - Courtney's reported number would then be \\( 1.2 \\times x = 1.2 \\times 40 \\).\n\nWe will calculate this using Python as follows:\n\n```python\n# Using the given data to calculate Courtney's reported number of attendees.\nactual_attendees = 40\ncourtney_reported = 1.2 * actual_attendees\nprint(int(courtney_reported))\n```\n\nNow, let's calculate and check the result.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nWe know Courtney overstated the audience by 20%, which means:\n- Her reported number was meant to be 120% of the actual figure.\n- Kelly stated the actual number was 40.\n\nThus:\n\\[ \\text{Courtney's Reported Number} = 1.2 \\times 40 = 48 \\]\n\nThis confirms Courtney reported 48 attendees.\n\n\\(\\boxed{48}\\)"
