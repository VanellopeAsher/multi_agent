Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's employ a step-by-step approach to decipher how many articles Meredith wrote each day, given the constraints. We will also verify our calculations along the way using Python and sympy for symbolic computation.\n\n### Step-by-step Process:\n\n1. **Translate the problem into algebraic expressions.**\n   - Articles written on Monday: \\( M = 5 \\).\n   - Articles written on Tuesday: \\( T = M \\times \\frac{7}{5} = 7 \\).\n   - Total hours spent writing: 104 hours, where each article takes 4 hours.\n\n2. **Formulate the equation using the total hours:**\n\n   The expression for total hours spent writing is given by:\n   \\[\n   (M + T + W) \\times 4 = 104\n   \\]\n   where \\( W \\) is the number of articles written on Wednesday.\n\n3. **Substitute the known values:**\n   \\[\n   (5 + 7 + W) \\times 4 = 104\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( W \\):**\n   - Simplify the equation: \\( 12 + W = \\frac{104}{4} \\).\n   - Solve for \\( W \\): \\( W = 26 - 12 = 14 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate how many times more articles were written on Wednesday as compared to Tuesday:**\n\n   - Articles written on Tuesday: \\( T = 7 \\).\n   - Articles written on Wednesday: \\( W = 14 \\).\n   - Ratio: \\(\\frac{W}{T} = \\frac{14}{7} = 2\\).\n\n6. **Verification of the solution:**\n\n   - Articles on Monday: 5, Tuesday: 7, Wednesday: 14.\n   - Total articles = \\(5 + 7 + 14 = 26\\).\n   - Total hours spent = \\(26 \\times 4 = 104\\).\n   - Ratio of articles on Wednesday to Tuesday = \\( \\frac{14}{7} = 2 \\).\n\nNow that we've verified our calculation, we can output the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the number of articles\nM = 5  # Monday\nT = M * Fraction(7, 5)  # Times more than Monday\nT = 7  # Simplified value\n\n# Equation and solving for W\nW = Symbol('W', integer=True)\ntotal_hours_equation = Eq((M + T + W) * 4, 104)\n\n# Solve for W\nW_value = solve(total_hours_equation, W)[0]\n\n# Calculate the ratio\nratio = W_value / T\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The number of times as many articles written on Wednesday as on Tuesday is: {ratio}\")\n```\n\nThus, the number of times Meredith wrote more articles on Wednesday than on Tuesday is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
