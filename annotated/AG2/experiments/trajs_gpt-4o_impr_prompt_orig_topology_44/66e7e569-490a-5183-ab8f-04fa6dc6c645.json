Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes if 60 potatoes make 360 hash browns, we need to calculate the ratio of hash browns to potatoes.\n\n### Problem Solving Approach\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given ratio.**\n\nWe are given that 60 potatoes make 360 hash browns. Therefore, each potato yields a certain number of hash browns. We can calculate how many hash browns one potato makes by dividing the total hash browns by the total potatoes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hash browns per potato} = \\frac{360}{60}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of hash browns per potato.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hash browns per potato} = \\frac{360}{60} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, each potato makes 6 hash browns.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of hash browns from 960 potatoes.**\n\nGiven that each potato makes 6 hash browns, 960 potatoes will make:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hash browns} = 960 \\times 6\n\\]\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using Python.\n\n```python\n# calculate hash browns per potato\nhash_browns_per_potato = 360 / 60\n\n# calculate total hash browns from 960 potatoes\ntotal_hash_browns = 960 * hash_browns_per_potato\n\n# print the result\nprint(int(total_hash_browns))\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Check the Ratio Calculation:**\n   - Calculation: \\(\\frac{360}{60} = 6\\)\n   - Verified as correct: Each potato makes 6 hash browns.\n\n2. **Verification of the Final Calculation:**\n   - 960 potatoes with 6 hash browns each results in:\n     \\[\n     960 \\times 6 = 5760\n     \\]\n   - The calculation is consistent with our reasoning and initial setup.\n\nHence, the total number of hash browns made from 960 potatoes is \\( boxed{5760} \\)."
