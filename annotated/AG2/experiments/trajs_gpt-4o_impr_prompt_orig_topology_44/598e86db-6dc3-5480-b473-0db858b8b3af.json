Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people Billy helps per hour, based on the information provided. Here's how we can tackle this step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Days Billy Helps\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.\n\n- March has 31 days.\n- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.\n\nThus, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is \\(31 + 19 = 50\\) days.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Days Billy Does Not Take Off\n\nBilly takes 20% of these days off.\n\n20% of 50 is:\n\\[ 0.2 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ days off} \\]\n\nSo, Billy works for:\n\\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ days} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Hours Billy Works\n\nGiven that Billy works 3 hours a day, the total number of hours he works during these days is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ days} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/day} = 120 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of People Billy Helps Per Hour\n\nBilly helps a total of 240 people. To find out how many people he helps per hour, we divide the total number of people by the total number of hours he works:\n\\[ \\frac{240 \\text{ people}}{120 \\text{ hours}} = 2 \\text{ people per hour} \\]\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify this computation:\n\n1. Calculate total days between March 1 and April 19:\n   - Days in March: 31\n   - Days in April: 19\n   - Total days: \\(31 + 19 = 50\\)\n\n2. Calculate working days:\n   - Days taken off: \\(0.2 \\times 50 = 10\\)\n   - Working days: \\(50 - 10 = 40\\)\n\n3. Calculate total working hours: \n   - \\(40 \\text{ days} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/day} = 120 \\text{ hours}\\)\n\n4. Calculate rate per hour:\n   - \\(\\frac{240}{120} = 2 \\text{ people per hour}\\)\n\nEach step checks out, confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the number of people Billy helps per hour is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
