Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  The alcohol content of cognac is 15% stronger than scotch.  How much does he spend on everything?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to determine the total cost John pays for both scotch and cognac. Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Find the Cost Per Bottle of Scotch:**\n   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600.\n   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \\frac{600}{10} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Cost Per Bottle of Cognac:**\n   - The problem states that cognac costs 50% more than scotch.\n   - Thus, the cost per bottle of cognac is 1.5 times the cost of a scotch bottle:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \\times 1.5 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Bottles of Cognac Purchased:**\n   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.\n   - Therefore, he buys \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) bottles of cognac.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Cost for Cognac:**\n   - The total cost for cognac can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \\times 90 = 1800 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Spending:**\n   - The total spent on both scotch and cognac is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Total cost of scotch} + \\text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's present this analysis using Python with the `sympy` library to ensure accuracy and adherence to the specified output format:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Cost per bottle of scotch\ncost_scotch_per_bottle = Rational(600, 10)\n\n# Cost per bottle of cognac, 50% more than scotch\ncost_cognac_per_bottle = cost_scotch_per_bottle * Rational(3, 2)\n\n# Number of cognac bottles is twice the number of scotch bottles\nnum_cognac_bottles = 10 * 2\n\n# Total cost for coganc\ntotal_cost_cognac = num_cognac_bottles * cost_cognac_per_bottle\n\n# Total spend on everything\ntotal_cost = 600 + total_cost_cognac\n\n# Printing the result in fraction form\nprint(f'Total cost in dollars: {total_cost}')\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- We've calculated and verified that the scotch cost per bottle is $60.\n- The cost per bottle of cognac is correctly calculated as 50% more, resulting in $90.\n- The number of cognac bottles is twice the number of scotch bottles, also correctly calculated.\n- All calculations have been verified for correctness.\n\nThus, the verified total spending John makes on scotch and cognac is \\(\\boxed{2400}\\) dollars."
