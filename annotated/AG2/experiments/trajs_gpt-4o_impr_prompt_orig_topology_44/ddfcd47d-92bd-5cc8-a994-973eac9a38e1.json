Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $150, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to go through a few straightforward calculations. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Known Values\n- Aurelia has $150.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Kassidy's Money\n- According to the problem, Kassidy has \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of Aurelia's money. \n- Kassidy's amount = \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 150\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Rayna's Money\n- Rayna has $70 more than Kassidy.\n- Rayna's amount = (Kassidy's amount) + 70.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Total Money\n- Total money = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount.\n\n### Step 5: Divide Equally\n- Each person will have an equal share of the total money divided among them.\n\nLet's implement the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Kassidy's money\naurelia_money = 150\nkassidy_money = Rational(2, 3) * aurelia_money\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Rayna's money\nrayna_money = kassidy_money + 70\n\n# Step 4: Calculate total money\ntotal_money = aurelia_money + kassidy_money + rayna_money\n\n# Step 5: Divide equally among three people\nequal_share = total_money / 3\n\n# Print results\nprint(f\"Aurelia's money: ${aurelia_money}\")\nprint(f\"Kassidy's money: ${kassidy_money}\")\nprint(f\"Rayna's money: ${rayna_money}\")\nprint(f\"Each person's equal share: ${equal_share}\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates how much money each person has initially, the total amount of money, and what each person would have if they combined their money and divided it equally. \n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nWe'll verify each calculation step:\n1. Calculate Kassidy's portion: \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = 100\\).\n2. Rayna has $70 more than Kassidy: \\(100 + 70 = 170\\).\n3. Total money: \\(150 + 100 + 170 = 420\\).\n4. Equal share for each: \\(\\frac{420}{3} = 140\\).\n\nAll calculations appear correct.\n\nFinal Answer: Kassidy, Rayna, and Aurelia would each have \\(\\boxed{140}\\) dollars if they shared their money equally."
