      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing. We can do this by first determining his total time spent on activities and then calculating the percentage represented by each activity. Let's break this problem down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Time Spent on Activities (excluding breaks and lunch)\n\n1. **Boating:** John spends 6 hours.\n2. **Swimming:** He swims for half the time he spent boating. Therefore, it's \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours.\n3. **Shows:** Each of the 3 shows is 2 hours long, so total time spent watching shows is \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours.\n4. **Sightseeing:** This accounts for 40% of his total activity time.\n5. **Breaks and Lunch:** These do not count towards the total activity time.\n\nGiven that the time spent watching shows accounts for 30% of the total activity time, we can calculate the total time he spent on activities.\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Equation\n\nLet \\( T \\) be the total time spent on activities.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- 30% of \\( T \\) is the time spent watching shows: \\( 0.3 \\times T = 6 \\).\n- 40% of \\( T \\) is the time spent sightseeing: \\( 0.4 \\times T \\).\n\nFind the total time \\( T \\) using the equation for the shows:\n\n\\[ 0.3T = 6 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( T \\)\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Equation for the shows time\nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, 6)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_activity_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate the sightseeing time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_activity_time\n\n# Print the sightseeing time\nprint(f\"The time John spent sightseeing is {sightseeing_time} hours.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Total time spent on activities:** From \\( 0.3T = 6 \\), solving gives \\( T = 20 \\) hours.\n2. **Verify each activity proportion:**\n   - Time spent on shows: \\( 6 \\) hours, which is 30% of 20 hours.\n   - Time spent on boating and swimming: \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\) hours.\n   - Time spent sightseeing: \\( 0.4 \\times 20 = 8 \\) hours.\n\nEach activity proportion matches the conditions given, verifying that the calculations are correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJohn spent \\(\\boxed{8}\\) hours sightseeing."

The fraction of time spent sightseeing is 40% of his activity time: \\(0.4 \\times T\\).\n\n### Python Code:\n\nWe will use Python to calculate the time spent on sightseeing.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Equation for total activity time\nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, 6)\n\n# Solve the equation for total activity time\ntotal_activity_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate the sightseeing time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_activity_time\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The time John spent sightseeing is {int(sightseeing_time)} hours.\")\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n```plaintext\nThe time John spent sightseeing is 8 hours.\n```\n\nThus, John spent \\(\\boxed{8}\\) hours sightseeing."

Total activity time (\\( T \\)) from the show data: \\( T = 20 \\) hours.\n2. Proportions of time:\n   - Shows: \\( 6 \\) hours, which is indeed 30% of 20 hours.\n   - Sightseeing: \\( 8 \\) hours, matches the 40% requirement.\n3.
