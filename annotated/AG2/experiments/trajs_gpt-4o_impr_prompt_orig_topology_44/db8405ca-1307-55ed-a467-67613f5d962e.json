Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn is a carpenter. For his friend Ali, he manufactured 40 wooden tables for $200 each and 20 roof frames for $100 each. How much does Ali have to pay John?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow a direct Python solution approach. We need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and roof frames separately, then sum these costs to find out how much Ali has to pay John.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. **Calculate the cost for wooden tables:**  \n   - John manufactured 40 wooden tables at $200 each. The total cost for the tables is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for tables} = 40 \\times 200\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost for roof frames:**  \n   - John manufactured 20 roof frames at $100 each. The total cost for the frames is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for frames} = 20 \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sum the costs to find the total amount Ali has to pay:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total payment} = \\text{Total cost for tables} + \\text{Total cost for frames}\n   \\]\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the specified format:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John\n\n# Cost calculation for tables\ncost_per_table = 200\nnumber_of_tables = 40\ntotal_cost_tables = number_of_tables * cost_per_table\n\n# Cost calculation for frames\ncost_per_frame = 100\nnumber_of_frames = 20\ntotal_cost_frames = number_of_frames * cost_per_frame\n\n# Total payment\ntotal_payment = total_cost_tables + total_cost_frames\n\n# Output the total amount\nprint(total_payment)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n- **Tables Calculation:** \n  - Each table costs $200. For 40 tables:\n    \\[\n    40 \\times 200 = 8000\n    \\]\n- **Frames Calculation:** \n  - Each frame costs $100. For 20 frames:\n    \\[\n    20 \\times 100 = 2000\n    \\]\n- **Total Payment Verification:**\n  \\[\n  8000 + 2000 = 10000\n  \\]\n\nOur calculation in Python should yield 10,000. Let's write the verification in boxed format:\n\n\\(\\boxed{10000}\\)\n\nThis is the amount Ali has to pay John."
