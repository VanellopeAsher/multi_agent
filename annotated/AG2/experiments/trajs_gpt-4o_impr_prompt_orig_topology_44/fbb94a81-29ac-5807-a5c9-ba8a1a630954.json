Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 18 years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age."

Substitute the expression for \\( p \\):\n   \\[\n   (q + j) + q + j = 100\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying gives us:\n   \\[\n   2q + 2j = 100\n   \\]\n   Dividing the entire equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   q + j = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute \\( q = j + 18 \\) into \\( q + j = 50 \\):\n   \\[\n   (j + 18) + j = 50\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   2j + 18 = 50\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( j \\):\n   \\[\n   2j = 32 \\Rightarrow j = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. Find \\( q \\) using \\( q = j + 18 \\):\n   \\[\n   q = 16 + 18 = 34\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, find \\( p \\) using \\( p = q + j \\):\n   \\[\n   p = 34 + 16 = 50\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\n\nWe verify if the sum of ages indeed adds up to 100:\n- \\( p + q + j = 50 + 34 + 16 = 100 \\)\n\nEverything checks out, therefore our solution is verified.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe age of Peter is \\(\\boxed{50}\\)."
