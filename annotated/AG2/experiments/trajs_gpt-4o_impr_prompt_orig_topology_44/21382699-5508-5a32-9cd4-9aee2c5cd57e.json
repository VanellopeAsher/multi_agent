Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now."

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to use the given information about the ratios of ages and the total age to find Allen's current age. Let's then calculate how old Allen will be 10 years from now.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Identify the Variables:**\n   - Let Darrell's age be \\(7x\\).\n   - Let Allen's age be \\(11x\\).\n   - The age ratio is given as \\(7:11\\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - We know their total age sums up to 162.\n   - Hence, the equation is: \\(7x + 11x = 162\\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\) to Find the Ages:**\n   - Combine the terms: \\(18x = 162\\).\n   - Solve for \\(x\\): \\(x = \\frac{162}{18}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate Darrell's and Allen's Ages:**\n   - Darrell's age, \\(7x\\), and Allen's age, \\(11x\\).\n\n5. **Find Allen's Age 10 Years from Now:**\n   - Calculate Allen's current age using \\(x\\).\n   - Add 10 to Allen's current age.\n\nLet's solve it using Python with sympy for symbolic mathematics.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Declare the symbolic variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the total age\nequation = Eq(7*x + 11*x, 162)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Calculate current ages\ndarrell_age = 7 * solution[0]\nallen_age = 11 * solution[0]\n\n# Compute Allen's age 10 years from now\nallen_age_future = allen_age + 10\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Allen's age 10 years from now is {allen_age_future}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - The equation \\(18x = 162\\) gives \\(x = 9\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Individual Ages:**\n   - Darrell's current age: \\(7 \\times 9 = 63\\).\n   - Allen's current age: \\(11 \\times 9 = 99\\).\n\n3. **Total Age Check:**\n   - Total age: \\(63 + 99 = 162\\), which matches the given information.\n\n4. **Future Age Calculation for Allen:**\n   - Allen's future age: \\(99 + 10 = 109\\).\n\nAll calculations verify the requirements and equations provided.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAllen's age 10 years from now is \\(\\boxed{109}\\)."
