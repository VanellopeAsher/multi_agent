Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 80 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?"

      "content": "To solve the problem involving the distribution of 200 feet of fence between Sam and Harry, where Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam, we can approach it in a straightforward manner using algebra. \n\nLet's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as \\( x \\).\n\n### Key Idea\nThe core concept is to set up an equation based on the information provided and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n### Approach\nHarry gets 80 feet more than Sam, so the length of the fence that Harry receives is \\( x + 80 \\).\n\nTogether, Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence, which gives us the equation:\n\n\\[ x + (x + 80) = 200 \\]\n\nSimplify and solve this equation to find \\( x \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. Combine the terms in the equation:\n\n   \\[ 2x + 80 = 200 \\]\n\n2. Subtract 80 from both sides to isolate terms involving \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[ 2x = 120 \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[ x = 60 \\]\n\nSam receives 60 feet of fence, which is the amount left for him.\n\n### Verification\nLet's verify the solution:\n\n1. If Sam receives 60 feet, then Harry receives:\n\n   \\[ x + 80 = 60 + 80 = 140 \\]\n\n2. The total length of fence is:\n\n   \\[ 60 + 140 = 200 \\]\n\nThis confirms that our solution is correct since 200 feet is the total available.\n\n### Final Answer\nWith verification complete, the amount of fence left over for Sam is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]"
