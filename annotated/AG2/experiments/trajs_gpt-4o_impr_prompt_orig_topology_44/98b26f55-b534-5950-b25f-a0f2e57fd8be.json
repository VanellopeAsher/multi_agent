Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJordan plays video games every day. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent the time he dedicates to playing video games working instead. Since the problem doesn't specify how many hours Jordan spends on video games daily, we're missing necessary data to reach a numerical solution.\n\nLet's go through the structured approach:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n1. **Identify the missing data:** We need the number of hours Jordan plays video games every day to calculate potential earnings.\n2. **Formulate the calculation if data were available:**\n   - If we let \\( h \\) be the number of hours Jordan plays video games in a day, his weekly earnings by replacing that time with work would be: \\( \\text{Weekly Earnings} = h \\times 7 \\times 10 \\).\n\nSince we're unable to proceed without knowing the value of \\( h \\),  Jordan's daily video game hours, we conclude that the problem is unsolvable with the current information.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None}} \\]"
