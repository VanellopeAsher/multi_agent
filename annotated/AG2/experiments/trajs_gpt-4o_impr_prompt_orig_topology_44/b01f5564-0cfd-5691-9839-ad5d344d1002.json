Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of protein John consumes each week, given his daily intake of mushrooms.\n\n**Key idea:** \nEach 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein. We will calculate how much protein is present in John's daily intake of 300 grams of mushrooms and then scale this to a weekly (7-day) intake.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Daily Protein Intake:**\n   - **Step 1:** Calculate the protein content in one gram of mushrooms.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Protein per gram of mushrooms} = \\frac{4 \\text{ grams of protein}}{150 \\text{ grams of mushrooms}}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Step 2:** Calculate the total protein intake for 300 grams of mushrooms.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Daily protein intake} = 300 \\text{ grams} \\times \\text{Protein per gram of mushrooms}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Weekly Protein Intake:**\n   - Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week (7 days).\n\nWe will compute these using Python and the `sympy` library to ensure precise calculations in fraction form.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, pprint\n\n# Step 1: Calculate protein content per gram of mushrooms\nprotein_per_gram = Rational(4, 150)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate daily protein intake\ndaily_protein_intake = 300 * protein_per_gram\n\n# Weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein_intake = 7 * daily_protein_intake\n\n# Print result\npprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\nAfter running the code, the result will show the total amount of protein John consumes in a week in fractional form, maintaining precision as required by the problem statement.\n\n**VERIFICATION SECTION:**\n\n1. **Protein per gram of mushrooms:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{150} = \\frac{2}{75}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Daily protein intake for 300 grams:**\n   \\[\n   300 \\times \\frac{2}{75} = \\frac{600}{75} = 8 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Weekly protein intake (7 days):**\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 8 = 56 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\nAfter verifying each step of our calculations, we confidently present the final result:\n\n\\(\\boxed{56}\\)"
