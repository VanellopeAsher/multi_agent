      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. He also wants to make a duvet cover, 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.

      "content": "To find out how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy for both the comforter and the duvet cover, we can break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the size of the fabric needed for the comforter:**\n   - The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet.\n   - Jim wants the comforter to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\n   - Therefore, the dimensions of the comforter should be: \n     \\[\n     (6 + 2) \\text{ feet} \\times (8 + 2) \\text{ feet} = 8 \\text{ feet} \\times 10 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - The area required for the comforter is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 10 = 80 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the size of the fabric needed for the duvet cover:**\n   - The dimensions given for the duvet cover are 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.\n   - Thus, the area required for the duvet cover is:\n     \\[\n     9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total fabric required:**\n   - Add the area of the comforter and the duvet cover:\n     \\[\n     80 + 99 = 179 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\nFinally, Jim needs to buy a total of 179 square feet of fabric.\n\n### Verification\n\n1. Areas were calculated step-by-step.\n2. Addition of areas was conducted correctly.\n\nSince all calculations are verified, we find the total amount of fabric Jim needs:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{179} \\text{ square feet} \\]"
