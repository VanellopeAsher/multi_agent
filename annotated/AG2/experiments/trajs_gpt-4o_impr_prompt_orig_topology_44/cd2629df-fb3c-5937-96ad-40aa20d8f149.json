Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we can break it down into a series of straightforward calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Amount Owed with Interest:**\n\n   Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. Thus, the total debt with interest can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total owed} = 300 + 0.02 \\times 300\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Payments Made Over 11 Months:**\n\n   Stephen plans to pay $25 every month for 11 months. Therefore, the total amount paid in these 11 months is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total paid over 11 months} = 25 \\times 11\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Amount to be Paid on the Twelfth Month:**\n\n   Subtract the total amount paid over the 11 months from the total amount owed to get the amount Stephen still needs to pay on the twelfth month.\n\nLet's carry out these calculations using Python. We'll use the sympy library to ensure we maintain exact values, such as fractions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Calculation of total owed with interest\nprincipal = 300\ninterest_rate = 0.02\ntotal_owed = principal + interest_rate * principal\n\n# Calculation of total paid over 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\ntotal_paid_11_months = monthly_payment * 11\n\n# Remaining amount to be paid\nremaining_amount = total_owed - total_paid_11_months\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month:\", remaining_amount)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify these results manually:\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Interest Calculation:**\n\n   - 2% of $300 is $6.\n   - Total amount owed is $300 + $6 = $306.\n\n2. **Payments Over 11 Months:**\n\n   - $25 per month for 11 months is $275.\n\n3. **Remaining Payment Calculation:**\n\n   - $306 owed - $275 paid = $31 remaining to be paid.\n\nThus, the amount Stephen needs to pay his sister in the twelfth month is exactly $31. All calculations confirm this result.\n\nTherefore, the amount to be paid in the twelfth month, excluding any coin purchases, is \\(\\boxed{31}\\)."
