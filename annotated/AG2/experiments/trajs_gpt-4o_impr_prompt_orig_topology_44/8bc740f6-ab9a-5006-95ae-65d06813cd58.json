Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.

      "content": "To find the total number of articles published by the two websites in February, given that February has 2.8 times of ten days (which corresponds to 28 days), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of articles published by each website in one day:**\n   - The first website publishes 20 articles per day (political and weather).\n   - The sister company publishes 10 articles per day (business).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of articles published daily by both websites:**\n   - Total articles per day = 20 (political and weather) + 10 (business) = 30 articles.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of articles in February:**\n   - February typically has 28 days (since it's mentioned as 2.8 times of ten days).\n   - So, total articles for 28 days = 30 articles/day * 28 days.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of articles published using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of articles published by the news website per day\npolitical_weather_articles_per_day = 20\nbusiness_articles_per_day = 10\n\n# Total articles published by both websites in one day\ntotal_articles_per_day = political_weather_articles_per_day + business_articles_per_day\n\n# February has 28 days\ndays_in_february = 28\n\n# Total articles published in February\ntotal_articles_february = total_articles_per_day * days_in_february\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_articles_february)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the total.\n\nAfter calculating:\n\n```python\nprint(total_articles_february)\n```\n\nThe total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Daily Total Check:**\n   - 20 + 10 = 30 articles per day (correct).\n\n2. **Monthly Total Check:**\n   - 30 articles/day * 28 days = 840 articles (correct).\n\nHaving verified the steps and results, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is correctly calculated.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{840}\\)."
