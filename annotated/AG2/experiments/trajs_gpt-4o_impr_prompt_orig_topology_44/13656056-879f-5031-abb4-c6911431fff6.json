Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $300 every day. He worked for an entire week and spent a total of $1000. How much does he have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first determine Gerald's earnings and expenses for the week, and then calculate how much money he has left after his expenses.\n\n**Key Idea:** \nCalculate the total earnings for the week and subtract the total expenses to find the remaining amount.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Determine Total Earnings:**\n   - Gerald earns $300 per day.\n   - A week consists of 7 days.\n   - Total earnings for the week = \\(300 \\, \\text{dollars/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days}\\).\n\n2. **Identify Total Expenses:**\n   - Total expenses for the week are given as $1000.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Amount:**\n   - Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Total earnings calculation\ndaily_earnings = 300  # dollars per day\ndays_worked = 7\ntotal_earnings = daily_earnings * days_worked\n\n# Total expenses\ntotal_expenses = 1000  # dollars\n\n# Remaining amount calculation\nremaining_amount = total_earnings - total_expenses\n\n# Output the remaining amount\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount of money Gerald has left after paying for his expenses.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Total Earnings:**\n   \\[\n   300 \\, \\text{dollars/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 2100 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Remaining Amount Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   2100 \\, \\text{dollars} - 1000 \\, \\text{dollars} = 1100 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\nUpon verifying the result through the calculations provided, we conclude that the result is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the amount Gerald has left is \\(\\boxed{1100}\\)."
