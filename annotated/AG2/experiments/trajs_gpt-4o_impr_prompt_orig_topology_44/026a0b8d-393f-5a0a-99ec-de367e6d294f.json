Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's define the variables and create an equation based on the given information.\n\n**Key Information:**\n- Price of one packet of tomato seeds = $40\n- Price of one packet of celery seeds = $30\n- Number of packets of celery seeds = 80\n- Total amount spent = $3200\n\n**Objective:**\nFind the number of packets of tomato seeds bought.\n\n**Approach:**\nWe'll use a direct Python solution to solve this problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. Define the variable \\( t \\) as the number of packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought.\n2. Calculate the cost spent on celery seeds: 80 packets × $30 per packet.\n3. Use the total spending information to set up an equation to solve for \\( t \\).\n\nHere is the Python code using the `sympy` library for symbolic computations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nt = symbols('t')\n\n# Cost of celery seeds\ncost_celery = 80 * 30\n\n# Total cost equation\ntotal_cost = Eq(40 * t + cost_celery, 3200)\n\n# Solve for the number of tomato seed packets\ntomato_packets = solve(total_cost, t)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The number of packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought is {tomato_packets}.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Cost of celery seeds:**\n   - 80 packets × $30/packet = $2400.\n\n2. **Equation setup:**\n   - \\( 40t + 2400 = 3200 \\).\n\n3. **Solving the equation:**\n   \\[\n   40t = 3200 - 2400 \\\\\n   40t = 800 \\\\\n   t = \\frac{800}{40} = 20\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations verify that the number of tomato seed packets Mrs. Rylan bought is 20. Therefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
