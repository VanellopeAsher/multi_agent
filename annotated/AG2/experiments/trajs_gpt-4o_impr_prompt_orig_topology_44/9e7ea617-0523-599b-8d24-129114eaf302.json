      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 60 feet, and the second tree has a height of 50 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard based on the given information. \n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Identify the heights of each tree:**\n   - The shortest tree has a height of 60 feet.\n   - The second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest tree.\n\n2. **Calculate the height of the second tree:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the second tree} = 60 + 50 = 110 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum the heights of the first and second trees:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of the first two trees} = 60 + 110 = 170 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the height of the tallest tree:**\n   - The tallest tree's height is twice the height of the sum of the two trees, i.e., twice 170 feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \\times 170 = 340 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify the solution to ensure it is accurate.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- We started with the height of the shortest tree as 60 feet.\n- The second tree is correctly calculated as 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet.\n- We summed the heights of the two trees correctly to get 170 feet.\n- Finally, we calculated twice the sum, which accurately yields 340 feet.\n- Each calculation aligns with the problem's description and requirements.\n\nThus, the height of the tallest tree is \\( \\boxed{340} \\) feet."
