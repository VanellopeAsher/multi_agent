      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 0.1 times of one thousand years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 0.1 times of one hundred years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age."

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 0.1 times one thousand years:\n   \\[\n   P + L + J = 0.1 \\times 1000\n   \\]\n   \n2. Paul is 0.1 times one hundred years older than John:\n   \\[\n   L = 0.1 \\times 100 + N\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age:\n   \\[\n   P = L + N\n   \\]\n\nWe will solve these equations step by step using Python and the sympy library for symbolic computations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nP, L, J, N = symbols('P L J N')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(P + L + J, 0.1 * 1000)\neq2 = Eq(L, 0.1 * 100 + N)\neq3 = Eq(P, L + N)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (P, L, J, N))\n\n# Extract the age of Peter\nage_of_peter = solution[P]\n\n# Print the age of Peter\nprint(age_of_peter)\n```\n\nVerification:\n\n1. **Verify Equations:**\n   - Compute the sum \\( P + L + J \\) and verify if it equals 0.1 of one thousand years (100).\n   - Check if \\( L = 0.1 \\times 100 + N \\).\n   - Confirm \\( P = L + N \\).\n\n2. **Solution Verification:**\n   - Substitute the computed values into these equations to check consistency.\n\nOnce verified, the output will be the correct age of Peter, boxed in the requested format."

Thus, without additional info about \\(N\\), Peter's age is expressed in terms of John's age.\n\nGiven the correct output:\n\nThus, Peter's age can be written as:\n\\[ P = 2N + 10 \\]\n\nIf additional information about \\(N\\) (John's age) were provided, we could determine a precise numeric value.\n\nFinal boxed result with the current information:\n\n\\(\\boxed{2N + 10}\\)\n\nVerification steps:\n\n- By checking the equations and substitutions thoroughly, we confirm the solution aligns with the problem statement.\n- Make sure all steps satisfy the original conditions and any slots potential values for \\(N\\) translate into exact age for \\(P\\)."
