Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn November, a toy was $4000. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?"

      "content": "Key Idea:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the toy after two sequential price changes: an increase in December and a decrease in January.\n\n1. Calculate the increased price in December.\n2. Calculate the decreased price in January based on the December price.\n\nLet's compute these using a step-by-step process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate Price in December:**\n   - Initial price in November = $4000\n   - Increase in December = 80%\n   - New December price = November price + 80% of November price\n\n2. **Calculate Price in January:**\n   - Decrease in January = 50%\n   - New January price = December price - 50% of December price\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial price in November\nprice_november = 4000\n\n# Price increase in December by 80%\nincrease_percentage = Rational(80, 100)  # as a fraction\nprice_december = price_november * (1 + increase_percentage)\n\n# Price decrease in January by 50%\ndecrease_percentage = Rational(50, 100)  # as a fraction\nprice_january = price_december * (1 - decrease_percentage)\n\n# Print the final price in January\nprint(price_january)\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- Calculate the December price: \\(4000 \\times (1 + 0.8) = 4000 \\times 1.8 = 7200\\)\n- Calculate the January price: \\(7200 \\times (1 - 0.5) = 7200 \\times 0.5 = 3600\\)\n\nThe price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \\(\\boxed{3600}\\)."
