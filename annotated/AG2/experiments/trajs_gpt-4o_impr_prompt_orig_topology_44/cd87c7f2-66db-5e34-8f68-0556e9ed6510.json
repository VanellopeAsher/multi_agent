Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 100 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 120 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll be following Case 1: Direct Python Solution.\n\n**Key Idea**: Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons with 100 balloons each, totaling the initial number of balloons. By the end of the afternoon, only 120 balloons were left. We need to determine how many balloons were thrown, which is simply the difference between the total number of balloons and the number remaining.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of packs and balloons per pack\npacks = 10\nballoons_per_pack = 100\n\n# Calculate the total number of balloons\ntotal_balloons = packs * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon\nballoons_left = 120\n\n# Calculate the number of balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\n# Print the result\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. *Initial Total Balloons*: \n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ packs} \\times 100 \\text{ balloons/pack} = 1000 \\text{ balloons}\n   \\]\n\n2. *Balloons Left*: \n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ balloons left}\n   \\]\n\n3. *Balloons Thrown Calculation*: \n   \\[\n   1000 \\text{ balloons} - 120 \\text{ balloons} = 880 \\text{ balloons}\n   \\]\n\nVerification confirms that the calculation matches the scenario described. Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{880} \\]"
