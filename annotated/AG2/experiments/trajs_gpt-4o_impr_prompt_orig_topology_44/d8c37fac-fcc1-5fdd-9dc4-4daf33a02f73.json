Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKatherine has 50 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece. How much will she spend filling all 50 hanging baskets?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use case 1: Direct Python Solution.\n\nFirst, we note the following costs and quantities:\n\n1. Each hanging basket contains 30 petunias. Each petunia costs $3.00.\n2. Each hanging basket contains 20 sweet potato vines. Each vine costs $2.50.\n3. Katherine needs to fill 50 baskets.\n\nWe'll compute the total cost for all 50 baskets by calculating the cost per basket and then multiplying by the number of baskets.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of petunias for one basket: \\(30 \\text{ petunias} \\times \\$3.00\\).\n2. Calculate the cost of sweet potato vines for one basket: \\(20 \\text{ vines} \\times \\$2.50\\).\n3. Sum the costs to find the total cost per basket.\n4. Multiply the total cost per basket by 50 to find the total cost for all baskets.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the specified format:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to use Rational for handling costs\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the number and cost of petunias and vines per basket\nnum_petunias = 30\nnum_vines = 20\ncost_per_petunia = Rational(3, 1)  # $3.00\ncost_per_vine = Rational(5, 2)     # $2.50 as a fraction\n\n# Calculate cost per basket\ncost_petunias_per_basket = num_petunias * cost_per_petunia\ncost_vines_per_basket = num_vines * cost_per_vine\ncost_per_basket = cost_petunias_per_basket + cost_vines_per_basket\n\n# Calculate total cost for 50 baskets\ntotal_baskets = 50\ntotal_cost = total_baskets * cost_per_basket\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's verify the code step by step in the VERIFICATION section:\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. **Calculate cost of petunias per basket**:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 3 = 90\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate cost of sweet potato vines per basket**:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 2.5 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total cost per basket**:\n   \\[\n   90 + 50 = 140\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total cost for 50 baskets**:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times 140 = 7000\n   \\]\n\nThus, our computed result matches these calculations, meaning our solution logic and calculations are correct.\n\nThe final total cost Katherine will spend is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7000}\n\\]"
