  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a simple Python script to calculate the total cost of the items Elvira decided to buy and determine how much money she will have left for her new outfit. Let's go through the steps and implement the solution:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the costs of the items Elvira decided to buy:**\n   - Computer setup (includes screen, keyboard, mouse): €1090\n   - Scanner: €157\n   - CD burner: €74\n   - Printer: €102\n\n2. **Sum the total cost of the selected items.**\n\n3. **Subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she has left.**\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Amount gifted by her family\nbudget = 1500\n\n# Prices of the items Elvira decided to buy\ncomputer_cost = 1090\nscanner_cost = 157\ncd_burner_cost = 74\nprinter_cost = 102\n\n# Total cost of selected items\ntotal_cost = computer_cost + scanner_cost + cd_burner_cost + printer_cost\n\n# Calculate remaining budget for the outfit\nremaining_budget = budget - total_cost\n\n# Display the remaining budget\nprint(remaining_budget)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of Elvira's purchases:**\n   - Total cost = €1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer)\n   - Total cost = €1423\n\n2. **Subtract the total cost from the initial budget:**\n   - Remaining budget = €1500 - €1423\n   - Remaining budget = €77\n\n3. **Ensure calculations are correct:**\n   - The costs added together accurately reflect the chosen items.\n   - Subtraction from the budget is correct.\n\nThe final answer is €77 left for Elvira’s outfit.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{77} \\]"
