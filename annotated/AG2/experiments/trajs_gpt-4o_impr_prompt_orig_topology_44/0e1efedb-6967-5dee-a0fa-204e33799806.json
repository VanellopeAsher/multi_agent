Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26. She utilized a discount voucher that reduced her total by $7. What was the total amount of money my mother expended at the gardening store?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total expenditure after applying the discount.\n\n**Key Idea**: This problem can be solved using straightforward arithmetic calculations (Case 1: Direct Python Solution).\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.\n2. Apply the discount to determine the final amount paid.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the costs of the items\ncost_of_pots = 19\ncost_of_soil = 26\ndiscount = 7\n\n# Calculate the total cost before discount\ntotal_cost_before_discount = cost_of_pots + cost_of_soil\n\n# Apply the discount\ntotal_cost_after_discount = total_cost_before_discount - discount\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost_after_discount)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the solution.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Cost Before Discount**:  \n   The cost of the pots is $19, and the cost of the garden soil is $26. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \\( 19 + 26 = 45 \\).\n\n2. **Apply Discount**:  \n   The discount is $7. Subtract this from the total cost before the discount:  \n   \\( 45 - 7 = 38 \\).\n\nThe calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the total amount of money my mother spent at the gardening store is \\( \\boxed{38} \\)."
