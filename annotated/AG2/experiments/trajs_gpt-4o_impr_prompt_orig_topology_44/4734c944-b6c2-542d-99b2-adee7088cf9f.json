Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Peter spends each day and how many action figures he purchases throughout the week. Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate Daily Spending:**\n   - Peter has $70 for one week (7 days).\n   - Daily spending = Total money / Number of days = $70 / 7.\n\n2. **Determine Spending from Sunday to Wednesday:**\n   - Sunday to Wednesday is 4 days.\n   - During these days, Peter will spend his daily amount on wooden action figures, which cost $5 each.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Wooden Action Figures:**\n   - Wooden action figures purchased each day = Daily spending / Cost per wooden action figure.\n\n4. **Determine Spending from Thursday to Saturday:**\n   - Thursday to Saturday is 3 days.\n   - During these days, Peter spends his daily amount on plastic action figures, which cost $2.5 each.\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Plastic Action Figures:**\n   - Plastic action figures purchased each day = Daily spending / Cost per plastic action figure.\n\n6. **Calculate the Total Number of Action Figures Purchased:**\n   - Total action figures = (Number of wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday) + (Number of plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday).\n\nLet's implement this solution using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total money Peter has\ntotal_money = 70\n\n# Total number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Daily spending\ndaily_spending = Rational(total_money, days_in_week)\n\n# Cost of each wooden action figure\ncost_wooden_figure = 5\n# Cost of each plastic action figure\ncost_plastic_figure = Rational(5, 2)  # Equivalent to 2.5\n\n# Calculate number of wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday\ndays_wooden = 4\nwooden_figures_per_day = daily_spending / cost_wooden_figure\ntotal_wooden_figures = days_wooden * wooden_figures_per_day\n\n# Calculate number of plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday\ndays_plastic = 3\nplastic_figures_per_day = daily_spending / cost_plastic_figure\ntotal_plastic_figures = days_plastic * plastic_figures_per_day\n\n# Total action figures\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Total action figures:\", total_action_figures)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Daily Spending:**\n   - Verify that Peter spends $70 / 7 = $10 per day.\n\n2. **Wooden Action Figures:**\n   - Each figure costs $5 and he spends $10 per day from Sunday to Wednesday.\n   - Purchases 2 wooden figures per day for 4 days: 2 * 4 = 8 wooden figures.\n\n3. **Plastic Action Figures:**\n   - Each figure costs $2.5 and he spends $10 per day from Thursday to Saturday.\n   - Purchases 4 plastic figures per day for 3 days: 4 * 3 = 12 plastic figures.\n\n4. **Total Verification:**\n   - Total figures: 8 (wooden) + 12 (plastic) = 20 action figures.\n\nFinal answer: \\(\\boxed{20}\\)"
