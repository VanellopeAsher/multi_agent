Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's determine how many muffin crayons Kate was able to make and then calculate how much each one sold for.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of crayons Kate had:**\n   - She had 3 boxes, each containing 64 crayons.\n   - Total crayons \\( = 3 \\times 64 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the number of muffin crayons made:**\n   - Each muffin crayon is made by melting 8 small pieces of crayons.\n   - Number of muffin crayons \\( = \\frac{\\text{Total crayons}}{8} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the selling price of each muffin crayon:**\n   - If she made $36 in total by selling all muffin crayons, then the price per muffin crayon is \\( = \\frac{\\text{Total money made}}{\\text{Number of muffin crayons}} \\).\n\nNow, let's write the code to compute these values using Python.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for handling exact calculations\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate total crayons\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of muffin crayons\nmuffin_crayons = total_crayons // 8  # use integer division because we need a whole number of muffin crayons\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the selling price of each muffin crayon\ntotal_money_made = 36\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(total_money_made, muffin_crayons)\n\n# Output the result using a fractional representation\nprint(\"The price of each muffin crayon is:\", price_per_muffin)\n```\nNow, let's verify the steps to ensure accuracy.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Total Crayons Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total crayons} = 3 \\times 64 = 192\n   \\]\n   This calculation is correct.\n\n2. **Number of Muffin Crayons:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of muffin crayons} = \\frac{192}{8} = 24\n   \\]\n   This result is consistent with the number of crayons and process used.\n\n3. **Selling Price Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price per muffin crayon} = \\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   This fraction simplifies correctly to \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) or 1.5.\n\nThe solution is verified, and thus the price of each muffin crayon is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\\)"
