Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJenna shares her living space with four other people. The monthly cost for electricity in their shared home is $100. If they split the cost evenly, what would be the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine each roommate's annual contribution towards the electricity bill.\n\n**Key idea:** \nEach roommate will pay an equal share of the monthly electricity bill, and this needs to be calculated for the entire year (12 months).\n\n**Steps to solve the problem:**\n\n1. Calculate the monthly contribution of each roommate.\n2. Calculate the annual contribution by multiplying the monthly contribution by 12 months.\n\nLet's solve this using a **Direct Python Solution** approach.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the monthly electricity bill and the number of people sharing it\nmonthly_bill = 100\npeople = 5\n\n# Calculate each person's monthly contribution\nmonthly_contribution = monthly_bill / people\n\n# Calculate the annual contribution for each person\nannual_contribution = monthly_contribution * 12\n\n# Use Rational for the sake of following the instructions to use fractions\nfinal_contribution = Rational(annual_contribution)\n\n# Print the output in the desired format, using fractions\nprint(final_contribution)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Monthly Contribution Verification**\n   - Total bill = $100\n   - Number of people = 5\n   - Each person's monthly share = $100 / 5 = $20\n\n2. **Annual Contribution Verification**\n   - Monthly share = $20\n   - Total months = 12\n   - Annual share = $20 * 12 = $240\n\nThe calculations are straightforward and consistent. Thus, each roommate's annual contribution towards the electricity bill is $\\boxed{240}$."
