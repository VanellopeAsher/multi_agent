      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rows of each type of tulip Jackson can plant, given the number of tulips he has and the number of tulips that fit in each row. Then, we calculate the total number of rows by accounting for the yellow rows that are added between each row of red and blue tulips.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n\n1. **Red Tulips**: Jackson has 36 red tulips, and he can fit 6 red tulips in a row.\n2. **Blue Tulips**: Jackson has 24 blue tulips, and he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.\n3. **Yellow Tulips**: Every time Jackson plants a row of red or blue tulips, he adds a row of yellow tulips, using 5 yellow tulips per row. He has 30 yellow tulips.\n\n### Steps to Solution:\n\n1. Calculate the number of rows of red tulips.\n2. Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips.\n3. Determine how many yellow tulip rows he can plant (this matches the number of red and blue rows since he adds yellow rows between red and blue rows).\n4. Compute the total number of rows.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Given data\ntotal_red_tulips = 36\nred_per_row = 6\n\ntotal_blue_tulips = 24\nblue_per_row = 8\n\ntotal_yellow_tulips = 30\nyellow_per_row = 5\n\n# Calculate number of rows for each type\nnum_red_rows = total_red_tulips // red_per_row\nnum_blue_rows = total_blue_tulips // blue_per_row\n\n# Rows with yellow tulips are placed between each red and blue row\n# Sum the rows of red and blue tulips to get how many yellow rows are needed\ntotal_primary_rows = num_red_rows + num_blue_rows\n\n# The number of rows of yellow tulips Jackson can plant with the 30 available tulips\n# Each yellow row requires 5 tulips\nnum_yellow_rows = total_yellow_tulips // yellow_per_row\n\n# The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant\n# He places one yellow row between each red and blue row\ntotal_rows = total_primary_rows + num_yellow_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Red Rows**: \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) rows\n- **Blue Rows**: \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\) rows\n- **Total \"Primary\" Rows**: 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9\n- **Yellow Rows**: \\( \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\) rows\n\nJackson adds a yellow row after each primary row, effectively meaning 9 yellow rows would be needed, but he can only make 6 given the tulips. So while he wants to plant 9 yellow rows (one after each red and blue), he only has enough for 6. Thus, the total number of rows he can plant is:\n\n\\[ 9 \\text{ (primary rows)} + 6 \\text{ (yellow rows)} = 15 \\text{ rows} \\]\n\nThus, Jackson plants a total of \\( \\boxed{15} \\) rows."
