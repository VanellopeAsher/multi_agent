Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLeah just got a new kitten. Neutering him cost $150, his 2 vaccines costs $30 each, and the kitten broke 3 vases that cost $15 each. How much has the puppy cost so far?"

Calculate the cost of neutering.\n2. Calculate the total cost of vaccinations.\n3. Calculate the total cost of broken vases.\n4. Sum all individual costs to get the total amount spent.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Neutering cost\nneutering_cost = 150\n\n# Each vaccine costs $30, and there are 2 vaccines\nvaccine_cost = 30 * 2\n\n# Each broken vase costs $15, and 3 vases were broken\nvases_cost = 15 * 3\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = neutering_cost + vaccine_cost + vases_cost\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we can determine the total amount Leah has spent on her kitten.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Neutering Cost**: $150 (given)\n2. **Vaccine Cost**: \n   - Each vaccine = $30\n   - Number of vaccines = 2\n   - Total cost for vaccines = $30 \\(\\times\\) 2 = $60\n3. **Broken Vases Cost**:\n   - Each vase = $15\n   - Number of vases = 3\n   - Total cost for vases = $15 \\(\\times\\) 3 = $45\n4. **Total Cost**:\n   - Sum up all components: $150 + $60 + $45 = $255\n\nThe calculations have been verified as correct, so Leah has spent a total of \boxed{255}."
