Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16. What will be her age after 4 years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine Charmaine's current age based on the information provided, and then calculate her age after 4 years. Let's break down the problem using a step-by-step approach.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Charmaine's Current Age**\n\nThe problem states that in 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16. Therefore, we need to find out her current age. We can set up an equation for this:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current age of Charmaine} + 12 = 16 \\]\n\nSolving for Charmaine's current age:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current age of Charmaine} = 16 - 12 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Charmaine's Age After 4 Years**\n\nOnce we have Charmaine's current age, we need to calculate what her age will be after 4 years. This can be done by adding 4 to her current age.\n\nLet's carry out these calculations in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Charmaine's current age\ncurrent_age_charmaine = 16 - 12\n\n# Calculate Charmaine's age after 4 years\nage_after_4_years = current_age_charmaine + 4\n\n# Print the result\nprint(age_after_4_years)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. We establish that Charmaine's current age is calculated by subtracting 12 from 16, which gives \\( 16 - 12 = 4 \\).\n2. To find Charmaine's age after 4 years, we add 4 to her current age: \\( 4 + 4 = 8 \\).\n\nThe calculations are verified step by step:\n\n- Current age: 4 (since in 12 years, she will be 16)\n- Age after 4 years: 4 (current age) + 4 = 8\n\nFinally, the answer to the question, \"What will be her age after 4 years?\" is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
