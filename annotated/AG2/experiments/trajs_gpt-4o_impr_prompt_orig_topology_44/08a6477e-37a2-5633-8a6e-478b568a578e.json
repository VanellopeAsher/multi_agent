Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a step-by-step approach. The main goal is to determine the number of bandages used on the first day.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Define variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of bandages used on the first day.\n  \n2. **Calculate the number of bandages used:**\n   - On the first day, they used \\( x \\) bandages.\n   - On the second day, they used \\( x - 10 \\) bandages.\n   - On the third day, they used \\( \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\) bandages (half a pack).\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of bandages available:**\n   - Initially, they had 19 bandages.\n   - They ordered 1 pack of 50 bandages on the first day.\n   - They ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages each on the third day.\n   - Therefore, the total bandages = \\( 19 + 1 \\times 50 + 2 \\times 50 = 169 \\).\n\n4. **Set up the equation:**\n\n   Given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, the total bandages used over the three days is:\n\n   \\[\n   169 - 78 = x + (x - 10) + 25\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying gives:\n\n   \\[\n   91 = 2x + 15\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   Let's solve the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   91 = 2x + 15\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract 15 from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   91 - 15 = 2x\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   76 = 2x\n   \\]\n\n   Divide both sides by 2:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 38\n   \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Calculate the total used with calculated \\( x \\):**\n   - First day: 38 bandages.\n   - Second day: \\( 38 - 10 = 28 \\) bandages.\n   - Third day: 25 bandages.\n\n2. **Total used is \\( 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 \\)**.\n\n3. **Check leftover:**\n   - Total bandages available: 169.\n   - Total used: 91.\n   - Leftover: \\( 169 - 91 = 78 \\).\n\nThe leftover matches with the given condition, confirming our solution is correct.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\] \n\nThis is the number of bandages used on the first day."
