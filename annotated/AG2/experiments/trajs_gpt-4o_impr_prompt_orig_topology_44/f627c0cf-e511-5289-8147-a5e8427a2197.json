Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for a period of time, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?"

      "content": "To find Mark's initial weight, we can use a straightforward algebraic approach. We know the following information:\n\n- Mark lost 10 pounds per month.\n- His final weight was 70 pounds.\n- We need to determine his initial weight.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( x \\) as the initial weight.\n- \\( m \\) as the number of months he was losing weight.\n\nThe weight loss equation can be expressed as:\n\\[ \nx - 10m = 70 \n\\]\n\nTo find his initial weight, we need to solve for \\( x \\). If we knew the number of months \\( m \\), we could easily calculate \\( x \\). However, since the number of months is not given, we can only represent \\( x \\) in terms of \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ \nx = 70 + 10m \n\\]\n\nSince we don't know \\( m \\) or have additional information to determine it, the solution is dependent on \\( m \\). However, because the problem is not fully constrained with a specific \\( m \\), we must acknowledge the problem is unsolvable as it stands.\n\nBased on the guideline for handling unsolvable problems due to missing data:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)"
