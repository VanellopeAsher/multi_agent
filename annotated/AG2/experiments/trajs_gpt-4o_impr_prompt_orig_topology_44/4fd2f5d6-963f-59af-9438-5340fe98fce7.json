Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost. If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, how much was the total cost?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need additional information about the DIY will's initial cost structure or other related costs being considered. The given information, \"A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost,\" does not specify the original cost or what percentage of costs is initially due to materials, unless there's a specific context or baseline figure implied.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the problem seems unsolvable due to missing data. We need the initial cost or the cost of materials before savings to proceed with further calculations. If this information becomes available, we can revisit the problem and provide a detailed solution.\n\nAs per the guidelines, since the problem is currently unsolvable due to missing data, we can express the outcome as:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)"
