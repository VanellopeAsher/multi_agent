Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nUpon the conclusion of the academic year, Kate requested her instructor for the 3 containers of 64 crayons that were all reduced to tiny fragments.

      "content": "To determine how much money Kate can earn from her crayon muffins, we need to first figure out how many muffins she can make from the given crayon fragments.\n\n### Key Idea:\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Fragments:**\n   - There are 3 containers of crayons.\n   - Each container has 64 crayons.\n   - Therefore, the total number of crayons = \\( 3 \\times 64 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Crayon Muffins:**\n   - Each muffin is made by fusing 8 fragments.\n   - Therefore, the number of muffins she can make = (Total number of fragments) / 8.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Earnings:**\n   - Each muffin is worth $1.50.\n   - Multiply the number of muffins by $1.50 to get the total earnings.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to handle any number formatting\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given values\ncontainers = 3\ncrayons_per_container = 64\nfragments_per_muffin = 8\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(3, 2)  # $1.50 as a fraction\n\n# Calculation\ntotal_fragments = containers * crayons_per_container\nnumber_of_muffins = total_fragments // fragments_per_muffin\ntotal_earnings = number_of_muffins * price_per_muffin\n\n# Print the result in fractional form (if any fractions exist)\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Check Total Number of Fragments:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\) fragments.\n\n2. **Check Number of Muffins:**\n   - \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\) muffins.\n\n3. **Check Total Earnings:**\n   - Each muffin is $1.50: \\(24 \\times 1.50 = 36\\).\n\nSince each step checks out logically and mathematically, I can confidently present the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]"
