Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?"

However, the problem does not provide the length of the shark, which makes it impossible to compute the precise percentage.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- We have two remoras, each 6 inches long.\n- The combined length of the remoras is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) inches.\n- To find the percentage of the shark's length that 12 inches represents, we need the shark's total length, which is missing.\n\nAs the problem is currently unsolvable due to the missing data (the shark's length), we will return the result as unsolvable.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let the length of the shark be denoted by L_shark\nL_shark = symbols('L_shark')\n\n# 12 inches is the combined length of the remoras\nL_remoras_combined = 12\n\n# We need the equation for the percentage of shark's length\n# Percentage = (L_remoras_combined / L_shark) * 100\n\n# Since L_shark is missing, we cannot solve for this\n# Thus, the problem is unsolvable as given\nprint('The problem is unsolvable with the current information provided.')\n```\n\n### Verification\nWe have correctly identified that the necessary data (the length of the shark) is missing. Without this information, calculating the requested percentage is impossible.\n\nThe final conclusion is:\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)"
