Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle, knowing the rate at which he drinks water.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes.\n2. Solving a normal sudoku puzzle takes John 30 minutes.\n3. Solving an extreme sudoku takes 3 times the duration of solving a normal sudoku.\n\n### Approach:\n- First, calculate the time it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku.\n- Second, determine the number of 30-minute intervals within that time to figure out how many bottles he drinks.\n\n### Calculations:\n1. Time for solving an extreme sudoku:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Extreme Sudoku Time} = 3 \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Number of bottles of water:\n   Since John drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, we need to find how many 30-minute intervals fit into 90 minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Bottles} = \\frac{90 \\text{ minutes}}{30 \\text{ minutes per bottle}} = 3 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this process briefly and confirm our solution.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. Time to solve an extreme sudoku: Correctly calculated as 90 minutes.\n2. Number of 30-minute intervals in 90 minutes: Correctly calculated as 3 intervals.\n\nHence, John drinks \\(\\boxed{3}\\) bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku."
