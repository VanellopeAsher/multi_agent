Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces certain inches long. At last she obtains 8 pieces, then how many inches was each piece?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of each piece of wire in inches.\n\n**Key idea:** \nConvert the total length of wire into inches and divide it by the number of pieces to find the length of each piece.\n\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n1. **Convert the wire length from feet to inches:**\n   - We know that 1 foot = 12 inches.\n   - Therefore, 4 feet = \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) inches.\n\n2. **Divide the total length by the number of pieces:**\n   - Tracy has 8 pieces in total.\n   - The length of each piece will be \\( \\frac{48}{8} \\) inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the length of each piece:**\n\nLet's calculate using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the length of each piece\ntotal_length_inches = 4 * 12\nnumber_of_pieces = 8\n\nlength_per_piece = total_length_inches / number_of_pieces\n\n# Print the result using the print function\nprint(length_per_piece)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code gives the result, which is the length of each piece in inches. Let's present the final answer:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. We converted 4 feet to 48 inches correctly since \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\).\n2. Dividing 48 inches by 8 pieces indeed gives 6 inches per piece (\\( \\frac{48}{8} = 6\\)).\n\nThus, the solution is verified and the length of each piece is \\(\\boxed{6}\\) inches."
