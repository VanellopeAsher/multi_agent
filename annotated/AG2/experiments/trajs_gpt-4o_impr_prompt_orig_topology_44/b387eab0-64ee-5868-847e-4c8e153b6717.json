Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we will follow the direct Python solution approach using sympy for calculations while adhering to your specified format. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to calculate the total price someone will pay for 10 gallons of gas, taking into account cashback and a discount coupon.\n\n### Key Idea:\n1. **Calculate the total price before discounts or cashback:** Multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons.\n2. **Apply the cashback discount:** Multiply the cashback amount per gallon by the number of gallons and subtract it from the total price.\n3. **Apply the coupon discount:** Apply the 10% discount to the price after cashback.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational\n\n# Variables\nprice_per_gallon = Rational(3, 1)  # $3.00 per gallon\ncashback_per_gallon = Rational(20, 100)  # $0.20 cashback per gallon\ndiscount_percentage = Rational(10, 100)  # 10% discount\ngallons_bought = 10\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial total price without discounts\ninitial_total_price = price_per_gallon * gallons_bought\n\n# Step 2: Apply cashback\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons_bought\nprice_after_cashback = initial_total_price - total_cashback\n\n# Step 3: Apply coupon discount\ndiscount_amount = price_after_cashback * discount_percentage\nfinal_price = price_after_cashback - discount_amount\n\n# Output the final price\nprint(final_price)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate Initial Total Price:**\n    - \\( \\text{Initial Price} = 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times 3.00 \\text{ dollars/gallon} = 30.00 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n    \n2. **Calculate Cashback:**\n    - \\( \\text{Cashback} = 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times 0.20 \\text{ dollars/gallon} = 2.00 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n\n3. **Price after Cashback:**\n    - \\( \\text{Price after Cashback} = 30.00 \\text{ dollars} - 2.00 \\text{ dollars} = 28.00 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n\n4. **Apply Discount:**\n    - \\( \\text{Discount} = 28.00 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.10 = 2.80 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n    - \\( \\text{Final Price} = 28.00 \\text{ dollars} - 2.80 \\text{ dollars} = 25.20 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n\nThis step-by-step reasoning confirms the correctness of our calculation. Therefore, the final price paid is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{25.20}\\)"
