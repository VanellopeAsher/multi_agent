Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up several packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many water balloons were thrown during Jolene's water balloon fight. \n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Total Balloons Calculation**: \n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of balloons they initially filled.\n   - Since each pack contains 30 balloons, the total number of balloons initially is \\( 30x \\).\n\n2. **Balloons Remaining**:\n   - By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons remain unthrown.\n\n3. **Balloons Thrown**:\n   - The number of balloons thrown is the initial total minus the remaining balloons: \\( 30x - 12 \\).\n\nTo determine how many balloons were thrown, we need to know the value of \\( x \\) (the number of packs). However, since \\( x \\) is not provided in the problem statement, it seems there might be missing information (the number of packs \\( x \\)). \n\nTherefore, we cannot compute the exact number of balloons thrown without this information.\n\nGiven the missing value, our response would be:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None}} \\]\n\nThis indicates that the solution depends on an unknown number of packs."
