Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

      "content": "To find out how many $10 bills Ali originally had, we can break down the problem step by step and solve it using Python. Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Total Amount of Money**: \n   - Let the number of $10 bills Ali has be \\( x \\).\n   - Ali also has six $20 bills.\n   - Total amount in dollars: \\( 10x + 6 \\times 20 \\).\n\n2. **Giving Half to Sister**: \n   - After giving half to his sister, Ali keeps half, which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) \\).\n\n3. **Buying Dinner**:\n   - Ali spends \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the remaining money after giving half to his sister.\n   - He spends this on dinner, leaving him with $32.\n\n4. **Formulating the Equation**:\n   - Remaining amount after giving half: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) \\).\n   - Amount spent on dinner: \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) \\).\n   - Amount left after dinner: $32.\n\nNow we'll set up the equation and solve it for \\( x \\).\n\n### Solving the Equation\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\n# (1/2 * (10x + 120)) - (3/5 * (1/2 * (10x + 120))) = 32\ntotal_money = 10*x + 120\nafter_giving_sister = total_money / 2\nafter_dinner = after_giving_sister - (3/5) * after_giving_sister\n\n# The equation states the amount left after buying dinner is 32\nequation = Eq(after_dinner, 32)\n\n# Solve the equation\nnum_of_10_dollar_bills = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Number of $10 bills Ali originally had:\", num_of_10_dollar_bills[0])\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of $10 bills Ali originally had. Let's verify and solve the equation step by step manually for better understanding.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Calculate total money: \\( 10x + 120 \\).\n2. Money kept after giving half: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) \\).\n3. Money after buying dinner: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) - \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) = 32 \n   \\]\n4. Solve: \n   \\[\n   (1 - \\frac{3}{5}) \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) = 32 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) = 32 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times (10x + 120) = 32 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10x + 120 = 160 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10x = 40 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 4 \n   \\]\n\nThus, Ali originally had 4 $10 bills.\n\n\\(\\boxed{4}\\)"
