Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 2000 helmets, calculate the total number of items Dominick saw."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of item Dominick saw in the changing room: robots, helmets, and footballs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Identify the number of helmets**:\n   - Dominick saw 2000 helmets. This is a given in the problem.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of robots**:\n   - According to the problem, there are half as many robots as helmets.\n   - Therefore, the number of robots is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{robots} = \\frac{2000}{2} = 1000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of footballs**:\n   - There are half as many helmets as footballs.\n   - Therefore, the number of footballs is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{footballs} = 2 \\times 2000 = 4000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of items**:\n   - We sum up the number of robots, helmets, and footballs to find the total number of items:\n     \\[\n     \\text{total items} = 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000\n     \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Verify the number of robots**:\n   - We correctly calculated half of 2000, which gives us 1000 robots.\n\n2. **Verify the number of footballs**:\n   - Since helmets are half the number of footballs, doubling 2000 gives us 4000 footballs.\n\n3. **Verify the total number of items**:\n   - Adding together: 1000 robots + 2000 helmets + 4000 footballs equals 7000 items.\n\nThe calculations are verified, and they align with the problem conditions. Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7000} \\]"
