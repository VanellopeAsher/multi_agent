  "problem": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's employ a step-by-step approach to determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford her purchases.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of Purchases:**\n   - Jacket cost: $120\n   - 2 pairs of shoes cost: \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\)\n   - Total cost: \\(120 + 200 = 320\\)\n\n2. **Calculate Sara's Current Savings:**\n   - She had $100 saved initially.\n   - She earned \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) from babysitting.\n   - Total current savings: \\(100 + 50 = 150\\)\n\n3. **Determine Additional Money Needed:**\n   - Total needed: \\(320\\)\n   - Total current savings: \\(150\\)\n   - Additional money needed: \\(320 - 150 = 170\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Times She Must Mow the Lawn:**\n   - She earns $10 each time she mows the lawn.\n   - Let \\(x\\) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn.\n   - Equation to solve: \\(10x = 170\\)\n   - Solving for \\(x\\): \\(x = \\frac{170}{10} = 17\\)\n\nThus, Sara must mow the lawn 17 times to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify each step:\n\n- Total cost of jacket and shoes: $320\n- Initial savings: $100\n- Earnings from babysitting: $50\n- Total current savings: $150\n- Additional needed: $170\n- Earnings per lawn mow: $10\n- Times to mow lawn: \\(\\frac{170}{10} = 17\\)\n\nEach calculation checks out correctly. Therefore, the solution is valid.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."
