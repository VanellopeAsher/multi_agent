Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn goes to the market with $10,000 in his pocket. He buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. He also considers buying a horse for $2000 but decides against it. How much money did he spend at the market?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money John spent when buying the animals.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Compute the Cost of Goats:**\n   - John buys 3 goats at $500 each.\n   - Total cost for goats = \\( 3 \\times 500 = 1500 \\).\n\n2. **Compute the Cost of Cows:**\n   - John buys 2 cows at $1500 each.\n   - Total cost for cows = \\( 2 \\times 1500 = 3000 \\).\n\n3. **Sum the Total Cost:**\n   - Total amount spent = Cost of goats + Cost of cows = \\( 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \\).\n\nNow, we'll write a Python script to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the cost of goats\ncost_goats = 3 * 500\n\n# Calculate the cost of cows\ncost_cows = 2 * 1500\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_goats + cost_cows\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify each calculation:\n\n1. **Cost of Goats Verification:**\n   - \\( 3 \\times 500 = 1500 \\) (Correct)\n\n2. **Cost of Cows Verification:**\n   - \\( 2 \\times 1500 = 3000 \\) (Correct)\n\n3. **Total Cost Verification:**\n   - \\( 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \\) (Correct)\n\nThrough verification, each calculation checks out correctly.\n\nThus, John spent a total of \\( \\boxed{4500} \\) dollars at the market."
