Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another inches in the third week and the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inces tall. How many inches did the beanstalk grow in the third week?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how much the beanstalk grew during the third week.\n\n### Key Concept\nThe problem states that the beanstalk:\n1. Was 3 inches tall after the first week.\n2. Doubled in height during the second week.\n3. Grew a certain number of inches during the third week and ended up being 10 inches tall.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the Height After the Second Week:**\n   - After doubling its initial height of 3 inches, the beanstalk's height after the second week would be \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches.\n\n2. **Determine the Growth in the Third Week:**\n   - We know that the beanstalk is 10 inches tall after the third week.\n   - If it was 6 inches tall after the second week, the growth during the third week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Growth in third week} = \\text{Height after third week} - \\text{Height after second week}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Growth in third week} = 10 - 6 = 4 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify our solution:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Week 1: 3 inches.\n- Week 2: 6 inches (doubled from week 1).\n- Week 3: 10 inches (given final height).\n\nThe calculation for the growth in the third week matches the given conditions: \\(10 - 6 = 4\\) inches.\n\nThus, the beanstalk grew 4 inches during the third week.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
