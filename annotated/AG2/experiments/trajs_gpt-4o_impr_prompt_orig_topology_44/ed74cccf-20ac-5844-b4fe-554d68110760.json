Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students, given the participation in different sports.\n\n**Steps to solve the problem:**\n\n1. **Identify the Students Playing Each Sport:**\n   - Tennis players: 6 students.\n   - Volleyball players: twice the number of tennis players. Therefore, the number of volleyball players is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) students.\n   - Soccer players: The total includes some boys and 22 girls. We will denote the number of boys as \\(b\\), so the total number of soccer players is \\(b + 22\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Students:**\n   Since each student participates in only one group, the total number of students is the sum of students playing each sport:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Students} = \\text{Tennis players} + \\text{Volleyball players} + \\text{Soccer players}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express the Total Number of Students as a Function of \\(b\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Students} = 6 + 12 + (b + 22)\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the expression, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Students} = 6 + 12 + b + 22 = 40 + b\n   \\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify the number of boys \\(b\\) in soccer, we cannot calculate a definitive total number of students. Without additional information, the problem is unsolvable for a precise total.\n\nBased on the framework provided, if the problem cannot be solved due to missing data, we should report:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\) \n\nThis indicates that a specific numerical answer cannot be determined with the provided information."
