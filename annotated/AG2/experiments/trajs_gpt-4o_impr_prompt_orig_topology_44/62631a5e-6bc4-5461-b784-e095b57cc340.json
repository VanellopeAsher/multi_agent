Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAmora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 150 more corn chips than the number the others got. If Amora and Lainey got 700 corn chips each, how many corn chips were there altogether?"

We'll use this information to calculate the total.\n\nLet's break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Determine individual portions:**\n   - Amora received 700 corn chips.\n   - Lainey also received 700 corn chips.\n   - Collins received 700 + 150 corn chips.\n\n2. **Calculate the total:**\n   - Add up all the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.\n\nLet's implement this using Python to compute the total number of corn chips.\n\n```python\n# Given data\namora_chips = 700\nlainey_chips = 700\ncollins_chips = amora_chips + 150  # Collins got 150 more than Amora and Lainey\n\n# Total number of corn chips\ntotal_chips = amora_chips + lainey_chips + collins_chips\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_chips)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we can determine the total number of corn chips.\n\nNow let's implement it and find the result."
