Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity.

We need to compute how much Walter's lawyer will donate based on the total amount collected from the neighbors, the online fund, and an additional $120 from a friend.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.\n2. Include the extra $120 contributed by Walter's friend.\n3. Calculate the lawyer's contribution, which is three times the total amount everyone else donates (including the friend).\n4. Output the result using the specified format.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Step 1: Define the amounts\nneighbors_donation = 300\nonline_fund_donation = 1200\nfriend_donation = 120\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total donation excluding the lawyer\ntotal_donations_excluding_lawyer = neighbors_donation + online_fund_donation + friend_donation\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the lawyer's donation\nlawyer_donation = 3 * total_donations_excluding_lawyer\n\n# Step 4: Output the result\nprint(\"Walter's lawyer is going to contribute:\", lawyer_donation)\n```\n\nLet's break down the steps and ensure correctness.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Individual Donations:**\n\n   - Neighbors: $300\n   - Online fund: $1200\n   - Friend: $120\n   \n   Total = \\(300 + 1200 + 120 = 1620\\)\n\n2. **Lawyer's Contribution:**\n\n   The lawyer agrees to donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors, online fund, and the friend:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lawyer's Donation} = 3 \\times 1620 = 4860\n   \\]\n\nThe verification confirms our computed amount.
