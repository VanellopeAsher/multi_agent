Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has and determine how many cards are given to the students. Then, we will find out how many students received the cards.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards each.\n   - She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards each.\n   - She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Cards Miss Maria Keeps:**\n   - Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Cards Given to Students:**\n   - Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps from the total number of cards.\n\n4. **Calculate How Many Students Received the Cards:**\n   - Each student gets 10 cards.\n   - Calculate the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to the students by 10.\n\nWe will use Python and the sympy library to ensure calculations use fractions and avoid any floating-point arithmetic inaccuracies.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\nsoccer_cards = 30\n\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards + soccer_cards\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of cards given to the students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of students\nstudents = cards_given_to_students / 10\n\n# Display the result\nprint(students)\n```\n\nNow, let's solve the problem using the structured approach.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Cards:**\n   - Basketball cards: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\)\n   - Baseball cards: \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\)\n   - Soccer cards: \\(30\\)\n   - Total cards: \\(150 + 200 + 30 = 380\\)\n\n2. **Number of Cards Miss Maria Keeps:**\n   - \\(50\\)\n\n3. **Number of Cards Given to Students:**\n   - \\(380 - 50 = 330\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Students:**\n   - Total cards given to students: \\(330\\)\n   - Cards per student: \\(10\\)\n   - Number of students: \\(330 / 10 = 33\\)\n\nTherefore, the number of students who received the cards is \\( \\boxed{33} \\)."
