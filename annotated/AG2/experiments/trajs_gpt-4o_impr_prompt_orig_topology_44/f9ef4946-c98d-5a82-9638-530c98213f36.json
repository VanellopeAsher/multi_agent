Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework.

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many hours Frankie watched TV in a week, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV each day and sum it up.\n\nHere's how we can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Time Spent Watching TV Each Day:**\n   - **Monday:** 1-hour episode.\n   - **Tuesday:** 1-hour episode.\n   - **Wednesday:** Three 30-minute episodes, which equals \\( \\frac{3 \\times 30}{60} = 1.5 \\) hours.\n   - **Thursday:** 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which totals \\( 1 + \\frac{30}{60} = 1.5 \\) hours.\n   - **Friday:** Two 1-hour episodes, totaling \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Hours Spent Watching TV in the Week:**\n   - Monday: 1 hour\n   - Tuesday: 1 hour\n   - Wednesday: 1.5 hours\n   - Thursday: 1.5 hours\n   - Friday: 2 hours\n\n3. **Sum Up the Hours:**\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute the total hours:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of total hours Frankie watched TV\ntotal_hours = 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2\nprint(f\"Total hours Frankie watched TV: {total_hours}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify each calculation step-by-step to ensure accuracy:\n\n- **Monday and Tuesday:** Clearly, 1 hour each day.\n- **Wednesday:** 3 episodes of 30 minutes each correctly add to 1.5 hours.\n- **Thursday:** 1 hour plus a 30-minute show is correctly 1.5 hours.\n- **Friday:** Two 1-hour episodes correctly sum to 2 hours.\n\nFinally, let's recompute the total:\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \\]\n\nI have calculated each part and verified correctness. Therefore, the total number of hours Frankie watched TV in the week is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{7}\\]"
