Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll go through the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Known Quantities**: \n   - There are 10 sisters, each aged 16.\n   - One brother is 12 years old.\n   - The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother.\n\n2. **Calculate the Older Brother's Age**:\n   Since the younger brother is 12, the older brother's age will be \\( 2 \\times 12 \\).\n\n3. **Compute Total Age**:\n   Add up the ages of the siblings: \n   - Total age of sisters: \\(10 \\times 16\\).\n   - Age of the younger brother: 12.\n   - Age of the older brother: calculated in step 2.\n\nLet's do these calculations in Python:\n\n```python\n# Import the sympy library for symbolic math operations\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the ages and number of siblings\nsister_age = 16\nnum_sisters = 10\nyounger_brother_age = 12\n\n# Calculate the older brother's age\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Calculate the total age of the sisters\ntotal_sister_age = num_sisters * sister_age\n\n# Calculate the total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\n# Output the total age using print\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the solution:\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. Calculate the ages:\n   - Total age of sisters = \\(10 \\times 16 = 160\\).\n   - Age of the younger brother = 12.\n   - Age of the older brother = \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\n2. Add the ages:\n   - Total age = 160 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 196.\n\nSince the computed total age is correct and the logic follows the problem constraints accurately, we can confidently report the result:\n\n\\(\\boxed{196}\\)"
