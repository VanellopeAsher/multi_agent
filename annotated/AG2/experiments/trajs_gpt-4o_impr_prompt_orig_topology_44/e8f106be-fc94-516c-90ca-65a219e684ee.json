Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is planning a birthday party and wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.

      "content": "**Key Idea or Concept:**\n\nThe problem involves calculating the length of crepe-paper streamers James needs to hang on his backyard fence, which is rectangular in shape. Since the streamers are only to be hung along the perimeter of the fence and not on the tree, we can disregard the tree when calculating the total length of streamers required.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Understand the Dimensions:**\n   - The backyard fence is a rectangle with dimensions 20 feet (long side) and 15 feet (short side).\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle:**\n   - The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n     \\]\n   - Here, Length = 20 feet, and Width = 15 feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Length of Streamers Needed:**\n   - Since the streamers are to be hung on the perimeter of the fence only, use the perimeter formula to determine the total length.\n\nUsing these steps, proceed to calculate the perimeter with Python:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library for formatting\nfrom sympy import Rational, simplify\n\n# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nlength = 20  # long side in feet\nwidth = 15   # short side in feet\n\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The total length of crepe paper needed is {perimeter} feet.\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Verify dimensions are correctly noted: 20 feet and 15 feet.\n- **Step 2:** Verify formula for the perimeter:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n- **Step 3:** Confirm that the calculation was executed correctly in Python.\n\nAfter verifying the calculations are correct and the perimeter is 70 feet, the solution is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{70}\\)"
