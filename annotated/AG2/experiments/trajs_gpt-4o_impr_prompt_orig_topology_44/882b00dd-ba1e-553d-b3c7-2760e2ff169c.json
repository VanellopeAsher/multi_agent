Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings for both Billy and Sally after 20 hours of work and then find the difference between their earnings. Let's follow the problem-solving approach outlined above.\n\n### Key Idea\nThe key to this problem is determining the hourly rates for both Billy and Sally at the end of the specified period and then calculating their respective total earnings for 20 hours of work. Finally, we compare the two earnings to find the difference.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Billy's Salary Calculation:**\n   - Initially, Billy's hourly rate: $10\n   - Raise after 2 months: $0.50, new rate: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50\n   - Raise on the first anniversary: $1.00, new rate: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50\n\n2. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**\n   - Initial rate ($0.50 more than Billy's starting rate): $10 + $0.50 = $10.50\n   - Raise after 2 months: $0.50, new rate: $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00\n\n3. **Calculate Earnings for 20 Hours:**\n   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours at $11.50 per hour: \\(20 \\times 11.50\\)\n   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours at $11.00 per hour: \\(20 \\times 11.00\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Difference in earnings = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings\n\n### Calculation Using Python\n```python\n# Calculation using Python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Rates\nbilly_final_rate = 11.50\nsally_final_rate = 11.00\n\n# Earnings for 20 hours\nbilly_earnings = 20 * billy_final_rate\nsally_earnings = 20 * sally_final_rate\n\n# Difference\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Print the result\nprint(Rational(difference).limit_denominator(1))\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\nLet's verify each step:\n- After the raises and one year period, Billy's rate is correctly calculated: $11.50.\n- Sally's rate after two months was correctly calculated: $11.00.\n- We correctly calculated the earnings for 20 hours for both Billy and Sally based on their final rates.\n- We subtracted Sally's earnings from Billy's to find the difference.\n\n100% confident that the calculations are right.\n\n### Final Result\nBilly earns \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars more than Sally for 20 hours of work."
