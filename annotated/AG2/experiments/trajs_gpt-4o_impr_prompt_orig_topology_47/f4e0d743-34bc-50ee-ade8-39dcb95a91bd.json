Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total yearly cost for Madeline's dog based on the given expenses. Let's break down the problem step by step and use Python to perform the calculations where necessary.\n\n### Key Idea:\n\nMadeline's total expenses are comprised of regular weekly and monthly costs. We will:\n- Calculate the weekly expenses and scale them to a yearly figure.\n- Add monthly and bi-monthly expenses to this amount.\n- Use Python and sympy to ensure all calculations are in exact terms, using fractions if needed.\n\n### Breakdown of Expenses:\n\n1. **Weekly Costs:**\n   - Food: $25 per week. With 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year, this amounts to \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) weeks.\n   \n2. **Monthly Costs:**\n   - Treats: $20 per month.\n   - Medicine: $100 per month.\n   - Special Shampoo: $15 per month.\n\n3. **Bi-monthly Costs:**\n   - Toy: $10 every two months, which means $10 for every second month, or $60 for 12 months.\n\n### Calculation Using Python\n\nWe'll use Python for calculating the total yearly expenses.\n\n```python\n# Using Python to calculate yearly expenses\n\n# Calculate yearly expenses for weekly cost (food)\nweekly_food_cost = 25  # dollars\nweeks_in_year = 48  # 4 weeks per month * 12 months\nyearly_food_expense = weekly_food_cost * weeks_in_year\n\n# Calculate yearly expenses for monthly costs\nmonthly_treats_cost = 20  # dollars\nmonthly_medicine_cost = 100  # dollars\nmonthly_shampoo_cost = 15  # dollars\n\nyearly_treats_expense = monthly_treats_cost * 12\nyearly_medicine_expense = monthly_medicine_cost * 12\nyearly_shampoo_expense = monthly_shampoo_cost * 12\n\n# Calculate yearly expenses for bi-monthly toy\nbi_monthly_toy_cost = 10  # dollars every 2 months\nyearly_toy_expense = bi_monthly_toy_cost * 6  # since there are 6 sets of 2 months in a year\n\n# Total yearly expense\ntotal_yearly_expense = (\n    yearly_food_expense +\n    yearly_treats_expense +\n    yearly_medicine_expense +\n    yearly_shampoo_expense +\n    yearly_toy_expense\n)\n\n# Print the total yearly expense\nprint(total_yearly_expense)\n```\n\n### Solution\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- **Yearly Food Cost:** \\(25 \\times 48 = 1200\\) dollars.\n- **Yearly Treats Cost:** \\(20 \\times 12 = 240\\) dollars.\n- **Yearly Medicine Cost:** \\(100 \\times 12 = 1200\\) dollars.\n- **Yearly Shampoo Cost:** \\(15 \\times 12 = 180\\) dollars.\n- **Yearly Toy Cost:** \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\) dollars.\n\nAdding these:\n\n\\[1200 + 240 + 1200 + 180 + 60 = 2880\\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Verification of each component cost:\n   - Weekly to yearly conversion is correct.\n   - Monthly costs scaled to yearly costs are accurate.\n   - Bi-monthly cost correctly calculated over the year.\n\n2. Ensure all costs are accounted for and properly summed.\n\nAfter verifying, the total yearly expenditure is \\( \\boxed{2880} \\) dollars."
