Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step process to determine the total number of unicorns in the world.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Information:**\n   - Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female.\n   - There are 6 female unicorns in Scotland.\n   - A third of the unicorns in the world are in the Scottish Highlands.\n\n2. **Calculating the Total Number of Scottish Unicorns:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of Scottish unicorns.\n   - \\( \\frac{2}{3}x = 6 \\) (since two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female and they total 6).\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   - Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:\n     \\[\n     2x = 18\n     \\]\n   - Dividing by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 9\n     \\]\n   - There are 9 unicorns in Scotland.\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Number of Unicorns Worldwide:**\n   - It is given that one-third of the world's unicorns live in Scotland.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the total number of unicorns in the world.\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{3}y = 9\\)\n\n5. **Solving for \\( y \\):**\n   - Multiplying both sides by 3 to solve for \\( y \\):\n     \\[\n     y = 27\n     \\]\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThus, there are \\( 27 \\) unicorns in total around the world.\n\n### Verification\n\n1. Verified that \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 = 6 \\), confirming the number of Scottish female unicorns.\n2. Checked that one-third of \\( 27 \\) is indeed \\( 9 \\), which matches the count of Scottish unicorns.\n3. Recalculation confirms accuracy, verifying each step was followed correctly.\n\nGiven the calculations are consistent and verified, the solution is correct.\n\n\\(\\boxed{27}\\) is the total number of unicorns in the world."
