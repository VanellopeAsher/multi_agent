Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "**Key Idea:** \nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many cards Miss Maria has in total, how many she decides to keep, and how many are given to the students. From there, we can calculate how many students there are based on the given distribution.\n\n**Solution Approach:** \nWe'll use a direct Python solution to carry out the calculations.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of basketball cards:** With `6 decks` and `25 cards` each, multiply to get the total.\n2. **Calculate the total number of baseball cards:** With `5 boxes` and `40 cards` each, multiply to get the total.\n3. **Add the two totals to find the combined number of cards Miss Maria has.**\n4. **Determine how many cards are given to her students:** Subtract the number of cards she kept from the total.\n5. **Calculate the number of students based on ten cards given to each student.**\n\nHere's the code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# import necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the number of cards per deck and box\nbasketball_cards_per_deck = 25\nbaseball_cards_per_box = 40\n\n# calculate total basketball and baseball cards\ntotal_basketball_cards = 6 * basketball_cards_per_deck\ntotal_baseball_cards = 5 * baseball_cards_per_box\n\n# total number of cards\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards\n\n# cards kept by Miss Maria\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# cards each student gets\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# calculate number of students using sympy\nstudents = symbols('students')\neq = Eq(cards_given_to_students, students * cards_per_student)\nnumber_of_students = solve(eq, students)[0]\n\n# print the result\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate total basketball cards: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n2. Calculate total baseball cards: \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\).\n3. Total cards Miss Maria has: \\(150 + 200 = 350\\).\n4. Cards kept: 50, so cards given = \\(350 - 50 = 300\\).\n5. Each student gets 10 cards, so number of students = \\(\\frac{300}{10} = 30\\).\n\nEach step checks out with the calculations. Therefore, the number of students Miss Maria has is \\(\\boxed{30}\\)."
