      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours. He then works double that duration on Wednesday. On Thursday, he puts in 2 hours less than his Wednesday's work hours. What is the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow a straightforward approach using basic arithmetic calculations. We can also use a Python script to automate this calculation and present the result in a structured manner.\n\nLet's begin by breaking down the problem:\n\n1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.\n2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works double the hours worked on Tuesday. Thus, Wednesday's hours are \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) hours.\n3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than what he worked on Wednesday, which amounts to \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) hours.\n\nWe want to compute the total number of hours Bruce worked from Tuesday to Thursday.\n\nUsing Python, we can calculate this efficiently:\n\n```python\n# Weâ€™re using basic arithmetic to compute the total hours Bruce worked over the three days\ntuesday_hours = 5\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# Calculate the total hours\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- **Tuesday**: 5 hours\n- **Wednesday**: Double the Tuesday hours, which are \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) hours\n- **Thursday**: 2 hours less than Wednesday, which is \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) hours\n\nAdding these up:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \\text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 8 \\text{ hours (Thursday)} = 23 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Bruce worked over these three days is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{23}\n\\]"
