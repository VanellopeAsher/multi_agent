      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJenna shares her living space with four other people. The monthly cost for electricity in their shared home is $100. If they split the cost evenly, what would be the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill, given that they equally share the monthly cost.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n- The monthly cost of electricity for the shared home is $100.\n- There are five people living in the house, including Jenna.\n- The cost is divided evenly among the five roommates.\n\n### Steps to Solution\n1. **Calculate the Monthly Cost per Roommate:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Cost per Roommate} = \\frac{\\text{Total Monthly Cost}}{\\text{Number of Roommates}} = \\frac{100}{5}\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate the Annual Cost per Roommate:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual Cost per Roommate} = \\text{Monthly Cost per Roommate} \\times 12\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python code with the specified requirements:\n\n```python\n# Importing the sympy library to use precise expressions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total monthly cost and number of people sharing the cost\ntotal_monthly_cost = 100\nnumber_of_roommates = 5\n\n# Monthly contribution per roommate\nmonthly_contribution_per_roommate = Rational(total_monthly_cost, number_of_roommates)\n\n# Annual contribution per roommate\nannual_contribution_per_roommate = monthly_contribution_per_roommate * 12\n\n# Output the result in the required format\nprint(annual_contribution_per_roommate)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Monthly Cost Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Cost per Roommate} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n   \\]\n   This matches the calculation in the code.\n\n2. **Annual Cost Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual Cost per Roommate} = 20 \\times 12 = 240\n   \\]\n   This confirms the calculation from the code.\n\nThus, each roommate must contribute \\(\\boxed{240}\\) annually towards the electricity bill."
