      "content": "**Problem-Solving Approach:**\n\nLet's model the situation mathematically using variables and equations to find the total number of animals Rick killed.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- Let \\( w \\) be the number of wolves killed last night.\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cougars killed last night.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following:\n1. \\( w + c = 10 \\) (total animals killed last night).\n\nFor today:\n- Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars: \\( w_{\\text{today}} = 3c_{\\text{today}} \\).\n- Rick killed three fewer cougars than last night: \\( c_{\\text{today}} = c - 3 \\).\n\nLet's find the total number of animals killed today:\n1. Calculate the number of wolves killed today using the expression for today's wolves: \\( w_{\\text{today}} \\).\n2. Calculate the number of cougars killed today: \\( c - 3 \\).\n\nWe'll substitute these expressions into the equations and solve.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nc = symbols('c', integer=True)  # cougars killed last night\nw = symbols('w', integer=True)  # wolves killed last night\n\n# Equation for last night\neq1 = Eq(w + c, 10)\n\n# Equation for today \n# 3 times as many wolves as cougars\nc_today = c - 3\nw_today = 3 * c_today\n\n# Substitute c_today into w_today\neq2 = Eq(w_today, 3 * c_today)\n\n# Solve the equations\nlast_night_solution = solve((eq1, Eq(w, 10 - c)), (w, c))\nw_last_night, c_last_night = last_night_solution[w], last_night_solution[c]\n\nc_today_value = c_last_night - 3\nw_today_value = 3 * c_today_value\n\n# Calculate total animals killed today\ntotal_animals_today = c_today_value + w_today_value\n\n# Total animals killed in both nights\ntotal_animals = w_last_night + c_last_night + total_animals_today\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_animals)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. Ensure the solution \\( w + c = 10 \\) is satisfied with the values found for last night, \\( w_{last\\_night} \\) and \\( c_{last\\_night} \\).\n2. Verify today's conditions match the descriptions given:\n   - \\( w_{today} = 3 \\times (c_{last\\_night} - 3) \\).\n   - Ensure the number of cougars today is three fewer than last night.\n3. Add all numbers correctly to ensure the sum total matches expectations for both last night and today.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nLet's finish the computation and print the result."
