Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we'll use the problem-solving approach that allows us to translate the scenario into a mathematical representation and solve it using Python.\n\n### Key Idea\nLet's start by breaking down the problem:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of flights made daily by the first aircraft.**\n   - We know that the second aircraft's 44 flights are half of the total flights made by the first aircraft. Thus, the total number of flights by the first aircraft can be calculated as \\( 2 \\times 44 = 88 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of flights to each destination by the first aircraft.**\n   - The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, which means:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flights to Greece} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88\n     \\]\n   - The remainder of the flights are divided evenly between France and Germany.\n\n3. **Determine the number of flights to France.**\n   - Once we know how many flights remain after Greece, we can find out how many go to France.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\nLet's implement this calculation in Python using the `sympy` library to handle fractions easily.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total flights by the first aircraft\ntotal_flights_first_aircraft = 2 * 44\n\n# Flights to Greece\nflights_to_greece = Rational(3, 4) * total_flights_first_aircraft\n\n# Remaining flights are divided between France and Germany\nremaining_flights = total_flights_first_aircraft - flights_to_greece\n\n# Flights to France (which is half of the remaining flights)\nflights_to_france = remaining_flights / 2\n\n# Print the number of flights to France\nprint(f\"Number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France: {flights_to_france}\")\n```\n\n### Verification\n1. **Total Flights Calculation**: \n   - Total flights by the first aircraft is \\( 2 \\times 44 = 88 \\). This is consistent with the given condition.\n  \n2. **Flights to Greece Calculation**:\n   - \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66 \\) flights to Greece.\n  \n3. **Remaining Flights**:\n   - The remaining flights after Greece are \\( 88 - 66 = 22 \\).\n\n4. **Flights to France and Germany**:\n   - The flights are evenly divided between France and Germany, so each receives \\( 22 / 2 = 11 \\) flights.\n\nThus, the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."
