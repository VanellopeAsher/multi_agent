Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "To determine how many hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes, we can use a simple ratio and proportion approach. Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Establish the Ratio:**\n   We know from the problem that 60 potatoes produce 360 hash browns.\n\n2. **Calculate the Rate:**\n   We can calculate the rate of hash browns produced per potato.\n   \n3. **Use the Rate to Calculate New Quantity:**\n   Using the rate determined from the first step, calculate how many hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes.\n\nNow, let's solve this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given values\npotatoes_initial = 60\nhash_browns_initial = 360\n\n# Calculate hash browns per potato\nrate = Rational(hash_browns_initial, potatoes_initial)\n\n# Number of potatoes we have\npotatoes_new = 960\n\n# Calculate new number of hash browns\nhash_browns_new = rate * potatoes_new\n\n# Output the result\nprint(hash_browns_new)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Calculate Rate:**\n   - Calculating the rate of hash browns per potato from the provided information: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Rate} = \\frac{360 \\text{ hash browns}}{60 \\text{ potatoes}} = 6 \\text{ hash browns per potato}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Rate:**\n   - For 960 potatoes:\n     \\[\n     960 \\text{ potatoes} \\times 6 \\text{ hash browns per potato} = 5760 \\text{ hash browns}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Verify Calculation:**\n   - The mathematical steps show that our rate was applied correctly to the new number of potatoes.\n\nAfter verification, we find that the calculations are consistent and correct. Thus, the final number of hash browns that can be made from 960 potatoes is \\(\\boxed{5760}\\)."
