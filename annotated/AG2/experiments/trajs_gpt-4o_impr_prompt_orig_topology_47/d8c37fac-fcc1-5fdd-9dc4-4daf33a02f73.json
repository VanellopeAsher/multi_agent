      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKatherine has 50 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece. How much will she spend filling all 50 hanging baskets?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of filling all 50 hanging baskets with the specified numbers of petunias and sweet potato vines. Here’s how we can approach the problem:\n\nKey Idea:\nCalculate the total cost based on the number of petunias and sweet potato vines needed for each basket, and then multiply by the number of baskets.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of petunias and sweet potato vines for one basket:**\n   - Each basket has 30 petunias.\n   - Each basket has 20 sweet potato vines.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of petunias and sweet potato vines for 50 baskets:**\n   - Total petunias = 30 petunias/basket × 50 baskets\n   - Total sweet potato vines = 20 vines/basket × 50 baskets\n\n3. **Calculate the cost for the petunias and sweet potato vines:**\n   - Cost per petunia is $3.00.\n   - Cost per sweet potato vine is $2.50.\n\n4. **Compute the total costs:**\n   - Total cost of petunias = Total petunias × $3.00\n   - Total cost of sweet potato vines = Total sweet potato vines × $2.50\n\n5. **Add the two total costs to get the final result.**\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of baskets\nnum_baskets = 50\n\n# Petunias per basket and cost\npetunias_per_basket = 30\ncost_per_petunia = 3.00\n\n# Sweet potato vines per basket and cost\nvines_per_basket = 20\ncost_per_vine = 2.50\n\n# Total number of each type for all baskets\ntotal_petunias = petunias_per_basket * num_baskets\ntotal_vines = vines_per_basket * num_baskets\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost_petunias = total_petunias * cost_per_petunia\ntotal_cost_vines = total_vines * cost_per_vine\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = total_cost_petunias + total_cost_vines\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nVerifying:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of petunias: \\(30 \\times 50 = 1500\\).\n2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines: \\(20 \\times 50 = 1000\\).\n3. Calculate the cost for petunias: \\(1500 \\times 3.00 = 4500\\).\n4. Calculate the cost for vines: \\(1000 \\times 2.50 = 2500\\).\n5. Add both totals: \\(4500 + 2500 = 7000\\).\n\nThus, Katherine will spend \\(\\boxed{7000}\\) dollars filling all 50 hanging baskets."
