On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.

      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the earnings of both Billy and Sally over the same time period, then find the difference. Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n### Billy's Earnings\n1. **Starting Salary**: $10.00 per hour.\n2. **After 2 Months**: Increase by $0.50 per hour, so his rate becomes $10.50 per hour.\n3. **First Anniversary**: Further increase by $1.00 per hour, resulting in a new rate of $11.50 per hour.\n\nBilly works at the rate of $11.50 per hour.\n\n### Sally's Earnings\n1. **Starting Salary**: It is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n2. **After 2 Months**: Sally's rate increases by $0.50 per hour, resulting in $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.\n\nSally works at the rate of $11.00 per hour.\n\n### Calculate Earnings for 20 Hours\n1. **Billy's Earnings**: 20 hours \\(\\times\\) $11.50/hour = $230.00\n2. **Sally's Earnings**: 20 hours \\(\\times\\) $11.00/hour = $220.00\n\nThe difference in their earnings is $230.00 - $220.00 = $10.00.\n\n### Verification\n- **Billy's Rate**: Starting at $10.00, first increase brings it to $10.50, and the second increase makes it $11.50.\n- **Sally's Rate**: Starting at $10.50, an additional $0.50 raise results in $11.00.\n- **Hourly Earnings Calculation**: 20 hours \\(\\times\\) the respective rate.\n- **Difference**: $230.00 - $220.00, confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the amount Billy earns compared to Sally is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars."
