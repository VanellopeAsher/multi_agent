Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?"

      "content": "Key Idea: To solve this, we'll calculate the total steps Elliott has already taken and determine how many steps he completed during his jog.\n\nElliott's daily goal is 10,000 steps. We know:\n- He finished half of his steps walking to and from school: \\( \\frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \\) steps.\n- He took another 1,000 steps with his friend.\n- He also took 500 steps shopping.\n\nAfter his jog, he has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.\n\nLet's calculate the number of steps he took during his jog step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total steps taken before the jog.\n2. Subtract these steps from the daily goal, accounting for the remaining steps.\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy to handle the mathematical computation elegantly\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the total steps goal\ntotal_steps_goal = 10000\n\n# Steps Elliott already took\nsteps_school = 5000\nsteps_friend = 1000\nsteps_shopping = 500\n\n# Steps remaining after the jog\nsteps_remaining = 2000\n\n# Calculate the total steps taken before the jog\nsteps_taken_before_jog = steps_school + steps_friend + steps_shopping\n\n# Let steps_jog be the number of steps he took during the jog\nsteps_jog = symbols('steps_jog')\n\n# The equation representing the total steps taken\nequation = Eq(steps_taken_before_jog + steps_jog + steps_remaining, total_steps_goal)\n\n# Solving for steps_jog\nsteps_jog_value = solve(equation, steps_jog)[0]\n\n# Display the result\nprint(f\"Elliott took {steps_jog_value} steps during his jog.\")\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Calculated total steps before jogging: 5,000 from school + 1,000 with friend + 500 shopping = 6,500 steps.\n2. Total needed to reach 10,000: \n   \\( 10,000 - 6,500 - 2,000 = 1,500 \\) steps during the jog.\n\nI've verified the calculation, and our solution is consistent.\n\nThus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \\(\\boxed{1500}\\)."
