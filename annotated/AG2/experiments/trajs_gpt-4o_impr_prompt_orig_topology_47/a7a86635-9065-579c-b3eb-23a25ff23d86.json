Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the distribution of the seashells collected by the boys and the girls during the school trip.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n1. The total number of kids is given as 200.\n2. They were divided into two equal groups: one group of boys and another group of girls. Therefore, there must be 100 boys and 100 girls.\n\n**Problem Breakdown:**\n1. Each boy collected 600 seashells. Since there are 100 boys, the total number of seashells collected by boys is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total seashells by boys} = 100 \\times 600 = 60000\n   \\]\n\n2. The girls collected seashells such that the total number of seashells brought back by the girls equals the total number collected by the boys plus four times the number of seashells collected by the boys:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seashells by girls} = \\text{Seashells by boys} + 4 \\times \\text{Seashells by boys}\n   \\]\n\n3. Therefore, the girls collected:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total seashells by girls} = 60000 + 4 \\times 60000 = 300000\n   \\]\n\n4. Since there are 100 girls, to find out how many seashells each girl collected, we divide the total number of seashells collected by the girls by the number of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seashells per girl} = \\frac{300000}{100} = 3000\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify our calculations using Python code:\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of boys\nboys_count = 100\n# Seashells collected per boy\nseashells_per_boy = 600\n# Total seashells collected by boys\ntotal_seashells_boys = boys_count * seashells_per_boy\n\n# Total seashells collected by girls: boys' seashells + 4 times boys' seashells\ntotal_seashells_girls = total_seashells_boys + 4 * total_seashells_boys\n\n# Number of girls\ngirls_count = 100\n# Seashells per girl\nseashells_per_girl = Rational(total_seashells_girls, girls_count)\n\n# Print the result using Rational to keep it in fraction if needed\nprint(seashells_per_girl)\n```\n\nThis code will output the number of seashells collected by each girl.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. Number of boys = 100 and each boy collected 600 seashells. Thus, seashells by boys = 60000.\n2. Girls collected 60000 + 4 * 60000 = 300000 seashells.\n3. Number of girls = 100.\n4. Each girl collected 3000 seashells.\n\nThe calculations and logic are consistent, leading us to the final boxed answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3000}\n\\]"
