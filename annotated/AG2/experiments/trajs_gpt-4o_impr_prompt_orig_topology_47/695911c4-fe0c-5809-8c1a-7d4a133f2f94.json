Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Pauline's museum visits over the years. Let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Determine the initial cost of one visit.\n2. Calculate the increased cost of a visit after 10 years.\n3. Calculate the total cost over the entire duration, which includes the first 10 years and the additional 3 years.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Initial Visit Cost:**\n   - Pauline's initial cost per visit is $10.\n\n2. **Increased Visit Cost After 10 Years:**\n   - The cost increases by 150%.\n   - New cost per visit after 10 years:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{New Cost} = \\text{Original Cost} + (\\text{Original Cost} \\times 1.5)\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the original cost of $10 to find the new cost.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - Compute the total cost for the first 10 years.\n     - Number of visits in 10 years: \\(3 \\text{ times per year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 30 \\text{ visits}\\).\n     - Cost for the first 10 years: \\( 30 \\text{ visits} \\times \\$10 \\).\n\n   - Compute the total cost for the next 3 years.\n     - Number of visits in next 3 years: \\(3 \\text{ times per year} \\times 3 \\text{ years} = 9 \\text{ visits}\\).\n     - Cost for these 9 visits at the new rate.\n\n4. **Sum the costs for all visits.**\n\nLet's implement this solution in Python using these steps:\n\n```python\n# Importing the required library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial cost per visit\ninitial_cost = 10\n\n# Increase in cost (150%)\nincrease_percentage = 150 / 100\n\n# New cost per visit\nnew_cost = initial_cost + (initial_cost * increase_percentage)\n\n# Total cost for the first 10 years\nvisits_first_10_years = 3 * 10\ncost_first_10_years = visits_first_10_years * initial_cost\n\n# Total cost for the next 3 years\nvisits_next_3_years = 3 * 3\ncost_next_3_years = visits_next_3_years * new_cost\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_first_10_years + cost_next_3_years\n\n# Printing the total cost\nprint(\"The total cost Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $\", total_cost)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**\n   - Verify that the original cost is used correctly: \\(10 \\text{ dollars per visit}\\).\n\n2. **Increase in Cost Check:**\n   - Verify the computation of increased cost:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{New Cost} = 10 + (10 \\times 1.5) = 25\n     \\]\n\n3. **First 10 Years Verification:**\n   - Cost for 30 visits in the first 10 years: \\(30 \\times 10 = 300\\).\n\n4. **Next 3 Years Verification:**\n   - Cost for 9 visits in the next 3 years at the new rate: \\(9 \\times 25 = 225\\).\n\n5. **Final Total Calculation:**\n   - Total cost: \\(300 + 225 = 525\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{525}\n\\]\n\nPauline spent a total of $525 on all her museum visits over the 13 years."

This matches our breakdown:\n\n- For the first 10 years, visiting 3 times a year at $10 per visit resulted in a total of $300.\n- In the subsequent 3 years, visits cost $25 each (after a 150% increase), leading to $225 for those 9 visits.\n\nThus, the total cost over 13 years is indeed \\( \\boxed{525} \\)."
