Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Scarlett spent by summing up the costs of each item she purchased. Let's break down the purchases and calculate the total cost step-by-step.\n\n1. **Aquarium Cost**: $10.00\n2. **Cost of Rocks**: Scarlett bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each.\n   - Total cost for rocks = \\(2 \\times 2.50\\)\n3. **Cost of Coral**: Scarlett bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each.\n   - Total cost for coral = \\(3 \\times 2.00\\)\n4. **Fish Cost**: She bought 20 fish. The cost per fish is not specified in the problem. Thus, we assume each fish was obtained at no additional cost for this calculation.\n5. **Fish Food Cost**: $2.00\n\nNow, let's use Python to calculate the total cost:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs of individual items\naquarium_cost = Rational(10, 1)\nrock_cost = 2 * Rational(2.50)\ncoral_cost = 3 * Rational(2.00)\nfish_food_cost = Rational(2, 1)\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = aquarium_cost + rock_cost + coral_cost + fish_food_cost\n\n# Display the result\nprint(\"Total amount spent:\", total_cost)\n```\n\nNext, let's run this code to find out the total cost Scarlett spent.\n\n```python\n# your code from above\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Aquarium**: $10.00\n2. **Rocks**: 2 bags at $2.50 each = $5.00\n3. **Coral**: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = $6.00\n4. **Fish Food**: $2.00\n\nAdd each cost:\n- Aquarium: $10.00\n- Rocks: $5.00\n- Coral: $6.00\n- Fish Food: $2.00\n\nSum: \n\\[ 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = 23.00 \\]\n\nThe calculation is verified to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Scarlett spent is \\(\\boxed{23}\\)."
