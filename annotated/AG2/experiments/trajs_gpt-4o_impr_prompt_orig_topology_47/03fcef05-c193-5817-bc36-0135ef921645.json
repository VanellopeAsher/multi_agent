      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRaymond initially had $2100. Then he saved $1100 from his allowance and spent $500 on a comic book and $1900 on a puzzle. How much money does Raymond have left?"

      "content": "**Problem-Solving Approach:**\n\nLet's model this problem using a simple arithmetic calculation and ensure our approach aligns with the rules provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Initial Amount:** Raymond initially had \\$2100.\n2. **Savings Added:** He saved an additional \\$1100.\n3. **Expenses:** \n   - He spent \\$500 on a comic book.\n   - He spent \\$1900 on a puzzle.\n\nTo find out how much money Raymond has left, we can follow these calculations:\n\n- **Calculate the total money Raymond has after savings:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total after savings} = \\text{Initial Amount} + \\text{Saved Amount} = 2100 + 1100\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculate the total spending:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Spending} = 500 + 1900\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculate the remaining money:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Remaining Money} = \\text{Total after savings} - \\text{Total Spending}\n  \\]\n\n### Python Code for Calculation:\n\n```python\n# Calculation using variables\ninitial_amount = 2100\nsaved_amount = 1100\nexpense_comic = 500\nexpense_puzzle = 1900\n\n# Calculate total after savings\ntotal_after_savings = initial_amount + saved_amount\n\n# Calculate total spending\ntotal_spending = expense_comic + expense_puzzle\n\n# Calculate remaining money\nremaining_money = total_after_savings - total_spending\n\n# Print the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\n### Executing the Code:\n\nTo find the result of the above calculations, we run the code to get the remaining amount. Let's execute the plan.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Verify Total Money After Savings:**\n   \\[\n   2100 + 1100 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verify Total Spending:**\n   \\[\n   500 + 1900 = 2400\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify Remaining Money Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   3200 - 2400 = 800\n   \\]\n\nAfter ensuring each calculation step is accurate, we conclude that the remaining money Raymond has is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{800}\n\\]"
