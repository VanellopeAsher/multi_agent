Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  The alcohol content of cognac is 15% stronger than scotch.  How much does he spend on everything?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a step-by-step process.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Cost of One Bottle of Scotch:**\n   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600.\n   - The cost per bottle of scotch is $600 ÷ 10 = $60.\n\n2. **Determine the Characteristics and Cost of Cognac:**\n   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.\n   - Therefore, he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of one bottle of scotch.\n   - Hence, the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + 0.5 × $60 = $90.\n\n3. **Compute the Total Cost of Cognac:**\n   - The total cost for 20 bottles of cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Expenditure:**\n   - Total expenditure includes the cost of both scotch and cognac.\n   - Total amount spent = $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process Using Python and sympy:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Cost of one bottle of scotch\ncost_scotch_per_bottle = Rational(600, 10)\n\n# Number of cognac bottles\nnumber_of_cognac_bottles = 2 * 10\n\n# Cost of one bottle of cognac (50% more than scotch)\ncost_cognac_per_bottle = cost_scotch_per_bottle * Rational(3, 2)\n\n# Total cost for cognac\ntotal_cost_cognac = number_of_cognac_bottles * cost_cognac_per_bottle\n\n# Total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = 600 + total_cost_cognac\n\n# Output total expenditure\nprint(total_expenditure)\n```\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Check the cost per bottle calculations:**\n   - Scotch: $60 per bottle as calculated by $600/10.\n   - Cognac: $60 + 50% of $60 = $90 per bottle.\n\n2. **Check the number of bottles purchased:**\n   - 10 bottles of scotch, 20 bottles of cognac (double the scotch).\n\n3. **Check the multiplication for total costs:**\n   - Cognac total: 20 × $90 = $1800.\n   - Total expenditure: $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.\n\nAfter verifying these steps, we can confidently state the total expenditure.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]"
