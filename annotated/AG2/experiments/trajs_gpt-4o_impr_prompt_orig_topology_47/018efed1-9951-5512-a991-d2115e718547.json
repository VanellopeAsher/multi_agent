      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day. He worked for an entire week and saved a total of $110. How much did he spend?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll determine Gerald's total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he saved to find out his expenses.\n\nWe'll use a direct Python solution to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary libraries\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Variables\ndaily_earnings = 30  # Gerald earns $30 per day\ndays_worked = 7  # Gerald worked for 7 days\ntotal_savings = 110  # Total amount saved\n\n# Total earnings in a week\ntotal_earnings = daily_earnings * days_worked\n\n# Equation to determine spending\nspending = symbols('spending')\nequation = Eq(total_earnings - spending, total_savings)\n\n# Solve for spending\nsolution = solve(equation, spending)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\n### Key Idea:\nGerald earns $30 per day and works for an entire week, totaling 7 days. His total earnings are $30 multiplied by 7. Since he saved $110 out of his total earnings, the difference between his total earnings and his savings is the amount he spent.\n\n### Verification:\n1. Calculate Gerald's total earnings:\n   - \\(30 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 210 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n\n2. Calculate his spending:\n   - \\(210 \\text{ dollars (total earnings)} - 110 \\text{ dollars (savings)} = 100 \\text{ dollars (spending)}\\)\n\nThe calculations confirm that Gerald spent $100.\n\n### Final Result:\n\\(\\boxed{100}\\)"
