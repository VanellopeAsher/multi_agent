Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's determine the total amount Suzie spent on all the packs of gum. We can break down the problem using the given information:\n\n1. **Strawberry Gum Cost**:\n   - Suzie bought two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry.\n   - Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.\n   - Total cost for strawberry gum = \\(2 \\text{ packs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per pack} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\n2. **Grape Gum Cost**:\n   - Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.\n   - Total cost for grape gum = $2.\n\n3. **Green Apple Gum Cost**:\n   - Suzie paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum as she did for a pack of grape gum.\n   - Since the grape gum cost $2, the green apple gum cost \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ dollar}\\).\n\n4. **Total Cost**:\n   - Combine all costs to find the total amount Suzie paid.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the costs\nstrawberry_cost = 2  # cost per pack\nstrawberry_packs = 2  # number of packs\ngrape_cost = 2  # cost of grape gum\ngreen_apple_cost = grape_cost / 2  # cost of green apple gum\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = (strawberry_cost * strawberry_packs) + grape_cost + green_apple_cost\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThe next step is to verify the solution and present the final answer:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Strawberry Packs**: \n   - Purchased: 2 packs at $2 each.\n   - Total strawberry cost: $4.\n\n2. **Grape Gum**:\n   - Purchased: 1 pack at $2.\n   - Total grape cost: $2.\n\n3. **Green Apple Gum**:\n   - Cost: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\) = $1.\n   - Total green apple cost: $1.\n\n4. **Summing Everything**:\n   - Total = $4 (strawberry) + $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $7.\n\nSuzie paid a total of $7 for all the packs of gum.\n\nThe final result is **boxed{7}**."
