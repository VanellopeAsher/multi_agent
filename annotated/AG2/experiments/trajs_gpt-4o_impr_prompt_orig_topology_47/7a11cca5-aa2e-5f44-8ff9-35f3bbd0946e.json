Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases on the third day so that the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons, calculate the increase amount in the third day."

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first identify the information given and what we are asked to find.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\n- Initial amount of water passing through the river on the first day: 4000 gallons.\n- On the second day, the amount doubles due to heavy rain.\n- On the third day, the total amount of water passing through becomes 14000 gallons.\n- We need to find how much the water increased on the third day.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the amount on the second day:**\n\n   Since the amount of water doubles on the second day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount on second day} = 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the increase on the third day:**\n\n   On the third day, the total amount is given as 14000 gallons. Therefore, the increase on the third day can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase on third day} = \\text{Amount on third day} - \\text{Amount on second day} = 14000 - 8000 = 6000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nLet's verify all calculations and conclusions in the next section.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- The initial amount of water is 4000 gallons.\n- After doubling due to the rain, the second day's measurement confirms to 8000 gallons.\n- The total on the third day is 14000 gallons, implying an increase of 6000 gallons from the second day to the third.\n\nAll calculations match the given conditions. Therefore, the increase in the amount of water on the third day is correctly found to be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6000}\n\\]"
