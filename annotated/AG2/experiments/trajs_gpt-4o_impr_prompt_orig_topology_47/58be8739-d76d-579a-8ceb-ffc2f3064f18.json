Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of time John spent on all activities during his vacation. Then, we can calculate the time he spent sightseeing.\n\n### Problem Breakdown and Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Time Spent on Boating and Swimming:**\n   - Boating: 6 hours\n   - Swimming: Half of boating time = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3 \\) hours\n\n2. **Calculate Time Spent Watching Shows:**\n   - Watched 3 shows, each 2 hours: \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\n3. **Compute the Total Time Spent on Activities Above:**\n   - Total time = Boating + Swimming + Watching Shows = \\( 6 + 3 + 6 \\) hours\n\n4. **Determine the Total Time John Spent on These Activities:**\n   - This accounts for 30% of his total time on vacation.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Time on Vacation:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the total time spent on vacation.\n   - Given: 30% of the total time \\( x \\) is equal to the time spent on these activities: \\( (30/100) \\times x = 15 \\)\n\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - By rearranging the equation: \\( x = \\frac{15}{0.3} \\)\n\n7. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - Once we determine the total time \\( x \\), the time spent sightseeing is \\( x - 15 \\).\n\nLet's execute the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Declare the total time variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for total time\nequation = (0.3 * x) - 15\n\n# Solve for x\ntotal_time = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Time spent sightseeing\ntime_sightseeing = total_time - 15\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Total time spent sightseeing: {time_sightseeing} hours\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Check Calculation of Total Time:**\n   - 30% of \\( x = 15 \\) hours implies \\( x = 50 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - Total time \\( x = 50 \\) hours\n   - Time spent on activities (Boating, Swimming, Shows) = 15 hours\n   - Time Sightseeing = \\( 50 - 15 = 35 \\) hours\n\nAfter solving, rechecking, and verifying our steps, we have determined the time John spent sightseeing:\n\n\\(\\boxed{35}\\)"
