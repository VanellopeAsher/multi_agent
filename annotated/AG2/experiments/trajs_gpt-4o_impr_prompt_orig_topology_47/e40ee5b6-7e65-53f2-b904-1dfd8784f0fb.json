Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon. Given that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5, can you determine the total sum of money she expended on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon?"

      "content": "Let's solve the problem using a direct Python solution. We'll leverage sympy to maintain fractional computations, though this problem is straightforward and does not necessarily require it. Here's how we'll solve it:\n\n1. First, determine the price of a half-gallon jar.\n2. Calculate the total cost for buying 10 one-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.\n3. Output the result.\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Given data\nprice_one_gallon = 5\nprice_difference = 2\n\n# Setting up the equation to find the price of a half-gallon jar\nprice_half_gallon = symbols('price_half_gallon')\nequation = Eq(price_one_gallon, price_half_gallon + price_difference)\n\n# Solve the equation\nprice_half_gallon_value = solve(equation, price_half_gallon)[0]\n\n# Calculating the total cost\ntotal_cost = (10 * price_one_gallon) + (16 * price_half_gallon_value)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"The total sum of money spent is:\", total_cost)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define the price of a half-gallon jar symbolically and set up an equation based on the problem's information: the price of a one-gallon jar is $2 more than the half-gallon jar.\n- We solve the equation for the half-gallon jar's price.\n- We compute the total spent on 10 one-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.\n- Finally, we print out the calculated total sum.\n\nLet's calculate and check our solution to ensure it's correct.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the half-gallon jar price**: \\\n   Since a one-gallon jar is $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, the half-gallon jar costs:\n   \\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \\]\n\n2. **Compute the total cost**:\n   - Cost of 10 one-gallon jars: \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\)\n   - Cost of 16 half-gallon jars: \\( 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\)\n   - Total cost: \\( 50 + 48 = 98 \\)\n\nThe total sum of money Cecelia expended is \\(\\boxed{98}\\)."
