Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward arithmetic approach. Here's how we can tackle it:\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nThe problem describes three groups of students playing different sports:\n1. Tennis: 6 students\n2. Volleyball: Twice the number of students playing tennis\n3. Soccer: Some boys and 22 girls\n\nWe need to find the total number of students participating in these sports.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Calculate the number of students playing volleyball based on the given information.\n2. Sum the number of students in all the groups.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Tennis:** There are 6 students.\n2. **Volleyball:** There are twice as many students as playing tennis, so this is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) students.\n3. **Soccer:** We have some boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is \\(x + 22\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of boys.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the total number of students. Notice that the exact number of boys is not necessary unless we need a specific breakdown. To find the total without the exact number of boys, letâ€™s sum the known values:\n\n**Total Students:**\n\\[ \n6 \\text{ (tennis) } + 12 \\text{ (volleyball) } + (x + 22) \\text{ (soccer) } \n= 18 + x + 22 \n= x + 40 \n\\]\n\nGiven we don't have the exact number of boys, we cannot find a specific number unless given. Thus, the answer relies on knowing \\(x\\).\n\nSince we can't proceed further without additional information about the number of boys, this stands as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{None}\n\\] \n\nWe are not able to determine the precise total number of students due to the missing information regarding the number of boys playing soccer."
