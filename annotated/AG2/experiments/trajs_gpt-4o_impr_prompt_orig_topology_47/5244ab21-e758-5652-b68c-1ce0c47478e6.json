      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges. She gifted her mother and her sibling two boxes each. She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself and sold the rest. If each box has 20 oranges, can you determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach to ensure clarity. This problem can be solved directly using reasoning and basic arithmetic calculations:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Initial Total Number of Boxes:**\n   - Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges.\n   - A dozen is equal to 12, so initially, she has 12 boxes.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Boxes After Gifting:**\n   - She gives away 2 boxes to her mother and 2 boxes to her sibling.\n   - Total boxes gifted = 2 + 2 = 4.\n   - Remaining boxes = 12 (initial) - 4 (gifted) = 8 boxes.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Oranges per Box:**\n   - Each box contains 20 oranges.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Oranges Left:**\n   - Oranges in the remaining boxes = 8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges.\n\n5. **Determine the Number of Oranges Mrs. Harrington Kept:**\n   - She kept a quarter of these oranges for herself.\n   - A quarter of the remaining oranges = 160 / 4 = 40 oranges.\n\n6. **Calculate the Number of Oranges Sold:**\n   - Oranges sold = Total remaining oranges - Oranges kept = 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.\n\n### Verification:\n- Initial boxes: 12\n- Oranges per box: 20\n- Total oranges initially = 12 * 20 = 240\n- Oranges in boxes after gifting 4 boxes = (12 - 4) * 20 = 8 * 20 = 160\n- Oranges kept after gifting = 160 / 4 = 40\n- Oranges sold = 160 - 40 = 120\n\nAll calculations match correctly.\n\nThe number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
