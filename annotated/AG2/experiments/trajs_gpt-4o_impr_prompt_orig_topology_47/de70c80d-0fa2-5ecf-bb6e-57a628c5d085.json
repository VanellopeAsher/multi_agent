Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full three times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow a clear, step-by-step reasoning approach. Let's break down the steps Elise takes to write the alphabet:\n\n1. **Write the Alphabet in Full Three Times:** \n   - The alphabet has 26 letters.\n   - Writing it in full three times means Elise writes \\(26 \\times 3\\) letters.\n\n2. **Write Half of the Alphabet Once:** \n   - Half of the alphabet is \\( \\lfloor \\frac{26}{2} \\rfloor = 13 \\) letters.\n   - So, she writes 13 more letters.\n\n3. **Rewrite Everything She Has Already Written:**\n   - After completing the steps above, we calculate how many letters Elise has written so far.\n   - Then, she rewrites all of these letters once more.\n\nLet's compute this step by step using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the initial total of letters written\ninitial_full_writes = 26 * 3\nhalf_write = 13\ninitial_total = initial_full_writes + half_write\n\n# Rewrite the initial total\nfinal_total = initial_total * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(final_total)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify our steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Elise writes the full alphabet 3 times: \n  - \\( 3 \\times 26 = 78 \\).\n\n- **Step 2:** She writes half the alphabet: \n  - \\( 78 + 13 = 91 \\).\n\n- **Step 3:** She rewrites all the letters already written:\n  - \\( 91 \\times 2 = 182 \\).\n\nSumming it up, how many letters are written makes sense according to each step. Therefore, the total number of letters Elise writes is\n\n\\[\\boxed{182}\\]"
