Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends. How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many Valentine's Day cards Erica currently has, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Cards Created by Erica:**  \n   Erica made 20 Valentine's cards herself.\n\n2. **Cards Received from Dad:**  \n   Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. However, the problem does not specify how many cards were in each box. This information is missing and crucial for our calculation.\n\n3. **Total Cards Passed Out by Erica:**  \n   - She gave out 24 cards to her classmates.\n   - She gave 5 cards to her family.\n   Hence, Erica passed out a total of \\(24 + 5 = 29\\) cards.\n\n4. **Cards Received by Erica:**  \n   She received 17 cards from family and friends.\n\nDue to the missing information regarding how many cards were in the boxes from her dad, we're unable to calculate the exact current number of cards Erica has. To represent this, we will return the solution as being unsolvable with the provided data.\n\nThe missing information is crucial:\n- The number of cards per box from her dad must be known to proceed.\n\nGiven these details, we find that the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\] \n\nVERIFICATION:\n- We've confirmed each given detail and verified the necessity of the missing data regarding the box contents. Without it, the problem cannot be resolved definitively."
