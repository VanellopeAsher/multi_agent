Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and a half as much the other two days he runs. He rests for 2 hours after each run. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out John's running speed, given his weekly running schedule. We'll approach this step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Determine Total Weekly Running Time**\n\n1. John runs 3 hours on the first day.\n2. For the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day:\n   - \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours each day.\n3. Total weekly running time \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   T = 3 \\, \\text{hours} + 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} + 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 6 \\, \\text{hours}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Running Speed**\n\n- John runs a total of 60 miles per week.\n- He runs for 6 hours each week.\n\nRunning speed \\( S \\) is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, let’s put this into Python for verification:\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy for symbolic calculations (if needed, but not necessary here as it's simple arithmetic)\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Variables\ntotal_miles = 60\nhours_first_day = 3\nhours_other_days = [Rational(3, 2), Rational(3, 2)]  # Half as much for the other days\n\n# Total hours per week\ntotal_hours = hours_first_day + sum(hours_other_days)\n\n# Calculate speed (miles per hour)\nspeed = Rational(total_miles, total_hours)\n\n# Print the result using a fraction\nprint(\"John's running speed is:\", speed, \"miles per hour\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION SECTION**\n\n1. **Calculation of Total Time**: \n   - First day: 3 hours\n   - Two other days: 1.5 hours each, total \\( 1.5 \\times 2 = 3 \\) hours\n   - Total: \\( 3 + 3 = 6 \\) hours. Correct!\n\n2. **Speed Calculation**:\n   - Total distance: 60 miles\n   - Total time: 6 hours\n   - Speed: \\( \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\) miles per hour. Correct!\n\nWe verified that each step logically adds up to our final conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the speed at which John runs is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) miles per hour."
