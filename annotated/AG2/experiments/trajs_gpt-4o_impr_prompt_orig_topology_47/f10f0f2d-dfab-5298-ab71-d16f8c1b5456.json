Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day. He worked for an entire week, during which he also babysat his neighbor's kids for 2 hours each day at a rate of $0. However, he spent a total of $100 on groceries and other necessities. How much money does he have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow the problem-solving approach outlined:\n\n**Key Idea:** We need to calculate Gerald's net earnings for the week after deducting his expenses. This involves simple arithmetic operations, so we can use a direct Python solution.\n\n**Information Provided:**\n- Gerald earns $30 per day at the daycare.\n- He works every day for a week (7 days).\n- He also babysits his neighbor's kids but earns $0 per hour.\n- He spends $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n\n**Steps to Solution:**\n1. Calculate Gerald's total earnings from the daycare for the week.\n2. Subtract the $100 in expenses from his total earnings.\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculating total earnings\ndaily_earnings = 30\ndays_worked = 7\ntotal_earnings = daily_earnings * days_worked\n\n# Expenses\nexpenses = 100\n\n# Net earnings\nnet_earnings = total_earnings - expenses\n\n# Display the result\nprint(net_earnings)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Daily Earnings Calculation:**\n   - \\($30 \\times 7\\) days = $210 total earnings from the daycare.\n\n2. **Expense Calculation:**\n   - Gerald spends $100 on groceries and necessities.\n\n3. **Net Earnings Calculation:**\n   - $210 total earnings - $100 expenses = $110 remaining.\n\nThe calculation checks out, and I'm confident in the solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, representing Gerald's remaining money after expenses, is \\(\\boxed{110}\\)."
