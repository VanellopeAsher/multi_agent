Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow Case 1: Direct Python Solution, as the task involves performing straightforward mathematical calculations.\n\n**Step-by-step Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Monthly Debt Payments:**\n   - Student Loans: Minimum $300/month.\n   - Credit Card: Minimum $200/month.\n   - Mortgage: Minimum $500/month.\n   - Total Minimum Monthly Debt Payment = $300 + $200 + $500.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid on Debts with the 50% Increase:**\n   - If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts, we multiply the total minimum monthly debt payment by 1.5.\n\n3. **Calculate the Annual Debt Payment:**\n   - Multiply the new increased monthly debt payment by 12 to get the yearly total.\n\nNow, let's implement this using Python to find the amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum total monthly debt payment\nstudent_loans = 300\ncredit_card = 200\nmortgage = 500\n\ntotal_min_monthly_payment = student_loans + credit_card + mortgage\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the increased payment with 50% more\nincreased_payment = total_min_monthly_payment * 1.5\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the annual debt payment\nannual_debt_payment = increased_payment * 12\n\n# Print the annual debt payment\nprint(annual_debt_payment)\n```\n\nLet's break it down and verify:\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:\n   \\[\n   300 + 200 + 500 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. Apply the 50% increase:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\times 1.5 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the annual debt payment:\n   \\[\n   1500 \\times 12 = 18000\n   \\]\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, the total amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year, given she pays 50% more, is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{18000}\\)"

Since we're working with exact calculations and the requirement was to avoid decimal numbers, let's ensure the output is in an integer form.\n\nThe problem involved calculating the annual debt payment without using decimals, so the correct interpretation of the calculation should ensure output formatting accordingly.\n\nLet's correct the output format:\n\n```python\n# Re-calculate the values to ensure correct integer output.\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum total monthly debt payment\nstudent_loans = 300\ncredit_card = 200\nmortgage = 500\n\ntotal_min_monthly_payment = student_loans + credit_card + mortgage\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the increased payment with 50% more using fractions\nincrease_factor = Rational(3, 2)  # This is the fractional representation of 1.5\nincreased_payment = total_min_monthly_payment * increase_factor\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the annual debt payment\nannual_debt_payment = increased_payment * 12\n\n# Print the annual debt payment using fraction\nprint(annual_debt_payment)\n```\n\nThe use of `Rational` ensures exact arithmetic without floating-point inaccuracies. Thus, the answer in the correct output form is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{18000}\\)"
