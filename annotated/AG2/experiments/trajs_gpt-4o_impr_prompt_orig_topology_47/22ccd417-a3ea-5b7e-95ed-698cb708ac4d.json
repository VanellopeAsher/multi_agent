Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses. How many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi each time?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many milliliters (mL) of one type of medicine Saanvi uses for a single dose.\n\nKey Concept:\n\nEach dose consists of a certain amount 'x' of the first medicine and '3x' of the second medicine. For 8 doses, the total volume of medicine is given as 448 mL.\n\nLet's break this down mathematically:\n\n1. For each dose, the total volume of medicine is \\( x + 3x = 4x \\).\n2. For 8 doses, the total volume is \\( 8 \\times 4x = 32x \\).\n\nWe have the equation:\n\\[ 32x = 448 \\]\n\nWe need to solve for \\( x \\) to find out how much of the first medicine is used in each dose. Let's use Python to solve this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(32 * x, 448)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nLet's proceed with this to solve for \\( x \\)."

Each dose consists of \\( x = 14 \\) mL of one medicine, and \\( 3x = 42 \\) mL of the second medicine.\n2. Thus, each dose is: \\( 14 + 42 = 56 \\) mL.\n3. For 8 doses, the total amount of medicine is: \\( 8 \\times 56 = 448 \\) mL.\n\nSince our calculation for the total amount matches the information given in the problem, our result is verified.\n\nThe amount of one medicine combined by Saanvi in each dose is therefore \\(\\boxed{14}\\) mL."
