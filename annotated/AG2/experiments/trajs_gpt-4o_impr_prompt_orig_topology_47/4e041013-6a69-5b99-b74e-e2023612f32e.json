      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden. He can accommodate 6 red tulips per row and 8 blue tulips per row. If Jackson purchases 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of tulips will he end up planting?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a direct Python solution. We can calculate the number of rows Jackson will plant for both red and blue tulips based on their respective arrangements per row.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Calculate Rows for Red Tulips:**\n   - Jackson has 36 red tulips.\n   - He can plant 6 red tulips per row.\n   - The number of red tulip rows is given by \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Rows for Blue Tulips:**\n   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips.\n   - He can plant 8 blue tulips per row.\n   - The number of blue tulip rows is given by \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\).\n\nNow, let's implement this calculation in code:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of tulips\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\n\n# Tulips per row\nred_per_row = 6\nblue_per_row = 8\n\n# Calculate rows\nred_rows = red_tulips / red_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips / blue_per_row\n\n# Use print for output\nprint(f\"Rows of red tulips: {Rational(red_tulips, red_per_row)}\")\nprint(f\"Rows of blue tulips: {Rational(blue_tulips, blue_per_row)}\")\n\n# Output both number of rows\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- **Red Tulips Calculation**: \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) rows makes sense since 36 divided by 6 is exactly 6.\n- **Blue Tulips Calculation**: \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\) rows is accurate since 24 divided by 8 is indeed 3.\n\nBoth calculations are correctly performed without any remainder, confirming that each tulip is fully accommodated in the rows described.\n\nTherefore, Jackson will end up planting:\n\n- **6 rows for red tulips**\n- **3 rows for blue tulips**\n\nThus, the solution is verified to be correct as per the problem requirements."
