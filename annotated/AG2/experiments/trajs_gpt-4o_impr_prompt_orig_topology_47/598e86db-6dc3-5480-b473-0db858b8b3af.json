Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help some people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. He helps 240 people in total.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of days Billy is available, and then calculate how many people he helps each hour.\n\n### Step-by-step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Days:**\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 19th means 19 days in April.\n   - Total days from March 1st to April 19th = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.\n\n2. **Calculate the Days Billy Takes Off:**\n   - Billy takes off 20% of the 50 days.\n   - Days off = 20% of 50 = \\( 0.2 \\times 50 = 10 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Days Billy Works:**\n   - Total working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Hours Worked:**\n   - Billy works 3 hours each day.\n   - Total hours worked = 40 days \\(\\times\\) 3 hours/day = 120 hours.\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of People He Helps per Hour:**\n   - He helps 240 people in total.\n   - People helped per hour = Total people helped / Total hours worked = \\( \\frac{240}{120} \\).\n\nNow, let's implement this calculation in Python using the steps outlined:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of people Billy helps per hour\n\n# Total days from March 1 to April 19\ntotal_days = 31 + 19\n\n# Days Billy takes off\ndays_off = total_days * 0.2\n\n# Days Billy works\nworking_days = total_days - days_off\n\n# Total hours worked\nhours_per_day = 3\ntotal_hours = working_days * hours_per_day\n\n# Total people helped\ntotal_people = 240\n\n# People helped per hour\npeople_per_hour = total_people / total_hours\n\n# Print the result as a fraction\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(people_per_hour))\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Total days: \\(31 + 19 = 50\\)\n- Days off: \\(0.2 \\times 50 = 10\\)\n- Working days: \\(50 - 10 = 40\\)\n- Total hours worked: \\(40 \\times 3 = 120\\)\n- People helped per hour: \\(\\frac{240}{120} = 2\\)\n\nThe calculation has been verified, and the final result is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{2}\\)"
