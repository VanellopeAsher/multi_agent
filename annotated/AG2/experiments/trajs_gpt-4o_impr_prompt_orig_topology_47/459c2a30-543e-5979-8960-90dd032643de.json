      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll start by calculating the total number of each colored square described, given the 68 square feet total. Then, we'll determine the count of white squares based on the remaining area.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Determine the number of each colored square:**\n    - Red squares: \\(14\\)\n    - Blue squares: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.\n      \\[\n      \\text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18\n      \\]\n    - Green squares: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.\n      \\[\n      \\text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24\n      \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total of red, blue, and green squares:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total colored squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 = 56\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the area occupied by the white squares:**\n   - Since Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet, the number of white squares is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{White squares} = 68 - 56 = 12\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find out how much fewer white squares are than green squares:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Green squares} - \\text{White squares} = 24 - 12 = 12\n   \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- Calculating each step one more time:\n  - Red squares: 14\n  - Blue squares: \\(14 + 4 = 18\\)\n  - Green squares: \\(18 + 6 = 24\\)\n  - Total non-white squares: \\(14 + 18 + 24 = 56\\)\n  - White squares: \\(68 - 56 = 12\\)\n  - White squares are \\(24 - 12 = 12\\) fewer than green squares.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, all calculations align correctly, and the logic of the problem solution holds.\n\nThus, the final answer for how much fewer the white squares are than the green squares is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
