Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3.

      "content": "To determine the amount of crepe-paper streamers James needs to purchase for hanging on his backyard fence, we must first understand that the streamers will be hung along the perimeter of the fence. The tree in the middle is irrelevant for this calculation given there's no mention of attaching or draping streamers over it.\n\nHere is how we approach the problem:\n- Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence because this will give us the total length of streamers needed.\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[ P = 2(\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Length (\\( L \\)) of the fence = 20 feet\n- Width (\\( W \\)) of the fence = 15 feet\n\nLet's compute the perimeter.\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify\n\n# Define length and width\nL = 20  # Length of the fence in feet\nW = 15  # Width of the fence in feet\n\n# Calculate perimeter\nP = 2 * (L + W)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The perimeter of the fence is {P} feet.\")\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. Calculate \\( 2 \\times (20 + 15) \\).\n2. Simplifying, \\( 20 + 15 = 35 \\).\n3. Therefore, \\( 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\).\n\nThe calculated perimeter of the fence is verified to be 70 feet. Hence, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe-paper streamers.\n\nFinal result:\n\\[\n\\boxed{70}\n\\]"
