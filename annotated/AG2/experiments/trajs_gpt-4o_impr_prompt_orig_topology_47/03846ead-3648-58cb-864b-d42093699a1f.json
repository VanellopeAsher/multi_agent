Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStudents in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior.

We'll write a program that calculates the total points collected by Alex, Mary, Bella, and Tim, and then determine how many more points the class needs to reach the 500-point threshold for the field trip.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate Bella's Points**:\n   - Bella collected 30% more points than Alex.\n   - Alex has 60 points.\n   - Bella's points = 60 + (0.3 * 60)\n\n2. **Calculate Tim's Points**:\n   - Tim has 40 points less than Bella.\n   - Tim's points = Bella's points - 40\n\n3. **Calculate Mary's Points**:\n   - Mary collected 3 times more points than Tim.\n   - Mary's points = 3 * Tim's points\n\n4. **Total Points Calculation**:\n   - Sum the points of Alex, Bella, Tim, and Mary to get the total.\n\n5. **Calculate Points Missing**:\n   - Determine how many more points are needed compared to the 500-point threshold.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python using the specified format:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate Bella's points\nalex_points = 60\nbella_points = alex_points + Rational(30, 100) * alex_points\n\n# Calculate Tim's points\ntim_points = bella_points - 40\n\n# Calculate Mary's points\nmary_points = 3 * tim_points\n\n# Calculate total points collected by the class\ntotal_points = alex_points + bella_points + tim_points + mary_points\n\n# Define the threshold for the field trip\nthreshold_points = 500\n\n# Calculate points missing\npoints_missing = threshold_points - total_points\n\nprint(\"Bella's Points:\", bella_points)\nprint(\"Tim's Points:\", tim_points)\nprint(\"Mary's Points:\", mary_points)\nprint(\"Total Points Collected:\", total_points)\nprint(\"Points Missing to reach 500:\", points_missing)\n```\n\nLet's execute the solution to verify and ensure we are providing the correct outcome.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Bella's Points Calculation**:\n   - \\( 60 + 0.3 \\times 60 = 60 + 18 = 78 \\)\n\n2. **Tim's Points Calculation**:\n   - \\( 78 - 40 = 38 \\)\n\n3. **Mary's Points Calculation**:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 38 = 114 \\)\n\n4. **Total Points Calculation**:\n   - \\( 60 + 78 + 38 + 114 = 290 \\)\n\n5. **Points Missing Calculation**:\n   - \\( 500 - 290 = 210 \\)\n\nAfter performing these steps and verifying each calculation, it is clear that the class is missing 210 points to reach the field trip threshold.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
