Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow the suggested approach to calculate the total cost of Kelly's groceries and determine how much money she has left from her budget.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of one pack of bacon:**\n   - Total cost for 5 packs of bacon is $10.5.\n   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10.5 / 5.\n\n2. **Determine the cost of one packet of chicken:**\n   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\n   - So, cost per packet of chicken = 2 * (Cost per pack of bacon).\n\n3. **Cost for all 6 chicken packets:**\n   - Total cost for chicken = 6 * (Cost per packet of chicken).\n\n4. **Cost for the strawberries:**\n   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each.\n   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4.5.\n\n5. **Cost for the apples:**\n   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.\n   - Cost per pack of apples = 0.5 * $4.5.\n   - Total cost for apples = 7 * (Cost per pack of apples).\n\n6. **Calculate the total grocery bill:**\n   - Total cost = Total cost of bacon + Total cost of chicken + Total cost of strawberries + Total cost of apples.\n\n7. **Determine the remaining budget:**\n   - Kelly's budget is $65.\n   - Money left = Kelly's budget - Total cost.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code:\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Cost of 5 packs of bacon\ntotal_bacon_cost = Rational(105, 10)\nbacon_pack_cost = total_bacon_cost / 5\n\n# Cost per packet of chicken\nchicken_pack_cost = 2 * bacon_pack_cost\ntotal_chicken_cost = 6 * chicken_pack_cost\n\n# Cost for 3 packs of strawberries\nstrawberry_pack_cost = Rational(45, 10)\ntotal_strawberry_cost = 3 * strawberry_pack_cost\n\n# Cost per pack of apples (half the price of strawberries)\napple_pack_cost = strawberry_pack_cost / 2\ntotal_apple_cost = 7 * apple_pack_cost\n\n# Total grocery cost\ntotal_grocery_cost = total_bacon_cost + total_chicken_cost + total_strawberry_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# Kelly's budget\nbudget = 65\n\n# Calculate the money left in Kelly's budget\nmoney_left = budget - total_grocery_cost\n\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the exact costs using fractions to avoid any rounding issues and gives the exact amount left in Kelly's budget. Let's check the output to see how much money she has left."
