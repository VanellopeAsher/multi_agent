Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards. There is a total of 447 cards. Becca has 15 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards that PJ has. How many cards does Becca have?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use algebra to represent the relationships and solve for the number of Magic Cards each person has. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( P \\) represent the number of cards PJ has.\n   - Then, Smendrick has \\( 4P \\) cards (since Smendrick has 4 times the number PJ has).\n   - Becca has \\( 4P + 15 \\) cards (since Becca has 15 more than Smendrick).\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - We know the total number of cards is 447. So, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   P + 4P + (4P + 15) = 447\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   P + 4P + 4P + 15 = 447\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9P + 15 = 447\n   \\]\n   - Now, subtract 15 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   9P = 432\n   \\]\n   - Divide by 9:\n   \\[\n   P = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Becca's Cards:**\n   - Once we have \\( P \\), calculate the number of cards Becca has:\n   \\[\n   4P + 15 = 4 \\times 48 + 15 = 192 + 15 = 207\n   \\]\n\nNow let's verify this solution step-by-step.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- PJ has \\( 48 \\) cards.\n- Smendrick has \\( 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\) cards.\n- Becca has \\( 192 + 15 = 207 \\) cards.\n- Total: \\( 48 + 192 + 207 = 447 \\).\n\nSince each step checks out and matches the problem statement, we can confidently state the solution:\n\n\\(\\boxed{207}\\)"
