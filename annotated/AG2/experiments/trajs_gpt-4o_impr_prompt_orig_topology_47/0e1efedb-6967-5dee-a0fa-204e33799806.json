Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26. She utilized a discount voucher that reduced her total by $7. What was the total amount of money my mother expended at the gardening store?"

      "content": "To find the total amount of money expended by your mother at the gardening store, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate the initial total cost of the items (pots and garden soil).\n2. Apply the discount voucher to reduce the total cost.\n3. Find the net amount paid after applying the discount.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n- The cost of pots is $19.\n- The cost of the garden soil is $26.\n- The discount voucher is worth $7.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate the Initial Total Cost:**\n   - Add the cost of pots and the cost of garden soil.\n\n2. **Apply the Discount:**\n   - Subtract the value of the discount voucher from the initial total cost.\n\n3. **Compute the Final Amount Paid:**\n\nLet's write Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# step-by-step calculations\npots_cost = 19\nsoil_cost = 26\ndiscount = 7\n\n# Calculate the initial total cost\ninitial_total = pots_cost + soil_cost\n\n# Apply the discount\nfinal_amount = initial_total - discount\n\n# Print the result using the required output format\nprint(final_amount)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the result:\n\n1. **Calculate Initial Total:**\n   - Initial Total = $19 (pots) + $26 (soil) = $45\n\n2. **Apply Discount:**\n   - Final Amount = $45 - $7 (discount) = $38\n\nThus, your mother expended a total of $38 at the gardening store. \n\n\\[\\boxed{38}\\]"
