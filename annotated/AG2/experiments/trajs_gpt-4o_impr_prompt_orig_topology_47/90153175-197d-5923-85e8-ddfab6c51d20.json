Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume over 12 weeks if she makes a 3-egg omelet every day.\n\nWe'll use a step-by-step approach for this straightforward calculation:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs Used Per Day:** \n   - Claire uses 3 eggs each day.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Days in 12 Weeks:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week. Thus, in 12 weeks, there are:\n     \\[\n     12 \\times 7 = 84 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs Used in 12 Weeks:**\n   - Multiply the number of eggs Claire uses daily by the total number of days:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 84 = 252 \\text{ eggs}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert Total Eggs to Dozens:**\n   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen. Therefore, the number of dozens is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{252}{12} = 21 \\text{ dozens}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to confirm the result:\n\n```python\n# number of eggs used each day\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# total number of days in 12 weeks\ntotal_days = 12 * 7\n\n# total eggs used in 12 weeks\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_day * total_days\n\n# convert eggs to dozens\ndozens = total_eggs // 12\n\nprint(dozens)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify Days Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 7 = 84 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n   - This makes sense since there are indeed 7 days in a week and 12 weeks total.\n\n2. **Verify Total Eggs Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 84 = 252 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n   - The multiplication checks out.\n\n3. **Verify Dozen Conversion:**\n   \\[\n   252 \\div 12 = 21 \\text{ dozens}\n   \\]\n   - The division confirms conversion to dozens correctly.\n\nSince all our calculations have been verified, we can confidently conclude that the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{21}\\)"
