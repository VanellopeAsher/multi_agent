      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework. On Mondays and Tuesdays, he watches an hour-long episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he had to stay up late over the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spends watching TV from Monday to Friday. We'll do this by summing the time spent each day:\n\n1. **Monday and Tuesday**:  \n   - 1 hour each day.  \n   - Total: \\(1 \\, \\text{hour} + 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 2 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\n2. **Wednesday**:  \n   - Three 30-minute episodes.  \n   - Total: \\(3 \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 1.5 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\n3. **Thursday**:  \n   - 1 hour episode + 30-minute show.  \n   - Total: \\(1 \\, \\text{hour} + 0.5 \\, \\text{hour} = 1.5 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\n4. **Friday**:  \n   - Two 1-hour episodes.  \n   - Total: \\(2 \\times 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 2 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\nAdding these up gives us the total hours Frankie watched TV:\n\n\\[ 2 \\, \\text{hours (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \\, \\text{hours (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \\, \\text{hours (Thursday)} + 2 \\, \\text{hours (Friday)} \\]\n\nNow let's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Total hours watched each day\nmonday_tuesdays = 2 * 1  # 1 hour each on Monday and Tuesday\nwednesday = 3 * 0.5  # Three 30-minute episodes\nthursday = 1 + 0.5  # 1 hour and a 30-minute show\nfriday = 2 * 1  # Two 1-hour episodes\n\n# Calculate total hours\ntotal_hours = monday_tuesdays + wednesday + thursday + friday\n\n# Print the total hours\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprint(Fraction(total_hours))\n```\n\nRunning this code will output the total hours, ensuring we use the Fraction for clarity in expressing fractional hours accurately.\n\nNow, let's discuss the verification of our solution:\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n- Checked the calculation for each day, totaling:\n  - Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours\n  - Wednesday: 1.5 hours\n  - Thursday: 1.5 hours\n  - Friday: 2 hours\n- Sum these amounts: \\(2 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7\\) hours\n\nThe calculation is correct. Hence, the total time Frankie spent watching TV is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
