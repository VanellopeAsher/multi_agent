Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJake is shopping at a clothing store.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into manageable steps and make use of Python for any necessary calculations.\n\n### Key Idea\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate two main components:\n1. The total cost of buying 20 T-shirts with a \"buy one get one 50% off\" deal.\n2. The cost of buying a pair of shoes with a 40% discount.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. **Calculate the cost of the T-shirts:**\n   - For every two T-shirts Jake buys, he pays full price for one and 50% off for the second.\n   - Determine the cost for a pair of T-shirts and then calculate the total for 20 T-shirts.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**\n   - Calculate the discounted price using the given discount percentage.\n\n3. **Add the costs of T-shirts and shoes to find the total expenditure.**\n\nLet's translate this into a Python code using the `sympy` library for any necessary symbolic calculation (though we mostly deal with straightforward arithmetic here).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\ndef calculate_total_cost():\n    # Given values\n    shirt_price = 80  # Original price of each T-shirt\n    shoe_price = 400  # Original price of the shoes\n    number_of_shirts = 20\n    shirt_discount_pair_price = shirt_price + (shirt_price * Rational(1, 2))  # One full price and one half price\n    number_of_pairs = number_of_shirts // 2\n    \n    # Calculate total cost for T-shirts\n    total_shirt_cost = number_of_pairs * shirt_discount_pair_price\n    \n    # Discount on shoes\n    shoe_discounted_price = shoe_price * (Rational(60, 100))  # 60% of the original price\n    \n    # Total shopping cost\n    total_cost = total_shirt_cost + shoe_discounted_price\n    \n    print(f\"Total cost Jake spends at the store: ${total_cost}\")\n\ncalculate_total_cost()\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\nWe will go through the calculations step by step:\n1. **T-shirt cost:**\n   - Each pair of T-shirts costs \\(80 + 40 = 120\\).\n   - Cost for 10 pairs (20 shirts): \\(10 \\times 120 = 1200\\).\n\n2. **Shoes cost:**\n   - Discounted price: \\(400 \\times 0.6 = 240\\).\n\n3. **Total cost:**\n   - Total cost = \\(1200 + 240 = 1440\\).\n\nEverything checks out, so the final total amount of money Jake spends is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{1440}\\)"
