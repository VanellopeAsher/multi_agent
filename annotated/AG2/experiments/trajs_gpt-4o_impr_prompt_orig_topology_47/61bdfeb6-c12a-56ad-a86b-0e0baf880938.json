Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSamwell owns an appliance store.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of OLED TVs sold at Samwell's appliance store, given fractional sales data for other types of TVs and the total number of TVs sold. \n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. **Identify the fractional sales for each type of TV**:\n   - Smart TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the total sales\n   - Analog TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of the total sales\n   - Projection TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total sales\n   - Therefore, OLED TVs make up the rest.\n\n2. **Express the total number of TVs sold in terms of fractions**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the total number of TVs sold, which is \\( x = 40 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the fractions that represent non-OLED TVs**:\n   - Calculate the combined fraction of TVs that are not OLED TVs:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the fraction of OLED TVs**:\n   - The fraction of OLED TVs is \\( 1 - f \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the number of OLED TVs**:\n   - Multiply this fraction by the total number of TVs sold to find the number of OLED TVs.\n\nNow let's use Python and the `sympy` library to perform precise calculations for these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, simplify\n\n# Given sales fractions\nsmart_tv_fraction = Rational(1, 4)\nanalog_tv_fraction = Rational(1, 8)\nprojection_tv_fraction = Rational(1, 5)\n\n# Total fraction for non-OLED TVs\nnon_oled_fraction = smart_tv_fraction + analog_tv_fraction + projection_tv_fraction\n\n# Simplify the fraction\nnon_oled_fraction = simplify(non_oled_fraction)\n\n# Fraction for OLED TVs\noled_fraction = 1 - non_oled_fraction\n\n# Total number of TVs sold\ntotal_tv_sold = 40\n\n# Calculate number of OLED TVs\nnum_oled_tvs = oled_fraction * total_tv_sold\n\n# Print the number of OLED TVs\nprint(num_oled_tvs)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\nLet's check our calculation:\n- Sum of the fractions for non-OLED TVs:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{10}{40} + \\frac{5}{40} + \\frac{8}{40} = \\frac{23}{40}\n  \\]\n- Fraction of OLED TVs:  \n  \\[\n  1 - \\frac{23}{40} = \\frac{17}{40}\n  \\]\n\n- Number of OLED TVs:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{17}{40} \\times 40 = 17\n  \\]\n\nThus, the number of OLED TVs sold is \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."
