Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average of Wilson's five test scores to determine his current math grade. The average is the sum of the test scores divided by the number of scores.\n\nLet's proceed with Case 1: Direct Python Solution.\n\nWe'll write a Python program to calculate this average.\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary package\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given test scores\nscores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate the average score\naverage_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)\n\n# Convert the average to a fraction if necessary\naverage_score_fraction = Rational(sum(scores), len(scores))\n\n# Print the average score in fractional form\nprint(\"Average score:\", average_score_fraction)\n```\n\nLet's step through each part of this code:\n\n1. We import `Rational` from `sympy` to facilitate presenting the average as a fraction instead of a decimal.\n2. We define a list `scores` with Wilson's test scores.\n3. We calculate `average_score` by taking the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.\n4. We use `Rational` to convert the average to its simplest fractional form.\n5. Finally, we print the average score.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find out Wilson's current math grade."
