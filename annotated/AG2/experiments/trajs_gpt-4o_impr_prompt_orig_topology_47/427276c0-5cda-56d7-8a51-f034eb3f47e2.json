Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a direct mathematical approach. We'll calculate the average height of heels using the given data.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach: Case 1 - Direct Python Solution\n\n#### Key Idea:\nTo find the average height of heels, we need to calculate the total height contributed by all the heels and divide by the total number of women wearing heels.\n\n1. **Data Information:**\n   - 3 women wearing 4.5-inch heels.\n   - 3 women wearing 2.5-inch heels.\n\n2. **Steps to Solve:**\n   - Multiply the number of women by their respective heel heights to get the total height contribution for each group.\n   - Sum these total heights to get the overall total height.\n   - Divide the overall total height by the total number of women (3 + 3).\n\nHereâ€™s the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of women wearing each type of heel\nnum_women_4_5 = 3\nnum_women_2_5 = 3\n\n# Heel heights\nheel_height_4_5 = Rational(9, 2)  # 4.5 in fraction form\nheel_height_2_5 = Rational(5, 2)  # 2.5 in fraction form\n\n# Total height\ntotal_height = (num_women_4_5 * heel_height_4_5) + (num_women_2_5 * heel_height_2_5)\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = num_women_4_5 + num_women_2_5\n\n# Average height\naverage_height = total_height / total_women\n\n# Output result\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. The total height for women wearing 4.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5\\) inches.\n2. The total height for women wearing 2.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\) inches.\n3. The overall total height is \\(13.5 + 7.5 = 21\\) inches.\n4. The total number of women is \\(3 + 3 = 6\\).\n5. Therefore, the average height of the heels is \\( \\frac{21}{6} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \\) inches.\n\nAfter confirming each step, our solution is consistent and correct.\n\nThe average height of heels at the party is \\(\\boxed{3.5}\\) inches."
