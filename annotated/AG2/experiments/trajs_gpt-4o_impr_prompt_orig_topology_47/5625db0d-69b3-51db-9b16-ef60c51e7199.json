Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the total price Clara paid for 15 apples, factoring in her coupon discount, and compare it to the total price Sheila paid for 15 apples after applying the percentage discount. The final goal is to find the difference between these two totals.\n\n### Case 1: Direct Python Solution\n\nWe'll write a Python script that uses basic arithmetic operations to calculate the cost Clara and Sheila paid, and then find the difference.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Clara's purchase details\nprice_each_clara = 15  # in dollars\nnumber_of_apples = 15\nvoucher_discount = 3\n\n# Total cost for Clara\ntotal_cost_clara = price_each_clara * number_of_apples - voucher_discount\n\n# Sheila's purchase details\nprice_each_sheila = 25  # in dollars\ndiscount_percentage = 15  # 15%\n\n# Original total cost for Sheila\noriginal_cost_sheila = price_each_sheila * number_of_apples\n\n# Amount of discount Sheila gets\ndiscount_amount_sheila = original_cost_sheila * Rational(discount_percentage, 100)\n\n# Final cost for Sheila after discount\ntotal_cost_sheila = original_cost_sheila - discount_amount_sheila\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = total_cost_sheila - total_cost_clara\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is: ${difference}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Clara's Purchase**:\n   - Original cost without a discount: \\(15 \\text{ apples} \\times \\$15/\\text{apple} = \\$225\\).\n   - Subtracting Clara's voucher discount (\\$3), the total is: \\( \\$225 - \\$3 = \\$222\\).\n\n2. **Sheila's Purchase**:\n   - Original cost before discount: \\(15 \\text{ apples} \\times \\$25/\\text{apple} = \\$375\\).\n   - Applying a 15% discount: \n     - Discount amount: \\( \\$375 \\times \\frac{15}{100} = \\$56.25\\).\n     - Total after discount: \\( \\$375 - \\$56.25 = \\$318.75\\).\n\n3. **Difference**:\n   - Difference between the total amounts paid: \\( \\$318.75 - \\$222 = \\$96.75\\).\n\n### Verification\n\n1. For Clara:\n   - Check that \\( \\$15 \\times 15 = \\$225\\).\n   - Verify \\( \\$225 - \\$3 = \\$222\\).\n\n2. For Sheila:\n   - Confirm \\( \\$25 \\times 15 = \\$375\\).\n   - Calculate 15% of \\$375: \\(0.15 \\times 375 = 56.25\\).\n   - Confirm \\( \\$375 - \\$56.25 = \\$318.75\\).\n\n3. Final subtraction:\n   - Verify \\( \\$318.75 - \\$222 = \\$96.75\\).\n\nEverything checks out, thus the difference between the amounts paid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{96.75}\n\\]"
