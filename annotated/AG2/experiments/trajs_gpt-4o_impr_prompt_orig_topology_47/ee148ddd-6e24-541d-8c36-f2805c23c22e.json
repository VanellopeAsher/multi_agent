Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine his total active time, excluding breaks and lunch. Once we have that, we can calculate how much time he spent on sightseeing, knowing it was 40% of his active time.\n\nHere's how we'll tackle the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate Boating and Swimming Time:**\n    - Boating: 6 hours\n    - Swimming: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of boating time = 3 hours\n    - Total for boating and swimming = 6 + 3 = 9 hours\n\n2. **Calculate Time Spent Watching Shows:**\n    - Three shows of 2 hours each: \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\n3. **Determine the Total Active Time:**\n   - The time spent on these activities represents 30% of his total active time. Let's denote the total active time as \\( T \\).\n   - From the problem: \\( 30\\% \\times T = 9 + 6 \\)\n\n4. **Calculate Total Active Time \\( T \\):**\n   \\[\n   0.3 \\times T = 15 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T = \\frac{15}{0.3}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Sightseeing Time:**\n    - Sightseeing is 40% of \\( T \\):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Sightseeing time} = 0.4 \\times T\n    \\]\n\nNow, let's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for total active time\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Given equation based on the problem\nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, 15)\n\n# Solve for total active time\ntotal_active_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate sightseeing time (40% of total active time)\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_active_time\n\n# Display the sightseeing time in a fraction\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(sightseeing_time))\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify total time calculation:**\n   - If \\( 30\\% \\times T = 15 \\), then \\( T = \\frac{15}{0.3} = 50 \\). This confirms the equation for total active time.\n\n2. **Sightseeing time verification:**\n   - Since sightseeing is 40% of \\( T = 50 \\), it should be 20 hours (because \\( 0.4 \\times 50 = 20 \\)).\n\nThus, John spent \\(\\boxed{20}\\) hours sightseeing."
