Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \n48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. However, before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's use a structured approach, breaking it into manageable steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - Start with 48 passengers on the bus.\n\n2. **First Stop**:\n   - 8 passengers get off.\n   - Number of passengers exiting: 8.\n\n3. **After Passengers Get Off at First Stop**:\n   - `48 - 8 = 40` passengers remain on the bus.\n\n4. **Passengers Getting On at First Stop**:\n   - 5 times as many people as got off (8 people) get on: \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\) passengers get on.\n   - Total passengers after getting on: \\(40 + 40 = 80\\).\n\n5. **Passengers Deciding to Leave Before Departure at First Stop**:\n   - 2 people who just boarded decide to leave.\n   - Total passengers after these 2 people get off: \\(80 - 2 = 78\\).\n\n6. **Second Stop**:\n   - 21 passengers get off.\n   - `78 - 21 = 57` passengers remain.\n\n7. **Passengers Getting On at Second Stop**:\n   - Three times fewer passengers than got off (21 passengers) get on. \n   - This means only \\( \\frac{21}{3} = 7\\) passengers get on.\n   - Total passengers after getting on: \\(57 + 7 = 64\\).\n\nFinally, let's check our solution to ensure we've accurately captured each step and calculated the total number of passengers. If all calculations are correct and consistent with the problem statement, the answer should be correct.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n- Initial passengers: 48\n- After first stop: \\(48 - 8 + 5 \\times 8 - 2 = 78\\)\n- After second stop: \\(78 - 21 + \\frac{21}{3} = 64\\)\n\nEverything checks out according to the problem statement, so the number of passengers remaining after the second stop is 64.\n\nThe final answer presented in the required format:\n\n\\(\\boxed{64}\\)"
