Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total angular elevation of the sun above the ground after 12 hours, given its movement. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Position\nThe problem states that the pyramid's angle from the ground is 32 degrees, and the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid.\n\n### Step 2: Sun's Movement\n1. **First Phase:** For the first 10 hours, the sun moves at 5 degrees per hour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total movement in first phase} = 10 \\text{ hours} \\times 5 \\text{ degrees/hour} = 50 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Phase:** For the next 2 hours, the sun moves at 3 degrees per hour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total movement in second phase} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 3 \\text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Elevation\nInitially, the sun is at 32 degrees above the ground (aligned with the pyramid's tip). Adding the movement from both phases, we calculate the total degrees from the ground:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total elevation} = 32 \\text{ degrees (initial)} + 50 \\text{ degrees (first phase)} + 6 \\text{ degrees (second phase)}\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n1. Start at 32 degrees.\n2. Add 50 degrees for the first 10 hours.\n3. Add 6 degrees for the next 2 hours.\n4. Verify each step by adding them sequentially.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\\[ \n\\text{Total elevation} = 32 + 50 + 6 = 88 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\nThus, after 12 hours, the sun is elevated by 88 degrees from the ground. We'll output this answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Solution code\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Initial angle of elevation\ninitial_angle = 32\n\n# Movement during first 10 hours\nfirst_phase_movement = 10 * 5\n\n# Movement during next 2 hours\nsecond_phase_movement = 2 * 3\n\n# Total elevation angle calculation\ntotal_elevation = initial_angle + first_phase_movement + second_phase_movement\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(total_elevation)  # Should print 88\n```\n\nUpon verification of each calculation and method, the solution aligns with the problem's conditions. The final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]"
