She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Elvira spent in total on her computer setup, and then subtract that amount from her total budget to find out how much she has left for a new outfit.\n\nHere's how we can break it down:\n\n1. Determine the total cost of the items purchased.\n2. Subtract this total cost from the initial budget of €1500 to find the remaining amount.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the steps above:\n\n```python\n# Initial budget\nbudget = 1500\n\n# Cost of items Elvira bought\ncomputer_cost = 1090\nscanner_cost = 157\ncd_burner_cost = 74\nprinter_cost = 102\n\n# Calculate total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = computer_cost + scanner_cost + cd_burner_cost + printer_cost\n\n# Calculate the remaining money\nremaining_money = budget - total_expenditure\n\n# Output the remaining money\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation step by step:\n\n1. **Add up the expenses**:\n   - Computer cost: €1090\n   - Scanner cost: €157\n   - CD burner cost: €74\n   - Printer cost: €102\n\n   Total expenditure = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423\n\n2. **Calculate remaining budget**:\n   - Initial budget: €1500\n   - Remaining budget = €1500 - €1423 = €77\n\nThe verification steps ensure that each calculation has been checked and confirmed. The remaining budget for Elvira to purchase her new outfit is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{77} \\]"

She needs to calculate the total cost of the items she decided to purchase and then find out how much she has left for a new outfit.\n\n### Purchased Items and Their Costs\n\n1. Computer setup (including screen, keyboard, mouse): €1090\n2. Scanner: €157\n3. CD burner: €74\n4. Printer: €102\n\n### Total Expenditure Calculation\n\nThe total expenditure is the sum of all the purchased items:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total expenditure} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423\n\\]\n\n### Remaining Money Calculation\n\nThe remaining budget for her new outfit is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining budget} = 1500 - 1423 = 77\n\\]\n\n### Final Result\n\nAfter computing the above calculations, the remaining amount Elvira has left to spend on her new outfit is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{77}\n\\]\n\nThis concludes the solution to the problem based on the outlined plan.
