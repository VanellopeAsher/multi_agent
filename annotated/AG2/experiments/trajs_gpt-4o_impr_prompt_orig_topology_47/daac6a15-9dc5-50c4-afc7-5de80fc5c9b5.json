Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDerrick has a bakery that makes doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut. How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate Derrick's total earnings from selling doughnuts throughout the month of June. First, we need to know two things: \n\n1. The total number of doughnuts Derrick sells each day.\n2. The number of days in June.\n\nLet's address each part step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Number of Days in June\nJune has 30 days.\n\n### Step 2: Daily Sales Amount\nTo calculate the total revenue for June, we need to know how many doughnuts are sold each day or the total number sold in the month. However, the problem does not specify how many doughnuts are sold per day or in total over the month. \n\nIf we assume Derrick sells \\( x \\) doughnuts every day consistently, then we can express his total monthly sales as:\n\\[ \\text{Total Sales for June} = x \\times 2 \\times 30 \\]\n\nWithout the specific number of daily sales, we can't compute the exact answer.\n\n### Handling Missing Data\nDue to the absence of specific information regarding the daily or total number of doughnuts sold, the problem is unsolvable with the given data.\n\nSince we're missing the daily sales data, we will indicate this using:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n1. Confirm the number of days in June: 30 days (Correct).\n2. Understand that we require the number of doughnuts sold each day: Not provided in the problem statement.\n\nGiven this, without additional information on daily sales, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\]"
