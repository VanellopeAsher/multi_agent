      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To make things more interesting, he decided to pay her back in a unique way. For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month.

Calculate the total amount Stephen needs to pay back to his sister, including the 2% interest.\n2. Determine how much Stephen has paid over the first 11 months.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month.\n\nLet's solve this problem step by step using Python.\n\n```python\n# Import the required library for symbolic mathematics\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial borrowed amount\nborrowed_amount = 300\n\n# Interest rate\ninterest_rate = Rational(2, 100)  # 2%\n\n# Total amount to be paid back including interest\ntotal_amount_with_interest = borrowed_amount * (1 + interest_rate)\n\n# Monthly payment for the first 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\n\n# Total amount paid over the first 11 months\ntotal_paid_11_months = monthly_payment * 11\n\n# Remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month\nremaining_amount = total_amount_with_interest - total_paid_11_months\n\n# Print the result\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nNow let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Amount with Interest:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Amount} = 300 + \\left(300 \\times \\frac{2}{100}\\right) = 300 \\times 1.02 = 306\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Paid in First 11 Months:**\n   \\[\n   25 \\text{ per month} \\times 11 \\text{ months} = 275\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remaining Amount to Pay in the Twelfth Month:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining} = 306 - 275 = 31\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases, is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
