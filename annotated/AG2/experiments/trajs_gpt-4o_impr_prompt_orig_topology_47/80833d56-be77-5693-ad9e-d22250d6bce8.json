Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 100 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "**Problem-Solving Approach:**\n\nLet's model this problem mathematically.\n\nJohn runs a total of 100 miles each week, and he runs on 3 days.\n\n- On the first day, he runs for 10 hours.\n- On each of the other two days, he runs for half of the 10 hours, which means 5 hours each day.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Total Running Time:**\n   - First day: 10 hours\n   - Second day: 5 hours\n   - Third day: 5 hours\n\n   Total running time in a week = 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 hours.\n\n2. **Average Speed:**\n   - Total distance John runs in a week = 100 miles\n   - Total time spent running = 20 hours\n\n   Therefore, John's average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to maintain adherence to the style mentioned:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total miles run in a week\ntotal_miles = 100\n\n# Total hours spent running in a week\ntotal_hours = 10 + 5 + 5\n\n# Calculate average speed\naverage_speed = Rational(total_miles, total_hours)\n\n# Output the average speed\nprint(f\"John's average speed is {average_speed} miles per hour.\")\n\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Total Distance and Time:**\n   - Verified the total distance John runs per week is indeed 100 miles.\n   - Verified the running time across the three days sums up to 20 hours.\n\n2. **Calculation of Average Speed:**\n   - Calculated the average speed as \\( \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{20 \\text{ hours}} = 5 \\text{ miles per hour} \\).\n\nBy reviewing each step and the checking calculations, everything aligns correctly. \n\nThe **final verified answer** is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]\n\nJohn runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour."
