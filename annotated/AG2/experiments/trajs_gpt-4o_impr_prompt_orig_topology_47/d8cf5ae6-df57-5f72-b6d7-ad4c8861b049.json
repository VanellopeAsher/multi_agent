  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total weight of the feed and then figure out how much the farm truck must carry per trip. We can calculate the total weight by summing the individual weights of the different types of feed. Since the farmer needs to transport all this feed in two trips, the capacity of the truck per trip will be half of the total weight.\n\nLet's break down the calculation and implement it in Python using the required format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight for each type of feed:**\n   - Sugar cubes: \\(2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 1 \\text{ pound per box} = 2 \\text{ pounds}\\)\n   - Carrots: \\(4 \\text{ bags} \\times 12 \\text{ pounds per bag} = 48 \\text{ pounds}\\)\n   - Hay: \\(42 \\text{ bales} \\times 75 \\text{ pounds per bale} = 3150 \\text{ pounds}\\)\n   - Oats: \\(20 \\text{ sacks} \\times 65 \\text{ pounds per sack} = 1300 \\text{ pounds}\\)\n\n2. **Sum the weights to get the total weight of feed:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how much the farm truck can carry per trip:**\n   - Since the farmer needs to make 2 trips for all the feed, divide the total weight by 2.\n\n4. **Finally, implement this in Python and print the result.**\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total weight\nsugar_cubes_weight = 2 * 1\ncarrots_weight = 4 * 12\nhay_weight = 42 * 75\noats_weight = 20 * 65\n\n# Sum the weights\ntotal_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight\n\n# Calculate the weight per trip\nweight_per_trip = total_weight / 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(weight_per_trip)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify each component weight:**\n   - Sugar cubes: \\(2\\)\n   - Carrots: \\(48\\)\n   - Hay: \\(3150\\)\n   - Oats: \\(1300\\)\n\n2. **Verify the total weight:**\n   \\[\n   2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify the weight per trip:**\n   \\[\n   4500 \\div 2 = 2250 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter verifying all calculations, we find that the farm truck must carry **2250 pounds** of feed per trip.\n\n\\( \\boxed{2250} \\)"
