Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "To determine how long it will take a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house, given that a single person can paint half of the house in 5 days, we will proceed as follows:\n\n**Key Idea:** We need to calculate the work rate of one person and then use it to find the time required for 5 people to complete the painting task.\n\n### Step-by-step Process:\n\n1. **Work Rate of One Person:**\n   - If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then their work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) house per 5 days. \n   - Therefore, their work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) house per day.\n\n2. **Work Rate of Five People:**\n   - The work rate for 5 people would be 5 times the work rate of one person.\n   - So, work rate of 5 people is \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) house per day.\n\n3. **Time Required to Paint One Whole House:**\n   - We need to find the time \\( t \\) it takes to paint a whole house \\( 1 \\) when working at the rate of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) house per day.\n   - Setting up the equation: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times t = 1 \\)\n\n   Solving for \\( t \\):\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \\ \\text{days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert Days to Hours:**\n   - Convert 2 days into hours (assuming a standard 24-hour day): \n   - \\( 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\) hours\n\nThus, it will take a team of 5 people \\( 48 \\) hours to paint the entire house.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Check work rate calculations:**\n   - Single person work rate: \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of a house per day is consistent with \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) house in 5 days.\n   - Team work rate: \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) house per day is correct.\n\n2. **Check time to paint a whole house:**\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times t = 1 \\) solving leads to \\( t = 2 \\) days, which aligns with calculations.\n\n3. **Convert days to hours accurately:**\n   - \\( 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\) hours is correct conversion.\n\nI am confident that all calculations and steps are accurate. Therefore, the total time required for a team of 5 people to paint an entire house is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]"
