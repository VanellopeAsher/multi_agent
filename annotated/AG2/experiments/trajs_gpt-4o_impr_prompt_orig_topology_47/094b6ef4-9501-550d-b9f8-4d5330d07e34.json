Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. If the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length, how long is the shark?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use an algebraic approach. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define the problem's variables: \n   - Let \\( s \\) represent the length of the shark in inches.\n\n2. Utilize the given information:\n   - The combined length of the remoras is \\( 2 \\times 6 \\) inches, which is \\( 12 \\) inches.\n   - The remoras' total length is 10% of the shark's length. Thus, \\( 0.1s \\).\n\n3. Set up an equation using the given relationship:\n   \\[\n   0.1s = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve the equation for \\( s \\).\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\ns = symbols('s')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(0.1 * s, 12)\n\n# Solve the equation\nshark_length = solve(equation, s)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\nBy solving this equation, we find that the length of the shark is \\( \\boxed{120} \\) inches.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. Calculate 10% of the shark's length (which we've calculated as 120 inches):\n   \\[\n   0.1 \\times 120 = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   This matches the total length of the remoras given in the problem, confirming the solution is correct.\n\nThus, the length of the shark is indeed \\( \\boxed{120} \\) inches."
