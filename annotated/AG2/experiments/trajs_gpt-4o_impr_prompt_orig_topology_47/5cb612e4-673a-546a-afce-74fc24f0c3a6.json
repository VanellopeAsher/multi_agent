Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. Each bag of wheat weighs 60 pounds. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags the trader sold to make a total profit of $400. Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Cost Calculation**:\n   - The cost price for each bag of wheat is $20.\n   - The transportation cost for each bag is $2.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for each bag is \\(20 + 2 = 22\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Selling Price Calculation**:\n   - The selling price for each bag is $30.\n\n3. **Profit Calculation**:\n   - The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost, which is \\(30 - 22 = 8\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Total Profit**:\n   - We are given that the trader made a total profit of $400.\n   - If the profit per bag is $8, then the number of bags \\( n \\) sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:\n     \\[ n = \\frac{400}{8} \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the number of bags using Python.\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step solution using sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the profit per bag and total profit\nprofit_per_bag = 8\ntotal_profit = 400\n\n# Calculate the number of bags\nn_bags = total_profit / profit_per_bag\n\n# Print the result\nprint(n_bags)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the calculations:\n- The trader buys each bag for $20 and pays $2 for transport, bringing the total cost to $22 per bag.\n- He sells each bag for $30, hence making a profit of \\(30 - 22 = 8\\) dollars per bag.\n- To achieve a profit of $400, he needs to sell \\(\\frac{400}{8} = 50\\) bags.\n\nAll checks align correctly with the calculation, and thus our result is correct.\n\nThe number of bags he sold is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{50}\\]"
