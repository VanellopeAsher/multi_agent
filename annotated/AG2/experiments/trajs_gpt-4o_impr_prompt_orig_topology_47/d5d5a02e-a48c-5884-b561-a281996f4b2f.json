Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

Emil's dad's age when Emil turns 26 will be 52 years.\n2. Emil's brother's age when Emil turns 26 will be 13 years.\n\nSince Emil will be 26 five years from now (because Emil is currently 21 years old), we can express the ages of Emil's dad and brother five years from now using the following equations:\n\n1. \\( x + 5 = 52 \\) (Dad's age in 5 years)\n2. \\( y + 5 = 13 \\) (Brother's age in 5 years)\n\nWe can solve these equations to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary function \nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Create equations\nequation1 = Eq(x + 5, 52)\nequation2 = Eq(y + 5, 13)\n\n# Solve for x and y\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (x, y))\ndad_age_now = solution[x]\nbrother_age_now = solution[y]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the ages now\nsum_of_ages = dad_age_now + brother_age_now\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"The sum of the dad's and brother's current ages is: {sum_of_ages}\")\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- From equation \\( x + 5 = 52 \\), solving gives \\( x = 47 \\).\n- From equation \\( y + 5 = 13 \\), solving gives \\( y = 8 \\).\n- Thus, the dad's current age is 47 and the brother's current age is 8.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages now is \\( 47 + 8 = 55 \\).\n\nFinal result:\n\\(\\boxed{55}\\)"

Here's the solution summarized:\n\n- We define the current ages using the conditions when Emil turns 26.\n- Emil is now 21 years old; thus, he will be 26 in 5 years.\n- The equations for future ages were set up based on the conditions at that time:\n  1. Emil's dad will be \\(2 \\times 26 = 52\\).\n  2. Emil's brother will be \\(\\frac{26}{2} = 13\\).\n\nWe solved these equations:\n\n1. \\( x + 5 = 52 \\) gives \\( x = 47 \\) (current dad's age).\n2. \\( y + 5 = 13 \\) gives \\( y = 8 \\) (current brother's age).\n\nThe sum of the dad's and brother's current ages is:\n\\[ \n47 + 8 = 55 \n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{55}\n\\]\n\nThe problem is complete, and the solution has been verified accurately.
