Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a combination of reasoning based on the information given and calculations. We'll break down the problem step by step:\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.\n   - On Tuesday, she wrote \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more articles than Monday.\n   - She spent 104 hours in total over three days writing articles.\n   - Each article takes 4 hours to write.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Articles Written on Tuesday:**\n   - If she wrote 5 articles on Monday, \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more means she wrote \\(5 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 5\\right)\\) articles on Tuesday.\n   - Simplifying this: \\(5 + 2 = 7\\) articles.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation for the Total Hours:**\n   - Number of articles on Monday = 5 \\(\\implies\\) Total hours on Monday = \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) hours.\n   - Number of articles on Tuesday = 7 \\(\\implies\\) Total hours on Tuesday = \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\) hours.\n   - Let \\(x\\) be the number of articles written on Wednesday. Then the total hours spent on Wednesday = \\(4x\\).\n\n4. **Establish the Total Hours Equation:**\n   - Total hours: \\(20 + 28 + 4x = 104\\).\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   20 + 28 + 4x = 104\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   48 + 4x = 104\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4x = 104 - 48\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4x = 56\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{56}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 14\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the Ratio of Articles Written on Wednesday Compared to Tuesday:**\n   - Articles on Tuesday = 7, Articles on Wednesday = 14.\n   - Ratio = \\(\\frac{14}{7} = 2\\).\n\nThe result should be presented in a clear, final statement.\n\n```python\nprint(\"The number of times as many articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday compared to Tuesday is:\", 2)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Monday: 5 articles = 20 hours\n2. Tuesday: 7 articles = 28 hours\n3. Wednesday: 14 articles = 56 hours\n4. Total = 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours (which matches the given information).\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct, and the ratio of articles written on Wednesday to Tuesday is indeed \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
