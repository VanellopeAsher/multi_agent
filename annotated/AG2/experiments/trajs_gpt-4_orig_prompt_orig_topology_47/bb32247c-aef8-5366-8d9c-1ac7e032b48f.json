You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

We know that it doubles in the second week, so by the end of the second week, its height is 2h. In the third week, it grows by an additional 4 inches, so its final height is 2h + 4. We cannot give an exact numerical answer without knowing the initial height, but we can present the final height as a function of the initial height.\n\nHere is the Python code to represent this:\n\n```python\ndef beanstalk_height(initial_height):\n    # Second week\n    height_after_second_week = 2 * initial_height\n\n    # Third week\n    height_after_third_week = height_after_second_week + 4\n\n    # Print out the final height\n    print(f'The height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is {height_after_third_week} inches, given that the initial height was {initial_height} inches.')\n```\n\nYou can use this function, replacing `initial_height` with the actual initial height of the beanstalk in inches."
