His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is planning a birthday party and wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the geometry of the situation. The backyard fence is rectangular in shape with a long side measuring 20 feet, and a short side measuring 15 feet. Therefore, to cover the entire fence with crepe paper, James needs to calculate the perimeter of the fence. \n\nHere is the python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\n# Define the lengths of the sides\nlong_side = 20\nshort_side = 15\n\n# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle by multiplying the lengths of the sides by 2\ntotal_paper_needed = 2 * (long_side + short_side)\n\nprint(total_paper_needed)\n```\n\nThis should give you the total length of crepe paper that James needs to buy for his fence."
