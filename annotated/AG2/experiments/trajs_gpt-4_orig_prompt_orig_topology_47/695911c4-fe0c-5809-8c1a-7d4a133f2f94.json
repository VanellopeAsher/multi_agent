After 10 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

      "content": "This problem can be solved by calculating the total amount spent by Pauline in two phases: the first 10 years when the fee was constant and the next 3 years when the fee increased by 150%.\n\nLet's begin by applying these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount spent by Pauline in the first 10 years. This can be done by multiplying the number of visits per year (3) by the cost of each visit ($10) and by the number of years (10).\n2. Calculate the new cost of each visit after the increase. This can be done by adding 150% of the initial cost to the initial cost itself.\n3. Calculate the total amount spent by Pauline in the next 3 years. This can be done by multiplying the number of visits per year (3) by the new cost of each visit and by the number of years (3).\n4. Add the total amounts from step 1 and step 3 to get the grand total spent by Pauline.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# given values\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10\nvisits_per_year = 3\ninitial_years = 10\nincrease_percentage = 150/100\nadditional_years = 3\n\n# calculating total cost for initial 10 years\ntotal_cost_initial_years = initial_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * initial_years\n\n# calculating new cost per visit after increase\nnew_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit * (1 + increase_percentage)\n\n# calculating total cost for next 3 years\ntotal_cost_additional_years = new_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * additional_years\n\n# calculating grand total spent by Pauline\ngrand_total = total_cost_initial_years + total_cost_additional_years\n\n# printing the grand total\nprint(grand_total)\n```\n\nFinally we can calculate the output by running the above Python code."
