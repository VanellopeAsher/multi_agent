You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nSince the sun is moving at a certain degree per hour, we can multiply the rate of movement by the number of hours to get how many degrees the sun has moved. \n\nWe start from the angle of the pyramids, which is 32 degrees from the ground. For the first 10 hours, the sun is moving at 5 degrees per hour, so we add 5*10 to 32. \n\nThe next 2 hours, the sun is moving at a rate of 3 degrees per hour, so we add 2*3 to the total we already have. \n\nThis can all be calculated directly with Python. \n\nHere is the Python Code:\n\n```python\n# Initial angle from the pyramid to the ground\npyr_angle = 32\n# Rate of the sun's movement for the first 10 hours\nrate1 = 5\n# Rate of the sun's movement for the next 2 hours\nrate2 = 3\n# Duration of the sun's movement for the first and second phases\nduration1 = 10\nduration2 = 2\n# Calculation\ntotal_angle = pyr_angle + rate1*duration1 + rate2*duration2\nprint(total_angle)\n```\n\nAfter you run this code, you should get the total degrees from the ground to the sun."
