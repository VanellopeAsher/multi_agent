You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home.

The problem states that two-thirds of students have a desktop, which means 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the students do not have a desktop computer. By setting up and solving the equation 1/3 * x = 30, we can solve for x. \n\nLet's solve the problem using Python. We will use sympy to handle the algebra. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# equation representing the proportion of students without a desktop\nequation = Eq(1/3 * x, 30)\n\n# solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\nprint(solution[0])\n```"
