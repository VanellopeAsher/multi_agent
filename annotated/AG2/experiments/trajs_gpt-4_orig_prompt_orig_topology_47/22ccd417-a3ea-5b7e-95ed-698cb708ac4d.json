You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nThe problem can be handled via the second method, i.e., with reasoning.\n\nReasoning:\nLet's denote the volume of the first medicine that Saanvi takes each time as \"X\". Given that the second medicine is three times that of the first one, its volume will be \"3X\". \n\nNow we know that their sum - the total volume of two medicines, is represented as \"4X\". Given that 448 mL were used in 8 doses, we can see that she takes \"4X\" each time. \n\nNow we divide 448 by 8 to get \"4X\", then divide the result by 4 to find how many mL of the first medicine (X) Saanvi is taking each time. \n\nFirst, we can calculate the total volume Saanvi is taking each time. \n\n```python\ntotal_volume_per_dose = 448 / 8\nprint(total_volume_per_dose)\n```\n\nAfter getting 4X, we can calculate the volume of the first medicine (X) by dividing the total volume per dose by 4.\n\n```python\nvolume_of_first_medicine = total_volume_per_dose / 4\nprint(volume_of_first_medicine)\n```"
