You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home.

      "content": "The key idea for this problem is to set up a system of equations based off the conditions given in the problem and then solve that system of equations.\n\nFrom the problem, we can infer two equations:\n1. The number of students with a desktop is three-fourths of the total number of students.\n2. The number of students without a desktop or laptop, represented by the 20 students without a desktop, is one-third of the total number of students without a desktop.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equations:\n\nLet x represent the total number of students.\n\n1. (3/4)x = the number of students that have desktops at home.\n2. 1/3 * (x - (3/4)x) = 20\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using Python to find the total number of students.\n\nLet's plan our python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# 1. Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# 2. Set up the equation\neq = Eq(1/3*(x - (3/4)*x), 20)\n\n# 3. Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(eq, x)\n\n# 4. Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nNow we run these steps in python, find the solution and move to the next step."
