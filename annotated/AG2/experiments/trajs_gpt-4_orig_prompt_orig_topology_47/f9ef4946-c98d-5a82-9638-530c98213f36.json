On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he had to stay up late over the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes. How many hours did he watch TV in total?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework.

Finally, express the result in hours.\n\nLet's write the Python code for it. We will use the Python library sympy. It will allow us to perform mathematical calculations and also keep results in fractions and whatnot. We will be storing the time for each day in variables and then summing them up.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define how long he watches TV every day\nmon_tue_hour = Rational(1) * 2  # Monday and Tuesday, 1 hour each day\nwed_hour = Rational(30, 60) * 3  # Wednesday, 3 episodes 30 minutes each\nthu_hour = Rational(1) + Rational(30, 60)  # Thursday, 1.5 hours\nfri_hour = Rational(1) * 2  # Friday, 2 hours\n\n# Sum all the hours\ntotal_hours = mon_tue_hour + wed_hour + thu_hour + fri_hour\n\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the total hour Frankie watched TV from Monday to Friday. The `Rational` object in sympy allows the results to be kept in fractions. By using `Rational(a, b)`, we create a `Rational` object representing `a/b`."
