You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball.

However, we know that all of them are either boys or girls, and we know there are 22 girls. Therefore, there are n - 22 boys. \n\nBy adding up the number of students in all groups, we get the total number of students. Let's calculate it.\n\n```python\n# number of tennis players\ntennis_players = 6\n\n# number of volleyball players\nvolleyball_players = 2 * tennis_players\n\n# number of soccer players (both boys and girls)\nsoccer_players = 22 # just girls, we don't know how many boys are playing soccer\n\n# total number of students\ntotal_students = tennis_players + volleyball_players + soccer_players\n\nprint(f\"The total number of students is {total_students}.\")\n```"
