You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGriffin had 30 french fries, but Kyle took 6 of them.

So the fries Griffin had became 24 - 12 = 12.\nThen, Ginger gave Griffin some fries, we don't know the exact number yet, that's the answer we are seeking.\nLastly, Colby took from Griffin 3 less than Kyle had taken, which means Colby took 6 - 3 = 3 fries. After all these operations, Griffin had 33 fries.\n\nSummarizing the sequence of operations we have:\n30 - 6 (Kyle took) - 2*6 (Billy took) + Unknown (Ginger gave) - (6 - 3) (Colby took) = 33\n\nWe can use Python to calculate the unknown, which is the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin."
