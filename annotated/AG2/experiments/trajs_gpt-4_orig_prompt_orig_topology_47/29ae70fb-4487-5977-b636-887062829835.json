  "problem": "Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. Manny also signed up for a painting class that costs $30, but his parents don't care about the cost of this class.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the cost per class. The parents don't want the karate classes to exceed $10 per class. We know that the total cost for the karate classes is $60 and that the total number of classes is 10. Hence, the cost per class if Manny attends all classes would be $60/10, which is $6 per class. Initially, we will assume that Manny does not miss any classes.\n\nThe criteria that Manny's parents have set is that they won't sign him up again if the classes end up costing more than $10 per class. This occurs when the total cost ($60) is divided by the number of classes Manny has attended. We can then decrease the number of attended classes until the cost per class increases to $10.\n\nLet's solve this with Python, setting up an equation to solve for the maximum number of Karate classes Manny can miss before the cost per class becomes more than $10.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\nattended_classes = symbols('x')\n\n# The equation is total cost divided by attended classes = 10\nequation = 60/attended_classes - 10\n\nmissed_classes = solve(equation)[0]\nmissed_classes = round(missed_classes, 0)\nprint(\"Number of classes Manny can miss:\", 10-missed_classes)\n``` \n\nThis Python code will solve for the number of attended classes given the equation, and then calculate the number of missed classes by subtracting the attended classes from the total number of classes."
