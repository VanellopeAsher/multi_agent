You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

His dad will then be twice his age, so 52 years old, and his brother will be half his age, so 13 years old.\n2. Therefore, now (5 years earlier), Emil's dad is 52 - 5 = 47 years old, and Emil's brother is 13 - 5 = 8 years old.\n3. The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 47 + 8.\n\nWe can calculate the last step using Python."
