You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters.

To find the total age of the siblings, we just need to sum the age of each individual (or group of individuals).\n\nThe Python code for this problem is quite straight forward:\n\n```python\n# Start with the age of sisters. Since they are all of the same age, we can multiply their age by the number of sisters.\nsisters_age = 16 * 10\n\n# Then consider the age of the brothers. One brother is 12 years old and the other brother is twice as old as him.\nbrothers_age = 12 + 12 * 2\n\n# The total age is the sum of the ages calculated above\ntotal_age = sisters_age + brothers_age\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nThis program calculates separately the ages of the sisters and the brothers, then sums them to get the total age."
