You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is to use the relationship between their ages and their total age, and the ratio of their ages. We will use sympy's `Eq` to create an equation and `solve` to solve the equation. Here is the plan:\n1. Define two variables, Darrell's age (d_Age) and Allen's age (a_Age).\n2. According to the problem, their ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This translates to an equation: d_Age/a_Age = 7/11.\n3. The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162. This translates to another equation: d_Age + a_Age = 162.\n4. Solve these two equations simultaneously to get the values of d_Age and a_Age.\n5. Allen's age 10 years from now is a_Age + 10.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nd_Age, a_Age = symbols('d_Age a_Age')\n\n# Set up the equations\neq1 = Eq(d_Age/a_Age, 7/11)\neq2 = Eq(d_Age + a_Age, 162)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (d_Age, a_Age))\n\n# Allen's age 10 years from now\nfuture_a_Age = solution[a_Age] + 10\nprint(future_a_Age)\n```\nWe can run this code to get the answer."
