You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\n48 people are riding a bus.

Which is the original number of people plus 5 times of the number who got off from the bus minus the 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. Second, we calculate the number of people left in the bus after the second stop. Which is the number of passengers before the second stop minus the number of people who get off at the second stop plus the number of passengers who get on at the second stop.\n\nThis problem is straightforward and can be solved by writing a Python program.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this: \n\n```python\n# initialize number of passengers\npassengers = 48\n\n# first stop operations\ngot_off = 8\ngot_on = 5 * got_off - 2\npassengers = passengers - got_off + got_on\n\n# second stop operations\ngot_off = 21\ngot_on = int(got_off / 3)\npassengers = passengers - got_off + got_on\n\n# print final number of passengers\nprint(passengers)\n```"
