Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

So we subtract Wednesday's depth from Tuesday's, divide it by 2, and add it to Wednesday's depth.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this step by step.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# depth of water on Monday\nmonday_depth = 17\n\n# depth of water on Tuesday\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + 7\n\n# depth of water on Wednesday\nwednesday_depth = tuesday_depth * 2 / 3\n\n# difference between Tuesday and Wednesday\ndifference = tuesday_depth - wednesday_depth\n\n# depth of water on Thursday\nthursday_depth = wednesday_depth + difference / 2\n\nprint(thursday_depth)\n```\n\nNow let's run this program and get the depth of water on Thursday."
