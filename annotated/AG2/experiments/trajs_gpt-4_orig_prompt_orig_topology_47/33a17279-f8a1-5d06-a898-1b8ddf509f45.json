You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each.

Then, we subtract the money she gave to her sisters and the amount she donated to charity to find out how much money she has left over.\n\nNow let's implement this in python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes\ntotal_earnings = 80 * 1 + 60 * 4\n\n# Money she gave to her sisters and donated to charity\nexpenses = 10 * 2 + 15\n\n# Calculating the money left over\nmoney_left = total_earnings - expenses\n\nprint(money_left)\n```"
