You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and bought 50. Their total bandages X changed to X - 38 + 50.\n3. On the second day, they used 10 bandages less than the previous day (38 - 10 = 28 bandages), so the bandages changed to X - 38 + 50 - 28.\n4. On the third day, they bought 2*50 bandages and used half a pack (50/2 = 25 bandages), so the remaining bandages become X - 38 + 50 - 28 + 2*50 - 25.\n5. According to the problem, at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages remaining, so we can create the equation: X - 38 + 50 - 28 + 2*50 - 25 = 78.\n\nBy solving this equation, we can find out the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day.\n\nI'm going to generate the Python code to solve this equation and get the value of X."
