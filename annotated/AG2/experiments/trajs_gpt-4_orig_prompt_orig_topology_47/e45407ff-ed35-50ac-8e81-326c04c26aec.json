You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

The number of cognac bottles is twice the number of scotch bottles bought.\nStep 4: Finally, add up the total cost for the scotch and the cognac to get the total amount spent. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Number of scotch bottles bought\nscotch_bottles = 10\n\n# Total cost of scotch bottles\ntotal_scotch_cost = 600\n\n# Cost per bottle of scotch\nscotch_cost_per_bottle = total_scotch_cost / scotch_bottles\n\n# Cost per bottle of cognac\ncognac_cost_per_bottle = scotch_cost_per_bottle + 0.5 * scotch_cost_per_bottle\n\n# Number of cognac bottles bought\ncognac_bottles = 2 * scotch_bottles\n\n# Total cost of cognac\ntotal_cognac_cost = cognac_cost_per_bottle * cognac_bottles\n\n# Total amount spent\ntotal_cost = total_scotch_cost + total_cognac_cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\nThe final answer will be the total cost which includes the cost of both scotch and cognac bottles."
