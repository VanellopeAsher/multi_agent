However, on Fridays, he spends an additional 2 hours at work due to high call volumes. How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

      "content": "The key here is to first find out how many calls Tim can handle in an hour, and then multiply it with the total hours he works in a week.\n\nThe calculation goes in three steps:\n1. Calculate the number of calls he can handle in one hour.\n2. Calculate the total hours of work in a week.\n3. Multiply step 1 and step 2 to find the total number of calls.\n\nHere is how we can do it using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of minutes in an hour\nminutes_per_hour = 60\n\n# time taken by Tim to deal with one call \ntime_per_call = 15 \n\n# number of calls he can handle in one hour\ncalls_per_hour = minutes_per_hour / time_per_call\n\n# daily working hours\ndaily_work_hours = 6 \n\n# extra hours on Friday\nextra_work_hours = 2 \n\n# total working hours in a week, considering 4 days with normal hours and\n# Friday with an extra 2 hours\ntotal_work_hours = 4* daily_work_hours + daily_work_hours + extra_work_hours \n\n# total calls in a week\ntotal_calls = total_work_hours * calls_per_hour\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_calls)\n```\n\nNow you can run this Python code, and the output will be the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5 day work week."
