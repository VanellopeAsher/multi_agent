Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees.

Then we can solve the equation to obtain the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, so the number of apples that she gathers from the shortest trees is `30/2 = 15`.\n2. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so Joanne's sister gathers `2*30 = 60` apples from the tallest trees.\n3. Joanne and her sister have gathered a combined total of 500 apples. From the problem we know\n   ```\n   Joanne_total = Joanne_tallest + Joanne_shortest + Joanne_avearage\n   Joanne's_sister_total = Sister_tallest + Sister_shortest\n   ```\n   and\n   ```\n   Total = Joanne_total + Joanne's_sister_total\n   ```\n   where\n   ```\n   Joanne_tallest = 30\n   Joanne_average = 350\n   Joanne_shortest = 15\n   sister_tallest = 60\n   ```\n   We can substitute these variables into the equation to get\n   ```\n   500 = (30 + 350 + 15) + (60 + Sister_shortest)\n   ```\n   Solve this equation to get the number of apples that Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.\n\nLet's use Python to solve this equations."
