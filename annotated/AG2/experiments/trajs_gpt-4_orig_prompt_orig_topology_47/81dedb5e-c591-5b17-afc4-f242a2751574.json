You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

First, he divides the total length into 4 equal parts, and then each of those parts is divided into 5 equal parts. Thus, each final cut will be 1/4th of the total length first, and then 1/5th of that.\n\nLet's designate the length of the ribbon as 'L'. The length of each final cut will be (1/4)*(1/5)*L or L/20.\n\nHere's the Python code to represent this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify\n\nL = symbols('L')  # Total length of the ribbon\n\n# Length of each final cut\nfinal_cut = simplify((1/4)*(1/5)*L)\n\nprint(\"The length of each final cut is:\", final_cut)\n```\n\nYou can replace 'L' with the actual length if you have a specific number."
