You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches, so the shark's body length (represented by S) can be found by solving the equation 12 = 0.1 * S.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Variable definition\nS = sp.symbols('S')\n\n# Equation definition\nequation = sp.Eq(12, 0.1 * S)\n\n# Solve the equation\nshark_length = sp.solve(equation, S)\n\n# Print the length of the shark\nprint('The length of the shark is', shark_length[0], 'inches.')\n```\nRun this code and replace S with the result to get the answer."
