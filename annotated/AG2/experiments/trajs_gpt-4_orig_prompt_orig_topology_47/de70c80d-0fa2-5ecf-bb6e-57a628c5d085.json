You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

Let's denote the number of letters in the alphabet as a.\n\n1. Elise writes the alphabet in full three times. The number of letters written in this step is 3*a.\n2. Elise writes half of the alphabet once. The number of letters written in this step is 1*a/2.\n3. Elise re-writes everything she has already written. The number of letters written in this step is the sum of all the letters she has written before.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate the total number of letters written by Elise. We'll denote the total number of letters as total.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of letters in the alphabet\na = 26\n\n# number of letters written by Elise\ntotal = 3*a + 1*a/2 + 2*(3*a + 1*a/2)\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\nThis python code computes the total number of letters written by Elise by summing up the letters written each time. Let's run it and find out the total."
