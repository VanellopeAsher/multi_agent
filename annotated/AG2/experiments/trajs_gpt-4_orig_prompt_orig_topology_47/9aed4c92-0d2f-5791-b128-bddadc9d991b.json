You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark has $50.5 in his bank account.

This can be done by subtracting Mark's current account balance from the cost of the bike, and then dividing the difference by the amount Mark earns per day. The formula to be used is:\n\nNumber of days = (Cost of bike - Initial amount) / Amount earned per day\n\nLet's plug into the formula and find out the answer.\n\nNOTE: Since we can't have partial days, if the result is a decimal, we will need to round up to the next whole day.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sympy as sp\n\ncost_of_bike = 300.5\ninitial_amount = 50.5\nearned_per_day = 12.5\n\ndays_needed = sp.Rational(cost_of_bike - initial_amount, earned_per_day)\ndays_needed = math.ceil(days_needed.evalf())\n\nprint(days_needed)\n```"
