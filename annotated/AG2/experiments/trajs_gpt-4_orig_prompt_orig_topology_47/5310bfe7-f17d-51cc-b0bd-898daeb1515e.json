You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

Given that Richie scored 90 goals, the number of goals Mark scored can be found by subtracting 30 from Richie's goals and the number of goals Anna scored by subtracting 55 from Richie's goals. The total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is the sum of their individual goals.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Richie's score\nRichie = 90\n\n# Mark's score\nMark = Richie - 30\n\n# Anna's score\nAnna = Richie - 55\n\n# Total score\ntotal_score = Richie + Mark + Anna\n\n# Print the total score\nprint(total_score)\n```"
