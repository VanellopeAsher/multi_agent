You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

The given profit is $160.\n\nThe cost price of a bag is $4 / 5 = $0.8, and the selling price of a bag is $8. The profit on a bag is the selling price - cost price. \n\nLet's assume that x is the number of packs Tara has bought.\n\nSo the profit of each bag times the total number of bags (which is 5x) should be equal to the total profit, $160.\n\nThe equation that can be formed from the above information is:\n(8 - 0.8) * 5x = 160\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the number of packs Tara bought.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# define the equation\neq = (8 - 0.8) * 5*x - 160\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = sp.solve(eq, x)\n\nprint(solution)\n```"

She then sold each bag for $8, making a profit of $8 - $0.8 = $7.2 per bag.\n\nThe total profit she made was $160. \n\nTo find out how many bags she sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag - so $160 / $7.2.\n\nSince each pack contains 5 bags, we must further divide this result by 5 to find out how many packs of bags she bought and sold.\n\nLet's correct this calculation.\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of packs\nnum_bags = 160 / 7.2\nnum_packs = num_bags / 5\n\nprint(num_packs)\n```"

This means she made a profit of $8 - $0.80 = 7.20 per bag.\n\nGiven that her total profit was $160, the number of bags she must have sold is $160 / $7.20.\n\nSince each pack contains 5 bags, the number of packs she bought is equal to the number of bags divided by 5.\n\nLet's redo this calculation.\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of bags sold\nnum_bags = 160 / 7.2\n# calculate the number of packs bought\nnum_packs = num_bags / 5\n\nprint(num_packs)\n```"

We divide the number of bags by 5 to get the number of packs.\n\nWe will write a program to illustrate this.\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of bags sold\nnum_bags = 160 / 7.2\n# round up to the nearest whole number because she can't sell fractional bags\nnum_bags = round(num_bags)\n# calculate the number of packs bought (and sold)\nnum_packs = num_bags / 5\n# round up to the nearest whole number because she can't buy fractional packs\nnum_packs = round(num_packs)\n\nprint(num_packs)\n```"
