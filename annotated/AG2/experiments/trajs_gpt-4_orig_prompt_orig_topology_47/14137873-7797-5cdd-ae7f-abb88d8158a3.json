So, before that, we had 5+1 = 6 french fries.\nStep 2: These 6 fries were 1/3 of what was left after the pigeons ate. So, multiply by 3 to find out what we had before: 6 * 3 = 18\nStep 3: Before the pigeons ate, we had 18 + 9 = 27 fries (because, according to the problem, three pigeons ate three fries each).\nStep 4: These 27 fries were half of what was left after the seagull ate. So, we had 27 * 2 = 54 fries after the seagull and before the pigeons.\nStep 5: Before the seagull ate, we had 54 + 7 = 61 fries (because the seagull ate half of what the person had eaten, which was 14 fries, so the seagull ate 7 fries)\nStep 6: Finally, before the person started eating, we had 61 + 14 = 75 fries\n\nLet's use Python to verify this calculation.\n"

Adding that to 18 gives us 27 french fries,\n \nBefore the seagull ate half the fries Dave had eaten:\n- The seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Adding 7 to 27 gives us 34 french fries.\n\nBefore Dave ate:\n- There were 14 french fries eaten by Dave. Adding 14 to 34, that totals 48 french fries.\n\nLet's now verify these calculations with Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: After the ants\nfries_after_ants = 5\n\n# Step 2: Before the raccoon\nfries_before_raccoon = fries_after_ants * 3 + 1\n\n# Step 3: Before the pigeons\nfries_before_pigeons = fries_before_raccoon + 3 * 3\n\n# Step 4: Before the seagull\nfries_before_seagull = fries_before_pigeons + 7\n\n# Step 5: Before Dave\ninitial_fries = fries_before_seagull + 14\n\nprint(\"The initial quantity of french fries in the packet that Dave purchased was\", initial_fries)\n```\n\nThe output of this program should be:\n```shell\nThe initial quantity of french fries in the packet that Dave purchased was 48\n```\n\nBut according to your result, the initial quantity of french fries in the packet that Dave purchased was 64. \n\nI realize I miscalculated the number of fries the seagull ate. It ate half the number of fries that Dave ate, but equation we presented counted those twice. Let's correct this. The seagull ate half of 14 fries (which Dave ate), so that's 7 fries. Therefore, after the seagull ate, the number of fries should be increased by 7 only once.\n\nAnd before Dave ate, that's 34 french fries (not 14).\n\nTherefore, the correct total would be:\nDave's fries (14) + full quantity after seagull snatched packet (34) = 48 french fries.\n\nGiven that this doesn't match the provided result, there seems to be a mistake either in the steps or the provided result.
