You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThis problem is related to the concept of work and rate in which more workers can accomplish a certain task in less time. Here, 5 individuals will be able to paint a house faster than a single individual. We can derive the rate at which one person paints the house, and use that to calculate the time it will take for a team of five individuals to paint the house. \n\nNow let's solve it using Python. We will use the sympy package to make sure fractions are represented correctly. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Time for one individual to paint the whole house\ntime_single_whole = 2 * 5  # days\n\n# Rate of work for one individual\nrate_single = sp.Rational(1, time_single_whole)  # houses per day\n\n# Rate of work for five individuals\nrate_five = 5 * rate_single  # houses per day\n\n# Time for five individuals to paint one house\ntime_five_whole = sp.Rational(1, rate_five)  # days\n\n# Convert days to hours\ntime_five_whole_hours = time_five_whole * 24  # hours\n\n# Print the result\nprint(sp.simplify(time_five_whole_hours))  # hours\n```\nThis will show us how many hours it will take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house."
