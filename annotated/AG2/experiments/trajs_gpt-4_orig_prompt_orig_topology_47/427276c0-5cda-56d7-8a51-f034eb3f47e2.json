You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels.

      "content": "The key idea to solve the problem is to compute the average height of heels. The formula to compute the average is:\n\nAverage = Total sum / Total counts\n\nSo, we will add all heels' heights and then divide by the total number of heels to find the average height of the heels at the party.\n\nIn Python, this can be done directly. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n# number of high heels\nhigh_heels_count = 3\n# height of high heels\nhigh_heels_height = 4.5\n\n# number of low heels\nlow_heels_count = 3\n# height of low heels\nlow_heels_height = 2.5\n\n# total_sum = high heels height * count of high heels + low heels height * count of low heels\ntotal_sum = high_heels_height * high_heels_count + low_heels_height * low_heels_count\n\n# total_count = count of high heels + count of low heels\ntotal_count = high_heels_count + low_heels_count\n\n# average = total_sum / total_count\naverage_height = total_sum / total_count\n\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nPlease run this code and give me the output."
