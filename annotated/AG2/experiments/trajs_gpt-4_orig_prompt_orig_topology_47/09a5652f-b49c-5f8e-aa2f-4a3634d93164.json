You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and a half as much the other two days he runs. He rests for 2 hours after each run. How fast does he run?"

Here's what we know:\n- John runs a total of 60 miles over 3 days per week.\n- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n- On the other two days, he runs for half as long as on the first day, so he runs for 1.5 hours on each of those days.\n\nNext, we need to find how many total hours John runs per week, and finally, we will divide the total miles he runs by the total hours he runs to find his average speed.\n\nHere's how you would write it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Total miles John runs every week\ntotal_miles = 60\n\n# Time for running each day\nday1_time = 3  # hours\nday2_time = day3_time = 0.5 * day1_time  # hours\n\n# Total running time for the week\ntotal_time = day1_time + day2_time + day3_time  # hours\n\n# Compute John's average running speed (miles/hour)\naverage_speed = total_miles / total_time\n\nprint(average_speed)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the average speed using the above Python script and share the result."
