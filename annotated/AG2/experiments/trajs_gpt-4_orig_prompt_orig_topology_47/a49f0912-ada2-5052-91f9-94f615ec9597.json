You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

We can calculate sightseeing time by multiplying total time by 0.40. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculations. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# step 1\nboating_time = 60\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 30 * 20\ntotal_activities_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time\n\n# step 2\ntotal_time = shows_time / 0.30\n\n#step 3\nsightseeing_time = total_time * 0.40\n\nsp.pprint(sightseeing_time)\n```"
