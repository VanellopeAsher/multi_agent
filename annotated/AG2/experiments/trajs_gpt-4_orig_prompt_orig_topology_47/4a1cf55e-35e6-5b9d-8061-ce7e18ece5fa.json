You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar.

Then, we sum the total amount spent on 10 gallon-jars and 16 half-gallon jars.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. We know the cost of a gallon jar is $5.5 and it costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar. So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5.5 - $2.5 = $3.\n2. So, the total cost of 10 gallon-jars is 10 * $5.5 and the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3. \n3. Finally, we can add these totals together to get the final cost.\n\nNow, we will calculate these steps in Python. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# cost of a gallon jar\ngallon_jar_cost = 5.5\n# cost of a half-gallon jar\nhalf_gallon_jar_cost = gallong_jar_cost - 2.5\n\n# total cost of 10 gallon-jars\ntotal_cost_gallon_jars = 10 * gallon_jar_cost\n# total cost of 16 half-gallon jars\ntotal_cost_half_gallon_jars = 16 * half_gallon_jar_cost\n\n# final total cost\nfinal_total_cost = total_cost_gallon_jars + total_cost_half_gallon_jars\n\n# print the final total cost\nprint(final_total_cost)\n```\n\nThe code will output the final total cost."
