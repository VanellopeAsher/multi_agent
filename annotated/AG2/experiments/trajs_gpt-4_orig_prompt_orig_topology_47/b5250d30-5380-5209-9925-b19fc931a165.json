You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery Saturday, Jill along with her companions view 4 films and on Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays.

They continue this routine every weekend for 4 weeks. We need to calculate the total number of films they view in a span of 4 weeks.\n\nWe can solve this problem with Python code directly. We'll first calculate the total number of films they view in one week and then multiply this by the number of weeks.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the total number of films they view in a span of 4 weeks.\n\n```python\n# number of films viewed on Saturday\nfilms_on_saturday = 4\n# number of films viewed on Sunday is half of that on Saturday\nfilms_on_sunday = films_on_saturday / 2\n# total number of films viewed in a week \nfilms_in_a_week = films_on_saturday + films_on_sunday\n# total number of weeks \nweeks = 4\n# total number of films viewed in a span of 4 weeks \ntotal_films = films_in_a_week * weeks\nprint(total_films)\n```"
