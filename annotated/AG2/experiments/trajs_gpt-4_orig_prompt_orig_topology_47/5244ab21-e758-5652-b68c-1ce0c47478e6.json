You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges.

She gave away two boxes to her mother and two boxes to her sibling, so she had left (12-2-2) boxes. She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself, which means she sold the rest, three quarters of the remaining oranges. \n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# total_num_oranges: total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had\ntotal_num_oranges = 12 * 20\n\n# num_boxes_given_away: number of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away to her mother and sibling\nnum_boxes_given_away = 2 * 20 + 2 * 20\n\n# num_left_over_oranges: number of oranges left after giving away some\nnum_left_over_oranges = total_num_oranges - num_boxes_given_away\n\n# num_oranges_sold: number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold\nnum_oranges_sold = sp.Rational(3, 4) * num_left_over_oranges\n\nprint(num_oranges_sold)\n```\nAfter running this code, we will get the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold."
