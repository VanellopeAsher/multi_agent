So, the number of balloons thrown will be the difference between the total number of balloons filled and the number of balloons left.\n\nLet's define:\n\n- `total_balloons` : the total number of balloons filled before the fight, which is a multiple of 30.\n- `balloons_left`: the number of balloons left after the fight, which is 12.\n\nAssumption:\nSince it has not been mentioned how many packs of balloons they have filled, we will assume the total number of balloons to be an integral multiple of 30 because each pack contains 30 balloons.\n\nThen we can calculate the number of balloons thrown as:\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\nWe can use Python to perform the calculation once we know the total number of balloons.\n\nPlease provide the total number of balloons."
