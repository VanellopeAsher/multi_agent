That means he lost a total of 3 months * 10 pounds/month = 30 pounds during the period he was unwell. \n\n2. During the recovery period, Mark regained 5 pounds per month for 2 months. This means he gained a total of 2 months * 5 pounds/month = 10 pounds during his recovery.\n\n3. At the end of his recovery, his weight was 70 pounds. However, this includes the weight he regained during recovery. So, to find his weight at the end of the illness period (which is also the point at which recovery began), we have to subtract the weight gained during recovery from his final weight: 70 pounds - 10 pounds = 60 pounds.\n\n4. Finally, to get Mark's initial weight before he fell ill, we need to add the weight lost during the illness to the weight at the end of illness period (since the weight lost had reduced his weight from the initial weight). So, initial weight = weight at end of illness + weight loss = 60 pounds + 30 pounds = 90 pounds. \n\nSo, Mark's initial weight before he fell ill was 90 pounds."

      "content": "Right, let's proceed by writing Python code to execute these steps and obtain the weight of the Mark before he fell sick.\n\n1. We will first assign the variables to the weights lost each month when Mark was unwell, the weights gained each month during recovery, the number of months Mark was unwell, the number of months Mark took to recover and Mark's final weight after recovery.\n2. Then, we will multiply the weight lost and gained per month with the respective number of months to get the total weights lost during sickness and gained during recovery.\n3. Next, we will subtract the weight gained during recovery from his final weight to get the weight at the end of sickness.\n4. Finally, we will add the weight lost during sickness to the weight at the end of sickness to get the weight before Mark fell sick.\n\nSo, let's compute these via Python."

The final step of both solutions involves adding the weight lost during sickness to the weight at the end of sickness to find the initial weight. However, in the proposed solution, to find the weight at the end of sickness, the total weight gain during recovery is subtracted from the final weight after recovery. Based on these calculations, the proposed initial weight before sickness is 90 pounds in both solutions. Hence, using the information given, I can conclude that the initial weight of Mark before he fell ill was 90 pounds. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{90}"
