Each dozen contains 12 items, so she baked 12 brownies.\n2. At her office, she got half a dozen brownies. Half a dozen is 6, so she got 6 brownies from her office.\n3. Her friends had prepared four dozen brownies. Four dozen is 48, so she received 48 brownies from her friends.\n4. During her party, one and a half dozen brownies were eaten. One and a half dozen is 18, so 18 brownies were consumed at the party.\n\nTo calculate the total number of brownies left, we add the number of brownies she had at the beginning of the day (which includes the ones she baked, the ones she got from her office, and the ones her friends brought) and then subtract the number of brownies eaten at the party.\n\nLet's do this calculation step by step:\n\n1. Add up the brownies Greta baked and received: 12 (her own baked) + 6 (from her office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies in total.\n2. Subtract the brownies eaten during the party: 66 (total at start) - 18 (eaten at the party) = 48 brownies left over.\n\nSo, Greta has 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."

Add these variables to get the total number of brownies at the start.\n3. Subtract the number of brownies eaten at the party from the total number at the start.\n4. The result will be the number of brownies Greta has left over.\n\n```python\n# Assigning the number of brownies Greta baked and received to variables\nbrownies_baked = 12\nbrownies_office = 6\nbrownies_friends = 48\n\n# Adding the brownies together to get the total number at the start\ntotal_brownies = brownies_baked + brownies_office + brownies_friends\n\n# Defining the number of brownies eaten at the party\nbrownies_eaten = 18\n\n# Calculating the number of brownies left over\nbrownies_left = total_brownies - brownies_eaten\n\nprint(brownies_left)\n```"
