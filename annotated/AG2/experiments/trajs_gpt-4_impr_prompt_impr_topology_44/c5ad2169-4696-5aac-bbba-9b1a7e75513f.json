The coral pieces cost $2.00 each, and she bought three pieces, so $2.00 * 3 = $6.00.\n4. The fish cost $0.50 each, and she bought 20 fish, so $0.50 * 20 = $10.00.\n5. Finally, the fish food cost $2.00.\n\nNow, let's add all the costs together:\n\n$10.00 (fish tank) + $5.00 (stones) + $6.00 (coral pieces) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = Total spent.\n\nLet's calculate the total now."
