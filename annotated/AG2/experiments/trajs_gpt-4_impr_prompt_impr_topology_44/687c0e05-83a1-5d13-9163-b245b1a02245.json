Therefore, this implies that all unicorns in Scotland would be 6 / (2/3) = 9 unicorns. \n\n2. Secondly, it is stated that a third of the unicorns are in Scotland. So, the total amount of unicorns in the world would be 9 / (1/3) = 27 unicorns.\n\n3. Finally, to find out how many unicorns are left in the world outside Scotland, deduct the number of unicorns in Scotland from the total unicorns in the world. The calculation would be 27 - 9 = 18 unicorns. \n\nThus, there are 18 unicorns left in the world outside Scotland."

This can be done by dividing the number of unicorns in Scotland by 1/3 (since a third of them are in Scotland).\n4. Finally, calculate the number of unicorns left in the world (outside Scotland). This can be done by subtracting the number of unicorns in Scotland from the total number of unicorns in the world.\n\nLet's write this in code.\n\n```python\n# Number of female unicorns in Scotland\nnum_female_unicorns_scotland = 6\n\n# Total number of unicorns in Scotland\ntotal_unicorns_scotland = num_female_unicorns_scotland / (2/3)\n\n# Total number of unicorns in the world\ntotal_unicorns_world = total_unicorns_scotland / (1/3)\n\n# Number of unicorns left in the world (outside Scotland)\nunicorns_left = total_unicorns_world - total_unicorns_scotland\n\nprint(unicorns_left)\n```\nThis calculation would give the number of unicorns left in the world outside Scotland."
