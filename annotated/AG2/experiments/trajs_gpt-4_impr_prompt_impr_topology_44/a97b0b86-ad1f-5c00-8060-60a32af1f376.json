      "content": "To solve this problem, I would suggest the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples.\n2. Subtract this total cost from the total amount Marie paid. \n3. Divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza. This will give us the number of boxes of pizza that Marie ordered.\n\nSo, let's put these steps into action:\n\nStep 1: \n    The cost of the chicken meal is $12.\n    The cost of the 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3.50 = $17.50.\n    The cost of the 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.\n    So, the total cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples is $12 + $17.50 + $6 = $35.50.\n\nStep 2:\n    The total cost that Marie paid is $52.5.\n    So, the remaining amount after subtracting the total cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples is $52.5 - $35.50 = $17.\n\nStep 3:\n    The cost of a box of pizza is $8.50.\n    So, the number of pizza boxes that Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza. \n\nHence, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. \n\nNote: We are assuming here that Marie ordered whole boxes of pizza (not fractions of a box). That's why we consider the number of pizza boxes as an integer. In other words, the total amount Maria paid must be enough to pay for a complete number of boxes of pizza. "
