  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Calculate the weight of each kind of feed. They arrived at the following:\n     * Sugar cubes: 2 boxes×1 pound/box = 2 pounds\n     * Carrots: 4 bags ×12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds\n     * Hay: 42 bales ×75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds\n     * Oats: 20 sacks ×65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds\n2. Sum up all the weights to find the total weight:\n     * 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds\n3. Divide the total weight by 2 to represent the 2 trips it takes to transport all the feed. This gives the maximum weight the truck can carry in a single trip.\n     * 4500 pounds / 2 = 2250 pounds\n\nUpon verification, the approach is correctly implemented and yields the correct results. So, the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds of feed per trip."
