Hence, the area for each piece equals length x width = 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet. But Jim needs two such pieces, so the total area for the comforter is 2 x 80 square feet = 160 square feet. \n\nThe area of fabric for the duvet cover is also calculated as length x width = 9 feet x 11 feet = 99 square feet. \n\nAdding up all the areas, Jim needs 160 square feet (for the comforter) + 99 square feet (for the duvet cover) = 259 square feet of fabric in total."
