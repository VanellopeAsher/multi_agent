We know that there are 6 students playing tennis.\n2. Given that there are twice as many students playing volleyball as tennis, there must be 2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball.\n3. We are also given that there are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer, but no total number for the soccer players. For lack of specific information, we assume that 22 represents the total number of students playing soccer.\n4. Adding all these together gives the total number of students: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 22 (soccer)."
