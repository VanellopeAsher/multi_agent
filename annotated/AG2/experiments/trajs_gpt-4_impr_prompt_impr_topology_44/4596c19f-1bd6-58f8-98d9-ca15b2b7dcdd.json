Calculate the total cost for one jar: This requires finding the total cost of all the ingredients for one jar, which includes the passion fruit, jackfruit, and special honey. We do this by multiplying the weight needed for each ingredient by its respective price per pound and summing these up.\n\n2. Subtract the cost of a single jar from the selling price to find the profit of one jar: To find how much profit is made from selling one jar, we subtract the total cost found in step 1 from the selling price of a single jar.\n\n3. Multiply the profit of one jar by the number of jars sold to find the total profit: Finally, we calculate the total profit from selling 10 jars by multiplying the profit from one jar (found in step 2) by the number of jars sold (which is 10 in this case). \n\nLet's proceed with these steps."

We'll use it to calculate the profit following the steps suggested by Agent Problem Solver.\n\nLet's start by defining the weights and price-per-pound for each ingredient.
