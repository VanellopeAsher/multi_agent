Compute the total weekly expense on bleach by multiplying the number of clients by the number of bottles of bleach required for each client and by the cost of each bottle of bleach. \n\n3. Subtract the expenses on bleach and the profit from the total income. This should give us the total weekly cost for cloths.\n\n4.
