      "content": "First, we need to calculate the number of yellow ties John bought and how much he spent on green ties. Then we'll calculate how many red ties he bought and how much he spent on them. Lastly, we sum up all the expenditures to find out the total amount spent.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. To find out how many yellow ties John bought, we divide the total expenditure on yellow ties by the cost of a single yellow tie: $300 / $30 = 10 yellow ties.\n2. We know that green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties. So, the cost of each green tie is  $30 + (70/100 * $30) = $51. John bought the same amount of green ties as he did yellow, so he spent 10 * $51 = $510 on green ties. \n3. John also bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since the number of blue ties equals the number of yellow ties, John has 10 blue ties. Therefore, he must have 2 * 10 = 20 red ties. \n4. If red ties have the same cost as yellow ties, the total value spent on red ties is $30 * 20 = $600.\n5. To determine how much John spent on ties overall, we add together the amounts spent on each color: $300 (Yellow) + $510 (Green) + $600 (Red) = $1410.\n\nSo, John spent $1410 on ties."
