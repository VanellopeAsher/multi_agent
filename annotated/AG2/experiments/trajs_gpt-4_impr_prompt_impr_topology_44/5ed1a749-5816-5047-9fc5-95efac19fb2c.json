Simplified, this is 4.25X pieces. \n\nAgent Code Executor provided a Python code example, assuming the first set has 100 pieces. In this specific context, the total number of pieces picked up would be 425. This number can be adjusted based on the exact number of pieces in the first Lego set, as needed. Overall, we can conclude that Johnny picks up 4.25 times the amount of Lego pieces that are in the first box."

As shown in the Python code run by Agent Code Executor, if the first box contained 100 pieces, then Johnny picks up 425 pieces in total. However, keep in mind that the actual numerical total can be different depending on the number of pieces in the first box.

Indeed, if we assume for example that there were 100 pieces in the first box, Johnny would pick up 425 pieces in total.
