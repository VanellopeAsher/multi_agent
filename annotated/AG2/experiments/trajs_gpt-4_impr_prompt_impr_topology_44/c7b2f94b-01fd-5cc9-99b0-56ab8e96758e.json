No apples from the average trees.\n\nTogether, they gather a total of 500 apples.\n\nWe need to find out how many apples Joanne's sister collected from the shortest trees, denoted by x. \n\nLet's formulate an equation considering that the total combined number of apples they both collected is 500:\n\nJoanne's apples + Joanne's sister's apples = Total apples\n(30 + 15 + 350) + (60 + x) = 500\nThis simplifies to:\n395 + x = 500\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the value of x. Once we have this value, we can then determine how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees by dividing her count (x) by Joanne's count (which is 15)."

Let's solve it.\n\n1. Figure out how many apples Joanne Gathered: From the tallest trees Joanne got 30 apples, from the shortest trees she got half of the tallest (30/2)= 15 apples and from the average trees she got 350 apples. In total Joanne gathered (30+15+350) = 395 apples. \n\n2. Figure out how many apples Joanne's sister gathered: According to the question, Joanne's sister gathered twice as many as Joanne did from the tallest trees which is (2 * 30) = 60 apples. Additionally, she gathered some apples from the shortest trees but we don't know how many. So, let's assume that she gathered 'x' apples from the shortest trees.\nIn total, Joanne's sister gathered = (60 + x) apples.\n\n3. Now, We know that together Joanne and her sister gathered a total of 500 apples. Hence, (joanne's apples + Joanne's sister's apples) = 500 => (395 + 60 + x) = 500 => x = 45 apples.\n\n4. We need to find the number of times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees => x / Joanne's shortest trees apples => 45/15 = 3 times. \n\nTherefore, Joanne's sister gathered 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees."
