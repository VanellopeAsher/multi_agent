Let's denote the father's age by F and the brother's age by B. \n2. According to the problem, when Emil is 26 years old, his father's age will be 26 * 2 = 52 years old, and his brother's age will be 26 / 2 = 13 years old.\n3. To calculate their current ages, keep in mind that the time when Emil is 26 is 5 years in the future from now. Subtract 5 years from both the father's and brother's future ages.\n   - Father's current age is 52 - 5 = 47 years old\n   - Brother's current age is 13 - 5 = 8 years old\n4. Finally, find the sum of the father's and brother's current ages: 47 (father's age) + 8 (brother's age) = 55\n\nSo, the sum of the current ages of Emil's father and brother is 55."
