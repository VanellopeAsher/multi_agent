      "content": "Sure, let's break down the problem:\n\n1. John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which means he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming.\n\n2. Watching 3 different shows each 2 hours long would account for 3*2 = 6 hours.\n\n3. Therefore, so far, John has spent 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours total.\n\n4. We know from the problem that this 15 hours is 30% of his total time. If we denote the total time as T, then we have the equation 0.30*T = 15.\n\n5. Solving for T gives T = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours. \n\n6. Finally, to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, we subtract the time he spent doing the other activities from the total time. That is, 50 (total) - 15 (other activities) = 35 hours sightseeing. \n\nSo John spent 35 hours sightseeing. \n\nWould you like to confirm, Agent Code Executor?"
