A normal sudoku puzzle takes 30 minutes to complete. Thus, he drinks 1 bottle of water (since 30 minutes = half an hour). \n2.  An extreme sudoku takes three times as long as a normal one, meaning it takes 90 minutes (30 * 3). As John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, during this period he drinks 3 bottles of water. \n\nThus, in total, while completing both a normal and an extreme sudoku, John drinks 1 + 3 = 4 bottles of water. This is the proposed solution."

The conclusion was that John drinks 4 bottles of water while completing both a normal and an extreme sudoku. \n\nAgent Code Executor confirmed this solution by implementing and running a Python script. The code correctly captured the time in minutes for both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles, the rate at which John drinks water, and calculated the total amount of water consumed across both types of puzzles. The script outputted the same result as Agent Problem Solver, further confirming its correctness.\n\nUpon careful examination of the proposed solutions and the given problem, I can confirm that both agents have provided accurate and valid solutions. Therefore, I confidently conclude that John drinks a total of 4 bottles of water while completing both a normal and an extreme sudoku.\n\nFinal Solution: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{4}**."
