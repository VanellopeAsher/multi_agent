As there are 3 sisters, the total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48 years.\n\n2. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, so his age is 3/5 * 20 = 12 years.\n\n3. The other brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so he is 2 * 12 = 24 years.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total age by adding up the ages of all the siblings: 48 (for the sisters) + 12 (for the younger brother) + 24 (for the older brother) = 84 years. So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years.\n"
