A dilution reduces the concentration of a solute in solution by adding more solvent (in this case, saline with 0% salt). Therefore, we can solve this problem by setting up an equation that represents the conservation of mass. \n\nThe initial amount of salt is equal to the final amount of salt, so the volume of the initial solution * initial concentration = volume of the final solution * final concentration.\n\nWe know that the pharmacist starts with a 30 ml saline solution at 10% salt concentration. We are looking for the final volume of the solution once diluted to a 5% salt concentration.\n\n1. We can start by calculating the initial amount of salt: 30 ml * 10% = 3 ml.\n2. Next, we can form and solve our equation. We know the final concentration and the amount of salt, so we can solve for the final volume: 3 ml / 5% = 60 ml.\n3. Since we know that the final volume should be 60 ml and we originally had 30 ml, the pharmacist needs to add: 60 - 30 = 30 ml of pure saline.\n\nThis can be implemented in Python as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define initial volume and concentration\ninitial_solution_volume = 30\ninitial_salt_concentration = 10 / 100\n\n# Calculate initial amount of salt\ninitial_salt_amount = initial_solution_volume * initial_salt_concentration\n\n# Define final salt concentration\nfinal_salt_concentration = 5 / 100\n\n# Calculate final volume\nfinal_solution_volume = initial_salt_amount / final_salt_concentration\n\n# Calculate the volume of saline to add\nvolume_to_add = final_solution_volume - initial_solution_volume\n```\n\nThe volume_to_add variable will contain the answer for how much pure saline the pharmacist needs to add."
