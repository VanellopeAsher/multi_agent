Because it's a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal, meaning both long sides measure 20 feet and both short sides measure 15 feet.\n3. To find the total length of the fence, we should add up the lengths of all 4 sides. This is calculating the perimeter.\n4. Therefore, the total length of the fence is (20 feet x 2 sides) + (15 feet x 2 sides).\n\nAfter calculating the above, we will get the total length of crepe paper James needs to buy for his fence."
