      "content": "Sure, to solve the problem, we need to add up the total time Frankie has spent watching TV across each day of the week from Monday to Friday. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched an hour-long episode every night. Since there are 2 days, we multiply the number of daily consumed hours (1) by the number of days (2):\n   2 days * 1 hour = 2 hours.\n2. On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. We need to convert the total minutes into hours:\n   30 minutes * 3 / 60 minutes = 1.5 hours.\n3. On Thursday, he watched an hour-long episode and a 30-minute show. We need to convert the 30 minutes into hours:\n   1 hour + 30 minutes / 60 minutes = 1.5 hours.\n4. On Friday, he watched two one-hour shows. The total duration is:\n   2 shows * 1 hour = 2 hours. \n5. Now, we get the total TV watching hours by adding up all the calculated time:\n   2 hours on Mon & Tues + 1.5 hours on Wed + 1.5 hours on Thu + 2 hours on Fri = 7 hours. \n\nTherefore, Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours from Monday to Friday."
