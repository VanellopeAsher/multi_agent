Thus, the amount used in one dose equals to x + 3x = 4x.\n\nGiven that the total amount of medicine used in 8 doses is 448 mL, we can establish the equation: 8 * 4x = 448.\n\nThe solution to this equation gives us the amount of the first medicine (x) Saanvi uses each time. Here are the steps to solve it:\n\nStep 1: Simplify the equation 8 * 4x = 448 to 32x = 448.\nStep 2: Solve for x in the equation 32x = 448 by dividing each side by 32. \n\nThe resulting calculation will give us the value of x.
