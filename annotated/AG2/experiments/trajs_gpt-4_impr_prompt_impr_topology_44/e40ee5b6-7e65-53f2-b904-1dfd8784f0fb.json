Determine the price of a half-gallon jar: Given that a one-gallon jar is priced $2 higher than a half-gallon jar, we can ascertain the price of the half-gallon jar by subtracting 2 from the price of the one-gallon jar.\n\n2. Compute the total sum spent on one-gallon jars: Multiply the quantity of one-gallon jars by their price. \n\n3. Compute the total sum spent on half-gallon jars: Multiply the quantity of half-gallon jars by their price. \n\n4. Combine the total sums of steps 2 and 3: This will give you the total sum that Cecelia expended on purchasing all the jars. \n\nWithout the actual execution of these steps, the pictorial representation may look like:\n\n   Price of one gallon = $5\n   Price of half gallon = Price of one gallon - $2 \n   Total on one gallon = Price of one gallon * Quantity of one gallon  \n   Total on half gallon = Price of half gallon * Quantity of half gallon   \n   Total sum = Total on one gallon + Total on half gallon\n"
