Becca has 0.12 hundred more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3X + 0.12.\n4. We know that the total number of cards is 3.41 hundred. So, PJ's cards (X) + Smendrick's cards (3X) + Becca's cards (3X + 0.12) should be equal to 3.41 hundred.\nSo, we have the following equation: X + 3X + 3X + 0.12 = 3.41.\n\nLet's solve this equation to find the number of cards Becca has. To make it easier, we can multiply the whole equation by 100 so that we will find the answer in the number of cards rather than hundreds of cards. The equation will then be: 100X + 300X + 300X + 12 = 341."
