If the number of packs is not provided, we could assume it as 'x'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of balloons. The packs of balloons have 30 balloons per pack. So if 'x' packs were used, there would be a total of 30*x balloons.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the remaining balloons from the total. From the problem, we know that 12 balloons were left. So the number of thrown balloons would be 30*x - 12.\n\nThis approach is assuming that we have information about the number of packs of balloons used. However, without knowing the exact number of packs used (part of the given problem), the specific answer cannot be determined."

In case we don't have this information, we can assume the number of packs is a variable 'x'. Thus, the number of thrown balloons would be represented by the formula 30*x - 12. \n\nThe Python function provided by Agent Code Executor could also be helpful once the number of packs is known. It would calculate the number of thrown balloons by multiplying the number of packs by 30 (balloons per pack) and then subtracting the 12 balloons left. But in the absence of the exact number of packs used, we can't provide a specific number of thrown balloons.\n\nLet's hope Jolene has great fun in the summer and keeps track of the number of balloon packs for her next water balloon fight!"

Until this data is provided, the best course of action consists of utilizing the formula (balloons per pack * number of packs - remaining balloons), which translates in Python to (30*x - 12).\n\nAs soon as the missing data becomes available, the proposed Python function can be used to determine the number of thrown balloons efficiently. However, without the exact number of packs, an attempt to execute the function would be futile and akin to chasing balloons in the wind. \n\nI do concur that we all hope Jolene has an enjoyable and memorable summer water balloon fight.

It's commendable that everyone provided the best possible solutions under given circumstances. Hopefully, we'll have more complete data in future assignments. \n\nLet's not lose sight of the most exciting aspect of this problem - summer is here, and Jolene's water balloon fight sounds very refreshing indeed!"
