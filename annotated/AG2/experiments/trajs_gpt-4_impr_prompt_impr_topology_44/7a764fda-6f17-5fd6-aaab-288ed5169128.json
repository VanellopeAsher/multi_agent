To get the new price we need to add 80% of the original price (i.e., $4000) to the original price.\n\n2. Calculate the January price: we know that in January, the price decreased by 50%. To get the new price we need to subtract 50% of the December price from the December price. This will give us the final price after discount."

The toy, originally priced at $4000, increased in price by 80% in December, making it $7200 ($4000 + $4000*0.80). In January, the price decreased by 50%, so the final price of the toy is $3600 ($7200 - $7200*0.50). The Python code proposed by Agent Code Executor calculates these steps correctly.
