Calculate the total amount the parents are willing to pay for all the classes. Multiply the cost per class by the total number of classes ($20 x 12 = $240).\n3. Subtract the actual total cost of the classes from the total amount the parents are willing to pay ($240 - $80 = $160). This is the amount Manny's parents are willing to lose if he misses classes. \n4. To find out how many classes Manny can miss, divide the total amount Manny's parents are willing to lose by the cost per class ($160 รท $20 = 8). \n\nManny can miss 8 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again."
