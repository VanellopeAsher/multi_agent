Calculate the cost for filling one hanging basket:\n   - Each hanging basket contains 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines.\n   - Therefore, the cost for filling one hanging basket equals the sum of the cost of the petunias and the cost of the sweet potato vines.\n   - The cost for the 30 petunias is $3.00/petunia * 30 petunias = $90.00\n   - The cost for the 20 sweet potato vines is $2.50/vine * 20 vines = $50.00\n   - Adding these two amounts, we find that the total cost for filling one hanging basket is $90.00 + $50.00 = $140.00\n\n2. Now we can calculate the cost for filling all 50 hanging baskets:\n    - Since each hanging basket costs $140.00 to fill, the cost for filling 50 baskets is $140.00/basket * 50 baskets = $7000.00\n\nSo, Katherine will spend $7000.00 to fill all 50 hanging baskets."
