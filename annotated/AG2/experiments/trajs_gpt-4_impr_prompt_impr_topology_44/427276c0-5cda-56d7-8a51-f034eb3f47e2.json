Since there are three women wearing 4.5-inch heels and three wearing 2.5-inch heels, the total height equals `(3 * 4.5) + (3 * 2.5)`.\n\n2. Then, you divide this sum by the total number of the women, which is 6. \n\nThe result of the above calculation will give the average height of the heels at the party. \n\nIn every step, be sure that you correctly multiply the number of women by the height of their heels and accurately perform the division. The division is the last step, and any error there would have a direct impact on the final result. This is how I ensure the computational part doesn't lead to any error. For the logical part, since the problem is straightforward, no other calculation model would make sense other than averaging. Therefore, the possibility of logical error seems to be minimal in this case."
