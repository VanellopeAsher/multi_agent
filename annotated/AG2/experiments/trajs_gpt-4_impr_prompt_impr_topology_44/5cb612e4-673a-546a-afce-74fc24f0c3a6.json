Here's my proposed solution. \n\nLet's denote the number of bags the trader sold as X.\n\n- The cost of each bag was $20, so the total cost was $20*X\n- The cost of transportation for each bag was $2, so the total cost of transportation was $2*X\n- The selling price for each bag was $30, so the total income from selling the bags was $30*X\n- The profit is the total income minus the total expenses. In other words, $30*X - $20*X - $2*X = $400\n\nBy solving this equation, we will get the value of X, which represents the number of bags sold."
