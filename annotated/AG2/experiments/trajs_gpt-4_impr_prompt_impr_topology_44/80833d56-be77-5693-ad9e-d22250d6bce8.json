He runs half as much the other two days, so 10 hours รท 2 = 5 hours each of the other two days.\n3. He runs 2 days for 5 hours each, so 2 days ร 5 hours/day = 10 hours for the other two days.\n4. Adding the hours for all the days, we get 10 hours (first day) + 10 hours (other two days) = 20 total hours in a week.\n\nJohn runs 100 miles in these 20 hours, so his speed is calculated as:\n\nSpeed = Distance รท Time\n\nThus, Speed = 100 miles รท 20 hours = 5 miles per hour."

So, he runs 10/2 = 5 hours on each of the other two days.\n3. The total time he spends running in a week is then 10 (first day) + 5 (second day) + 5 (third day) = 20 hours.\n4. We know that distance = speed * time. Here, we are given the distance (100 miles) and time (20 hours), so we can solve for speed.\n5. We can find the speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. This gives us 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles per hour.\n\nNow let's implement this using Python."
