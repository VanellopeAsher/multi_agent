For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.

      "content": "Here's the step-by-step plan to solve this problem algebraically:\n\n1. Define the problem's variables: \n    - Let Friday's number of car tyre repairs be C2.\n2. Set up the equation: \n    - According to the problem, the mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The Thursday earnings were $60*6 + $40*4. The Friday earnings were $40*C2. This gives us the equation: $60*6 + $40*4 = $40*C2 + 40.\n3. Rearrange the equation and solve for C2: \n    - Subtract 40 from both sides to get $60*6 + $40*4 - 40 = $40*C2. \n    - Therefore, the solution will be C2 = ($60*6 + $40*4 - 40) / $40. \n\nThis solution will provide the number of car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday."
