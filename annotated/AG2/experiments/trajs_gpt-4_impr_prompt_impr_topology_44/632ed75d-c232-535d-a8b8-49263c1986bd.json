We know that the second aircraft's 44 flights represent one-half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. To get the total number of flights made by the first aircraft, we multiply 44 by 2, which equals 88.\n\n2. We know that the first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights. But we're not interested in the flights to Greece right now.\n\n3. The remaining one-fourth of the total flights by the first aircraft are divided evenly between France and Germany. To calculate the flights going to France, we divide the total flights (88) by 4 (which represents the one-fourth portion), which would give us the total number of flights that are divided equally between France and Germany.\n\n4. Finally, to get the number of flights going to France, we divide again by 2 (since the flights are split evenly). \n\nLet's compute these calculations."

Halved the 22 to get the flights going to France = 11.\n\nThe computed solution is consistent with the problem statement as it adheres to the rule that half of the flights of the first plane equal to the total flights of the second plane (44*2 = 88), that three-fourths of the first plane's flights go to Greece (88*3/4 = 66), and the remaining one-fourth is evenly split between France and Germany (88/4 = 22, 22/2 = 11). \n\nTherefore, I can confirm that the first aircraft makes 11 flights daily to France.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{11}."
