According to Agent Problem Solver, Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards each. That makes 6*25=150 basketball cards which is correct.\n   \n2. Then Miss Maria has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards each. That makes 5*40=200 baseball cards. This is correct.\n   \n3. Adding the total basketball and baseball cards, Miss Maria has 150+200=350 cards in total, which is correct.\n   \n4. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards and gives the rest to her students, which means she gives out 350-50=300 cards to her students. This is correct.\n   \n5. If each student got 10 cards, the number of students can be calculated as 300/10=30. This is correct.\n   \nThe solution proposed by the Agent Code Executor is also correct, returning a result of 30 students.\n\nFINAL SOLUTION: Miss Maria has **30** students.\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{30}**"
