      "content": "Sure. Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches each week:**  \n    Judy teaches 5 classes each day from Monday to Friday. So, that's 5 classes * 5 days = 25 classes. \n    On Saturdays, she teaches 8 classes. This totalizes to 25 classes during weekdays + 8 classes on Saturday = 33 classes per week. \n    Remember, though she does a 5-minute warm-up session for each class, she doesn't charge for this, and therefore, it would not affect her earnings.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of students Judy teaches each week:**  \n    Each class has 15 students, and she teaches 33 classes per week. So, the number of students she teaches every week is 15 students/class * 33 classes/week = 495 students/week.\n\n3. **Calculate how much money Judy makes each week:**  \n    Judy charges $15 per student per class. Therefore, every week, she would make $15/student/class * 495 students/week = $7425/week.\n\nSo, Judy makes $7425 in one week."
