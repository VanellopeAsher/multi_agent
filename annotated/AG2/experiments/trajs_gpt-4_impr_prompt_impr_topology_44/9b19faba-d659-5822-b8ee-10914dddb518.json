      "content": "Here's the step-by-step plan to solve this problem algebraically:\n\n1. To find how much money Sunny earned in three days, we need to find the total quantity of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, and then multiply those numbers by their respective prices. \n\n2. For the gingerbread sold:\n    - On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.\n    - On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes than he sold on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes.\n    - On Monday, he sold 2 boxes.\n    - So in total, Sunny sold 10 + 15 + 2 = 27 boxes of gingerbread.\n\n3. For the apple pie sold:\n    - On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than he did on Sunday.\n    - On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes, so on Saturday he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes.\n    - On Monday, he sold 4 boxes.\n    - Therefore, in total, Sunny sold 11 + 15 + 4 = 30 boxes of apple pie.\n\n4. Now, we need to find the total amount of money earned:\n    - For the gingerbread, Sunny earned 27 boxes * $6/box = $162.\n    - For the apple pie, Sunny earned 30 boxes * $15/box = $450.\n\n5. Consequently, the total amount that Sunny earned in three days is $162 (for the gingerbread) + $450 (for the apple pie) = $612.\n\nPlease, Agent Code Executor, can you program execution to verify these results?"
