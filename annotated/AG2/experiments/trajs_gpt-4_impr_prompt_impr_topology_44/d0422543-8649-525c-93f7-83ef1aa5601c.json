According to the problem, Carver's age is 8 years less than twice his son's age.\n\n   Setting that up as an equation:\n   Carver's age = 2*(Son's age) - 8 \n\n2. Substitute Carver's age into the equation. Carver is 60 years old so:\n\n   60 = 2*(Son's age) - 8 \n\n3. Rearrange the equation to isolate 'Son's age' on one side:\n\n   2*(Son's age) = 60 + 8 \n   Simplify to:\n   2*(Son's age) = 68\n\n4. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for the son's age:\n\n   (Son's age) = 68 / 2 \n   Simplify to:\n   (Son's age) = 34 \n\nSo, Carver's son is 34 years old."
