Given that she invited 12 families with 6 people each and 15 families with 4 people each, we need to multiply the number of families by the respective individuals in each family to get the total for each set of families, then add those totals together.\n\n2. We find out the total number of people who could not attend. We know 16 people were unable to come due to illness and a quarter of that number had prior engagements. Adding these two numbers gives us the total number of absentees.\n\n3. To find out the number of attendees at the party, we subtract the number of absentee individuals from the total number that were originally invited. \n\nLet's go through calculation!"
