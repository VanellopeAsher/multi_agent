Calculate the total from selling milkshakes. This is done by multiplying the price per milkshake ($5.50) by the quantity sold (6).\n\n    $5.50 * 6 = Total from milkshakes\n\n2. Do the same for the burger platters: multiply the price per burger platter ($11.5) by the quantity sold (9).\n\n    $11.5 * 9 = Total from burger platters\n\n3. For the sodas, since Terry only sold half of the 40 he had, we first calculate how many sodas were sold by dividing 40 by 2. Then, we multiply this result by the price per soda ($1.50).\n\n    (40/2) * $1.50 = Total from sodas\n\n4. Finally, we add up the totals from the milkshakes, the burger platters, and the sodas to get the total amount Terry made.\n\n    Total from milkshakes + Total from burger platters + Total from sodas = Total earnings\n\nLet's proceed to calculate the exact numbers."
