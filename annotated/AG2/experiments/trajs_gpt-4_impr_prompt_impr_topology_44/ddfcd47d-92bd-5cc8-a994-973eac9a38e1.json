      "content": "To solve the problem:\n\nStep 1: Find out how much Kassidy has.\nSince we know that Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $150, we can calculate how much Kassidy has as follows:\n    Kassidy = Aurelia * 2/3\n        => Kassidy = 150 * 2/3\n        => Kassidy = 100\n\nStep 2: Find out how much Rayna has.\nWe are told that Rayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy. We can calculate how much Rayna has as follows:\n    Rayna = Kassidy + 70\n        => Rayna = 100 + 70\n        => Rayna = 170\n\nStep 3: Find out the total amount of money they have collectively.\nWe can add up the amounts of money each person has to find the total amount of money collectively.\n    Total amount = Aurelia + Kassidy + Rayna\n        => Total amount = 150 + 100 + 170\n        => Total amount = 420\n\nStep 4: Find out how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally.\nThe shared amount each person would receive is found by dividing the total amount by the number of people. Since we have 3 people (Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna), we can find the equally shared amount as follows:\n    Shared amount = Total amount / number of people\n       => Shared amount = 420 / 3\n       => Shared amount = 140\n\nTherefore, each person would have $140 if they shared their money equally."
