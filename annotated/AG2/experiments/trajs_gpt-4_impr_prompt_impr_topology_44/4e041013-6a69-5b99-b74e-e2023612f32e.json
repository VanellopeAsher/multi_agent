The Python code has succinctly solved the problem by dividing the total number of each color tulip by the number that can be planted per row, resulting in six rows of red tulips (as 36 divided by 6 is six) and three rows of blue tulips (since 24 divided by 8 is three). When these numbers are added together, we get a total of nine rows."

The Python code correctly calculated the total number of rows by dividing the total number of each type of tulip by the number of that type that can be planted per row (6 for red and 8 for blue). By adding these two totals together, we can see that Jackson will be planting a total of 9 rows in his garden. This solution is clean and straightforward."

They both proposed essentially the same solution: to divide the total number of each color of tulip by the number of tulips in one row of each color, and summing the results. The output of the Python code has confirmed their solutions. Even by manually checking the calculations, we could deduce that for the 36 red tulips we will need 6 rows (since 36/6 equals 6) and for the 24 blue tulips we will need 3 rows (since 24/8 equals 3). Adding these up gives us 6+3=9. So, the total number of rows Jackson will have in his garden is 9.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{9}."
