Calculate the amount of time it took James to swim the initial distance by dividing the initial distance by James's swimming speed.\n3. Calculate the rest time by dividing the initial swimming time by 2.\n4. Calculate the remaining distance to be swam: 30 miles - the initial distance swam.\n5. Calculate the time it took James to swim the remaining distance by doubling the time it would normally take (Because James is swimming at half his usual speed).\n6.

Initially, they calculated the time for swimming 70% of the distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour, denoted as time_initial, followed by the rest_time calculation. These calculations seem correct given that resting time is half of the initial swimming time.\n\n2. They then calculated the remaining distance and time, with James swimming at half his usual speed.\n\n3. The final solution was obtained by adding time_initial, rest_time, and time_final, equating to 16.5 hours. The units are consistent and correct.\n\nGiven that the calculations are essentially correct and all the solution steps make sense within the context of the problem, I conclude they have indeed found the final solution. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{16.5}."
