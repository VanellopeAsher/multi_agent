So, after the second week, the height was 2*3 = 6 inches.\nStep 3: In the third week, the height increased by some unknown value which made the total height as 10 inches.\nStep 4: We need to find out how much the height increased in the third week. We can subtract the height after the second week from the total height after the third week. The calculation will be 10 (the total height after the third week) - 6 (the height after the second week) = ???\n\nThe calculated value will be the growth in the third week. \n\nSo let's calculate."
