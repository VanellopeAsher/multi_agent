      "content": "Let's break the problem down step by step.\n\n1. We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. If the small ones cost $40, then the large ones cost $120 (3 * $40).\n\n2. The problem also states that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's denote the amount of small stuffed animals as 2x and large ones as x.\n\n3. The total amount made from the small stuffed animals can be represented as 2x * $40 and the total amount made from the large ones can be represented as x * $120.\n\n4. According to the problem, Teresa earned $1200 from the sales. To find how many small stuffed animals she sold, we need to solve the following equation:\n   2x * $40 + x * $120 = $1200\n\n5. After finding the value of x, we can find the number of small stuffed animals she sold by simply multiplying the value of x by 2."

      "content": "Let's now translate this plan into code and calculate the number of small stuffed animals.\n\n1. First, let's define the price per small and large stuffed animal.\n2. We'll establish a variable, `x`, that represents the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n3. We know that the combined sales from small and large stuffed animals equal $1200.\n4. Given the cost of each large and small stuffed animal, we can write an equation to solve for `x`.\n5. After finding the value of `x`, the number of small stuffed animals sold will be `2x`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python. \n\nWe'll use sympy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, to solve the equation. Note that as the task doesn't specify, we'll assume that the number of stuffed animals sold can only be an integer. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# define the variable we are going to solve for\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n# create equation\nequation = sp.Eq((40 * 2*x + 120 * x), 1200)\n\n# solve for x\nsolutions = sp.solve(equation, x)\nsolutions = [int(sol) for sol in solutions if sol.is_integer]\n\nif not solutions:\n    print(\"No integer solution found\")\nelse:\n    # calculate the number of small stuffed animals (2x)\n    small_animals = 2 * solutions[0]\n    print(small_animals)\n```\n\nAgent Code Executor, I suggest you run this code to obtain the solution for the problem."

Ensuring that we have received solutions from both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver:\n\n1. **Agent Code Executor:** The agent has successfully run the proposed code, favoring an integer solution, and obtained the result: 12 small stuffed animals were sold.\n\n2. **Agent Problem Solver:** The agent proposed a systematic solution, built an equation representing the problem, and suggested a method to find the number of small stuffed animals. The solution seems in line with the given constraints.\n\nGiven both agents agree that 12 small stuffed animals were sold, and no values have been assumed without explicit mention in the problem, I conclude that the correct solution is indeed 12. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}**."
