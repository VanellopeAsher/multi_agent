Next, segregate the items into two categories: food items and non-food items\n3. Add up the cost of all food items\n4. Compute the cost of non-food items including tax. Here, remember that the tax rate is 10%\n5. Finally, sum the total cost of food items and non-food items including tax to get the total cost. \n\nNow, let's move onto the cost computation:\n\n1. The food items John purchased are: milk, eggs, cookies, and a bottle of water. The cost for each of these items is $2, $3, $2, and $1 respectively. So, the cost of food items is $2+$3+$2+$1 = $8.\n2. The non-food items purchased by John are: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The cost for each of these items is $3, $3, and $4 respectively. So, the cost for non-food items before tax is $3+$3+$4 = $10.\n3. The tax on non-food items is 10%. Therefore, the total tax on non-food items would be 10% of $10 = $1.\n4. The total cost of non-food items including tax is the cost of non-food items before tax + tax = $10 + $1 = $11.\n5. Finally, the total cost of everything that John bought is the total cost of food items + the total cost of non-food items (including tax) = $8 + $11 = $19. \n\nSo, John spent a total of $19 on this shopping trip."

Calculate the tax on non-food items, which is 10% of the total cost of non-food items.\n5. Add the calculated tax to the total cost of non-food items.\n6. Lastly, add the total cost of food and non-food items to get the overall cost.\n\nHere's the Python code for this calculation:\n```python\n# Defining the cost of food items\nfood_items_cost = 2 + 3 + 2 + 1\n\n# Defining the cost of non-food items\nnon_food_items_cost = 3 + 3 + 4\n\n# Calculate the tax on non-food items (10% of the total cost of non-food items)\ntax_on_non_food_items = 0.10 * non_food_items_cost\n\n# Adding the tax to the total cost of non-food items\ntotal_non_food_items_cost = non_food_items_cost + tax_on_non_food_items\n\n# The total cost is the sum of the cost of food items and the total cost of non-food items\ntotal_cost = food_items_cost + total_non_food_items_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\nThe output of this code will be the total cost that John spent on his shopping trip."
