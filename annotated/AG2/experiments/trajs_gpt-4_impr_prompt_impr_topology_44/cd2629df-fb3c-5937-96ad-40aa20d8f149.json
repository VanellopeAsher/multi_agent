Determine how much Stephen still owes his sister after 11 months. This would be the initial loan of $300, minus what he has already paid. The amount owed is therefore $300 - $275 = $25.\n\n3. Determine the interest that Stephen has to pay. As Stephen promised to pay an additional 2%, we calculate 2% of $300. The interest is therefore $300 * 0.02 = $6.\n\n4. Determine the total amount Stephen has to pay on the 12th month. This is the unpaid amount from step 2 plus the interest from step 3. The total due is therefore $25 + $6 = $31.\n\nTherefore, Stephen must pay $31 to his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases."
