Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\nStep 1: Add the cost of the pots ($19) to the cost of the garden soil ($26).\n             This gives a total of $45.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the discount value ($7) from the total value obtained in step one ($45).\n             Subtracting 7 from 45 gives a total of $38. \n\nHence, the total amount of money the mother spent at the gardening store was $38."

First, I will define all the costs presented in the problem: the cost of the pots, the cost of the garden soil, and the value of the discount voucher.\n2. Then, I will calculate the total cost before the discount by adding the cost of the pots to the cost of the soil.\n3. Finally, I will calculate the final cost after the discount by subtracting the value of the discount from the total cost before the discount. Let's execute these steps:\n\n```python\n# the cost of the pots\ncost_pots = 19  \n\n# the cost of the garden soil\ncost_soil = 26  \n\n# the value of the discount voucher\ndiscount = 7  \n\n# the total cost before the discount\ntotal_before_discount = cost_pots + cost_soil  \n\n# the final cost after the discount\nfinal_cost = total_before_discount - discount  \nprint(final_cost)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total cost after the discount.
