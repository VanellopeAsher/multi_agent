      "content": "Jackson is planning to plant 36 red tulips, 24 blue tulips, and 30 yellow tulips. \n\nSince he plants 6 red tulips in a row, he will create 36 red tulips / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips. \n\nSimilarly, since he plants 8 blue tulips in a row, he will create 24 blue tulips / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n\nAccording to the provided information, every row of blue or red tulips will be followed by a row of yellow tulips. That means, all except one row of blue or red tulips will be followed by a row of yellow tulips. So, there will be (6-1) + (3-1) = 7 rows of yellow tulips in total.\n\nSince he plants 5 yellow tulips in a row, he will create 30 yellow tulips / 5 = 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n\nAs a result, he can plant 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 rows of flowers in total.\n\nIf he has enough yellow tulips for 7 rows but only plants 6 rows, that means he will have one row of red or blue flowers that is not followed by a row of yellow tulips.\n\nIt is also possible that he may have miscounted the number of yellow tulips rows he should be able to create.\n\nTherefore, we need to verify the number of rows of yellow tulips. If the 7 rows of yellow tulips are correct, he will have 6 rows red, 3 rows blue, and 7 rows yellow = 16 rows in total. If his calculation of 6 rows of yellow tulips is correct, then he will only have 15 rows of flowers in total."

This suggests that there will be an equal number of red/blue and yellow rows since the last row also gets a yellow tulips row. \n\nThus, following intensive evaluation, we conclude that Code Executor's proposal provides the correct solution.\n\nThe final solution is: Jackson will plant a total of 17 rows of flowers. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{17}**."
