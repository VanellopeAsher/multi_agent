We know Jake buys 20, so he's buying 10 pairs. The total price for T-shirts is 10 (pairs) * 1.5 (price for two shirts) * $80 (original price).\n2. For the shoes, they are 40% off. So Jake pays 60% of the original price. The price for the shoes would be 60% * $400.\n3. The total money Jake spends would be the total price for T-shirts plus the price for the shoes."
