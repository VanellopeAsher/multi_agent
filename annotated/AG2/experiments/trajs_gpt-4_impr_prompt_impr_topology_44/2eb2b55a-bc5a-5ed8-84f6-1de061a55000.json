Then they used 38 bandages. So, the total number of bandages left by the end of day 1 becomes: x + 50 - 38.\n2. On the second day, they used 10 bandages less than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, the total number of bandages by the end of day 2 becomes: (x + 50 - 38) - 28.\n3. On the third day, they added 50 * 2 = 100 from the two new packs, and used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25. So by the end of day 3, they had ((x + 50 - 38) - 28 + 100 - 25)=78 bandages left.\n\nNow we can set up the equation and solve for x (the number of bandages at the start of the first day):\n\n(x + 50 - 38) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78."

Finally, they used symbolic computation to solve the equation. However, the Python code executed by Agent Code Executor returns -19 as the number of bandages available at the start of the first day. This does not make sense in a real-world scenario as it is impossible to have negative bandages. This error in calculation may be attributed to a misinterpretation of the problem statement.

Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor interpreted this as 25 bandages being used, however, it is unclear how many bandages from the two packs the medical staff had at the beginning of the day.
