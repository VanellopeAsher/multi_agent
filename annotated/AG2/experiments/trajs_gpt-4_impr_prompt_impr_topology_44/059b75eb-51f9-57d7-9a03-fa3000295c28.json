On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow. So, we add this amount to the volume of water from the second day to find the total water volume on the third day. \n\nThis procedure will work for any initial water volume, rainfall amplification factor, and additional water volume. I'll await the equivalent code solution before I demonstrate the calculation with numerical values."
