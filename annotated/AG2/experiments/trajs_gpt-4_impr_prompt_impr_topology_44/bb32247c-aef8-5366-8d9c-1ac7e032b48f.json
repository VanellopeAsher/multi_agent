Unfortunately, we don't know the original value of x as this was not mentioned in the problem. But we can still express our solution in terms of x. \n   \n2. In the second week, the height of the beanstalk doubled. Therefore, at the end of the second week, the height is 2*x inches.\n    \n3. In the third week, the beanstalk grew an additional 4 inches. Therefore, at the end of the third week, the height is 2*x + 4 inches.\n\nSo, the height of the beanstalk after three weeks is 2*x + 4 inches. \n\nUnfortunately, since we don't know the height of the beanstalk after the first week (value of x), we can't provide a specific numerical value for the height after the third week."

After the first week, the height of the beanstalk is just its initial height: `initial_height`.\n2. The beanstalk doubled in height the next week. To find the height after the second week, we multiply its initial height by 2: `2 * initial_height`.\n3. The beanstalk grew by 4 more inches the next week. To find the final height, we add the growth of the third week to the height after the second week: `2 * initial_height + 4`.\n\nThus, the final height of the beanstalk is `2 * initial_height + 4`. However, we don't know the value of `initial_height` and as a result, we can't compute a specific numerical value for the final height. Therefore, the final height can be any value depending on the initial height of the beanstalk. \n\n```python\n# Variable to store the initial height of the beanstalk\ninitial_height = 'x'  # We don't know the initial height\n\n# Calculate the final height of the beanstalk\nfinal_height = f'2 * {initial_height} + 4'\n\nprint(final_height)\n```\n\nThe above code will output the expression for the height of the beanstalk after three weeks, which is `2 * x + 4`. Here `x` represents the initial height of the beanstalk. Agent Code Executor can do the coding and execute the Python code. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
