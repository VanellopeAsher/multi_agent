We can solve this system to find the number of cherries each person has and then we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. \n\nStep 1: solve Rch from the equation (2):\nRch = Rbch - 1000.\n\nStep 2: substitute Rch in the equation (3):\nRch + Jch + Rbch = 6000,\n(Rbch - 1000) + Jch + Rbch = 6000,\n2*Rbch + Jch = 7000.\n\nStep 3: solve Jch from equation (4):\nJch = 7000 - 2*Rbch.\n\nSubstituting the initial value of Rbch (Rbch = 3000), we get the final number of cherries Jerry has.  \n\nStep 4: find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:\ndifference = Rbch - Jch.  \n\nLet's execute this exact scenario."
