So, this answer is consistent with the initial problem statement. Now, I will check the code logic and the calculations.\n\nThe logic of the Python code seems to be solid. The sympy module was employed to represent the algebraic equations and perform the calculations, which is a good way to handle algebraic problems via Python.\n\nSo, the outputs of the Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor are consistent with the problem statement's solution.
