After finding this amount, we will then subtract the money she gave to her sisters and the charity.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Total money made from selling cookies = 80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80\n2. Total money made from selling cupcakes = 60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240\n3. Total money made = Total from cookies + Total from cupcakes = $80 + $240 = $320\n4. Money given to sisters = 2 sisters * $10/sister = $20\n5. Money left after giving to sisters = Total money - Money given to sisters = $320 - $20 = $300\n6. Money left after donating to charity = Money left after giving to sisters - Money donated = $300 - $15 = $285\n\nSo, Suzanne has $285 left from her earnings."
