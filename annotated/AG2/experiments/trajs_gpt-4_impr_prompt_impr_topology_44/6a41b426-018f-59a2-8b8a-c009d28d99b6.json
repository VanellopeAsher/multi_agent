While we know that John runs 60 miles a week, we don't know the timing of his runs, which would allow us to calculate his speed.\n\nSpeed can be calculated as distance divided by time (Speed = Distance / Time). To get the value for speed, we would require a measure of time, which isn't provided in this case.\n\nTherefore, we need either the total time John spends running each week, or his time spent running each day."
