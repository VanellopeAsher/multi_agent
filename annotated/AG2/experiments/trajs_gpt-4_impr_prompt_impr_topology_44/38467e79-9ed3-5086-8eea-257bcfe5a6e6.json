We know that two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer at home. Therefore, the remaining students (1 - 2/3 = 1/3) do not have a desktop computer at home.\n2. We also know that the number of students without desktop computers is 30.\n3. So, we can set up the equation: (1/3) * total number of students = 30. \n\nBy solving this equation for the total number of students, we will find the answer."

Because the number of students cannot be a fraction, we understand this to mean 90 students.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that there are 90 students at that grade level."
