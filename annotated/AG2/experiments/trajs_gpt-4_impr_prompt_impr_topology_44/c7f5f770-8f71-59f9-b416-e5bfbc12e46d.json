Billy took twice as many as Kyle. That means Billy took 2*6 = 12 fries. So Griffin had 24-12 = 12 fries left.\n4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, we don't know how many she gave yet.\n5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. Kyle took 6, so Colby took 6-3 = 3 fries. After this, Griffin had 12-3 = 9 fries.\n6. In the end, Griffin had 33 fries.\n\nSo to find out how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin, we need to subtract the number of fries Griffin had before she gave him some from the number Griffin had in the end. So the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin is 33-9 = 24 fries."
