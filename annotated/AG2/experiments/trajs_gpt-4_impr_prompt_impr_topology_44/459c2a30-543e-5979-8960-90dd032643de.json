Since there are 4 more blue squares than red, it means there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.\n\n3. It's given that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.\n\n4. From these, we can find the total number of red, blue, and green squares, which is 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) = 56.\n\n5. The total area of the quilted comforter is 68 square feet. This means the number of white squares is 68 (total) - 56 (red, blue, and green) = 12.\n\n6. To find out how much fewer the white squares are than the green squares, we subtract the number of white squares from the green squares, which is 24 (green) - 12 (white) = 12. \n\nSo, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares."
