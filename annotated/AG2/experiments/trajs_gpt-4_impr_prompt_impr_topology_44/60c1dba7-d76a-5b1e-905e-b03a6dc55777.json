I will double-check the solution with my process. My process involves the same steps but in a different order:\n\n1. Let's let the number of cards that PJ has be p.\n2. As per the problem, Smendrick has 4 times as many cards as PJ. That's 4p.\n3. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick. So, that's 4p + 15.\n4. We are told that the total number of cards is 447. Therefore, we can set up the equation: p + 4p + 4p +15 = 447.\n5. Solving this equation for p, we have 9p + 15 = 447; then, subtracting 15 from both sides, we get 9p = 432, and dividing both sides by 9 gives p = 48.\n6. Becca has 4p + 15 cards, so substitute p = 48 into this equation gives Becca = 4*48 + 15 = 207 cards."
