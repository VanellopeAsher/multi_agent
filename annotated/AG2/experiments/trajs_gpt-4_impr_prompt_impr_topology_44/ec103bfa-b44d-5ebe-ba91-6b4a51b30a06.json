Subtract this total from the total amount Marie paid to find out how much she spent on pizza.\n\n3. Divide this amount by the cost of a single box of pizza to find out the number of boxes she ordered.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. The chicken meal costs $120, 5 packs of milk cost $150 (5 packs * $30 each), and 40 apples cost $60 (40 apples * $1.50 each). This adds up to $330.\n\n2. Marie paid a total of $900, so subtracting the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples ($330) from this gives $570.\n\n3. Dividing this amount by the cost of a single box of pizza ($57) gives the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Therefore, the solution to this problem would be $570 / $57."
