Given 2.25 hours of work, we have 3 hours to be billed, as labor is charged in full hours.\n\nSolution steps:\n1. Calculate the total labor cost. For 3 hours, the labor cost = labor charge per hour * number of hours billed = $35 * 3.\n2. Calculate the total service fee. As given, the service fee = $40.\n3. Calculate the cost of the parts used.
