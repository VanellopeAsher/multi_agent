      "content": "To solve this problem, we can track the height differences between the children. \n\n1. The fourth child is 72 inches (or 6 feet) tall. \n\n2. Since the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, we can subtract those three inches from the fourth child's height to find the third child's height. \n\n3. The third child is five inches shorter than the second child, so we can add five inches to the third child's height to find the second child's height.\n\n4. Finally, the second child is two inches taller than the first child. We can subtract two inches from the second child's height to find the first child's height.\n\n5. As the result would be in inches, we divide by 12 to convert it into feet as the question asks for the height of the first child in feet.  \n\nThis method lets us determine the heights of the children in reverse order. Once we find the first child's height in inches, we convert that height to feet by dividing by 12. A foot has 12 inches, so this conversion is straightforward."
