The total price is the quantity purchased multiplied by the price per itemâ€”in this case, 10 gallons of gas purchased multiplied by $3.00 per gallon. \n\n2. Apply the cashback. The cashback is .20 per gallon, and 10 gallons were bought, so multiply .20 by 10 to find the total cashback.\n\n3. Subtract the cashback from the total price to find the new total. \n\n4. Apply the coupon. The coupon is a 10% discount, and you find 10% by multiplying by 0.10. \n\n5. Subtract the coupon discount from the total after cashback to find the final price. \n\nLet's proceed to execute these steps."

Then we applied the coupon discount to the $28.00 (10% of $28.00=$2.80), and subtracted that from the cost after discount, resulting in the final cost of $25.20. I hope this helped!

It followed the steps of calculating the total cost before any discounts, applying cash back, calculating the cost after cash back, applying the coupon discount and calculating the final cost, which all aligns with the original problem statement.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing both agents' proposed solutions, I am confident that the final solution is correct.
