      "content": "Here's my step-by-step solution:\n\n1. First, we need to figure out the cost of a single pack of bacon, which we can do by dividing the total cost by the total number of packs. In this case, it's $10.5/5 = $2.1.\n\n2. Knowing the cost of a pack of bacon, we can calculate the cost of a pack of chicken since it's said that it costs twice as much. So, it's 2 * $2.1 = $4.2.\n\n3. For 6 packets of chicken, the total cost is 6 * $4.2 = $25.2.\n\n4. The cost of the strawberries is straightforward to calculate because it's given directly in the problem: 3 packs * $4.5 = $13.5.\n\n5. We are told that an apple pack costs half as much as a pack of strawberries, so the cost of a pack of apples is $4.5/2 = $2.25.\n\n6. The total cost of the 7 packets of apples is 7 * $2.25 = $15.75.\n\n7. By adding up the costs of all the different items, we can find the total cost of the groceries: $10.5 (bacon) + $25.2 (chicken) + $13.5 (strawberries) +  $15.75 (apples) = $64.95.\n\n8. Subtracting the total cost of the groceries from Kelly’s budget, we can find out how much money she has left: $65 (budget) - $64.95 (groceries) = $0.05.\n\nSo, Kelly has $0.05 left in her budget."
