Calculate the combined age of the sisters: since they are all the same age (16 years old), and there are 10 of them, multiply 16 by 10 to get 160 years old.\n4. Add the total ages of the brothers and sisters to find the total age of all the siblings: 36 + 160 = 196 years old. \n\nSo, the total age of all the siblings is 196 years old."
