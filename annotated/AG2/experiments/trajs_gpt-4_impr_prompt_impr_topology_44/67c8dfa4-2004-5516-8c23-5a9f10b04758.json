Since she sold each painted bag for $8 and made a profit of $160, she would have sold $160/$8 = 20 bags.\n2. Each pack purchased by Tara contains 5 bags. To get the number of packs, we divide the total number of bags by the number of bags in each pack. So, she bought 20/5 = 4 packs. \n\nSo Tara bought 4 packs of 5 canvas bags."
