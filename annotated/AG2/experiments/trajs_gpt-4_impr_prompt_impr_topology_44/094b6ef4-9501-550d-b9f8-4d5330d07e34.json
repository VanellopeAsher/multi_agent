So, multiply 2 (the number of remoras) by 6 (the length of each remora).\n\n2. The combined length of the remoras represents 10% of the shark's body length. Therefore, the shark's length is the total length of the remoras divided by 10%.\n\nLet's put these steps in mathematical format:\n\n1. total_length_of_remoras = 2 * 6\n2. length_of_shark = total_length_of_remoras / 0.1\n\nOnce we have these calculations, we can get the shark's length."
