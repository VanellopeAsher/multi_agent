Therefore, the cost for a year increased to 3 * $25 = $75. So, for 3 years she spent 3 * $75 = $225.\n\nSumming up the costs for all the years, Pauline spent on all visits to the museum $300 + $225 = $525."

Therefore, for 10 years she spent 10 * 3 * 10 (years * visits per year * ticket price).\n   \n2. In the next 3 years, every visit cost was increased by 150%, which means each ticket cost now 10 (original price) + 10 * 150/100 (increased by 150%).
