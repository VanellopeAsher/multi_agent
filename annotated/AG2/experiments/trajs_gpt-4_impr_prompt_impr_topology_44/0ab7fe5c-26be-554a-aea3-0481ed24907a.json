This comes to 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips. \n   \n2. Next, we need to figure out how many rows of each color tulip Jackson can plant. He can plant 6 red tulips in a row, and he has 36 red tulips. Thus, he can plant 36/6 = 6 rows of red tulips.\n   \n3. He can plant 8 blue tulips in a row, and he has 24 blue tulips. Thus, he can plant 24/8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n   \n4. To find the total number of rows Jackson will plant, we simply add the number of rows of red tulips to the number of rows of blue tulips. In this case, 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of tulips. \n\nSo, Jackson will plant 9 rows of tulips."

He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, so he can plant 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n\n3. Finally, add up the rows of red and blue tulips to find the total number of rows he will plant: 6 + 3 = 9 rows.\n\nTherefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."

This is calculated by multiplying the provided 2.4 times by ten to find out that there are 24 blue tulips. \n\n3. Calculate the number of rows for red tulips by dividing the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips that can fit into a row. This is 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row equals 6 rows.\n\n4. Repeat step three for the blue tulips. This will yield 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row equals 3 rows. \n\n5. Add up the two results from step three and four. This is 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips which equals 9 rows. \n\nSo, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers."
