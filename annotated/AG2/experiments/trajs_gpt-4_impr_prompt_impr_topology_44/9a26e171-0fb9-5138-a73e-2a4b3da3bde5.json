Identify that 20 students represent those who only have desktops and represent one third of the total number of students who do not have either a desktop or laptop.\n   \n2. Calculate the total number of students who do not have either a desktop or laptop computer at home by multiplying 20 by 3, which gives 60 students.\n   \n3. Understand that these 60 students represent the one-fourth of students who do not have a desktop. This is because three-fourths of the students have desktops, implying that the remainder, one-fourth, do not have desktops.\n   \n4. Calculate the total number of students by multiplying the number of students who do not have a desktop, 60, by 4 (since they present one-fourth of total). The total would then be 60 * 4 = 240 students. \n\nSo, in total there are 240 students in that grade level."
