So, we multiply the total TVs sold by these fractions:\n\n- For smart TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/4.\n- For analog TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/8.\n- For projection TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/5.\n\nThen, we sum up these results to find the total number of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs sold.\nFinally, we subtract this total from 40 TVs to find the amount of OLED TVs sold."
