She got 3 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 64 crayons. So the total is 3 * 64.\n2. Determine the total number of crayon muffins Kate could make. Each muffin is made from 8 small pieces of crayons, so the total number of muffin crayons is the total number of crayon pieces divided by 8.\n3. Compute the price of each crayon muffin. The total cost she made was $36, and she sold all her crayon muffins. Thus, the price of each crayon muffin is the total cost divided by the total number of muffin crayons."
