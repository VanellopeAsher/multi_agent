This means they watch 4/2 = 2 movies on Sundays.\n3. This routine is followed every weekend.\n4. We need to find the total number of movies they can watch in a span of 4 weeks.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\nStep 1: Find the total number of movies watched in one weekend.\n- On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.\n- On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.\n- Therefore, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by the number of weekends in 4 weeks.\n- There are 4 weekends in 4 weeks.\n- Therefore, they watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies in 4 weeks."

Calculate the number of movies they watch every weekend:\nOn Saturdays, they watch 4 movies and on Sundays, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturdays, which is 2. Therefore, they watch 6 movies every weekend.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks:\nThere are 4 weekends in 4 weeks. Therefore, over 4 weeks, they watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.\n\nFinally, print the result."
