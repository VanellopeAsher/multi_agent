The cost of neutering is $150.\n2. There are 2 vaccines each costs $30, so the cost for vaccines = 2 * 30 = $60.\n3. The kitten broke 3 vases each costs $15, so the cost for the broken vases = 3 * 15 = $45.\n\nAfter you have calculated each cost, add them together to get the total cost: Total cost = cost of neutering + cost for vaccines + cost for broken vases.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost."
