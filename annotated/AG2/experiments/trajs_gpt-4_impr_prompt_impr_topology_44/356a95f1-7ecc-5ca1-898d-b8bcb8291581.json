Set up a relationship between Harry and Sam's shares of the fence: According to the problem statement, Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam. Thus, if we denote Sam's share as 's', then Harry's share will be 's + 80'.\n2. Express the total length of the fence as an equation: The total length of fence jointly owned by Sam and Harry is 200 feet. Therefore, adding Sam's and Harry's shares should equate to this total length. The equation expressing this relationship is 's + (s + 80) = 200'.\n3. Solve the equation: In order to find out Sam's share, we need to simplify and solve this equation."

For each spin from Orange, list all possible second spins:\n   For Orange -> Silver, the possible spins are Green and Orange.\n   For Orange -> Yellow, the possible spin is Green.\n3.
