      "content": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to find out the total area of the fabric used by summing up the areas covered by medium and large t-shirts. The area covered by medium t-shirts can be found by multiplying the number of medium t-shirts with the area each medium t-shirt covers (8 * 4 square feet = 32 square feet). Similarly, the area covered by large t-shirts is 6 * 6 square feet = 36 square feet.\n\n2. We then add the total area covered by medium t-shirts and large t-shirts, which gives us 32 + 36 = 68 square feet.\n\n3. We know that the total area of the quilt Octavia made is 101 square feet. Thus, the area covered by the small t-shirts is the difference between the total area of the quilt and the area covered by medium and large t-shirts. So, 101 - 68 = 33 square feet.\n\n4. Since each small t-shirt covers an area of 3 square feet, the number of small t-shirts used can be found by dividing the total area covered by small t-shirts by the area each small t-shirt covers. So, 33 / 3 = 11.\n\nHence, Octavia used 11 small t-shirts to make the quilt."
