Calculate the total cost on the first day: Take the number of apples (15) times the cost per apple ($15) to get $225, then subtract the $3 voucher value from this total. So the cost on the first day is $222.\n2. For the second day, first determine the total cost before the discount. This is the number of apples (15) times the cost per apple ($25), or $375. But there is a 15% discount, so multiply the total cost by 0.15 and subtract this from $375 to get the amount paid on the second day.\n3. Finally, subtract the cost on the first day from the cost on the second day to find the difference in price paid."
