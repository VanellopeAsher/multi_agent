Calculate the total cost for each type of item: \n   - The cost for croissants is 5 items * $3.50/item = $17.50.\n   - The cost for cinnamon rolls is 4 items * $2.50/item = $10.00.\n   - The cost for mini quiches is 3 items * $4.50/item = $13.50.\n   - The cost for muffins is 13 items * $1.50/item = $19.50.\n\n2. Sum the total cost for all items to get the subtotal before discount: $17.50 + $10.00 + $13.50 + $19.50 = $60.50.\n\n3. Apply the loyalty card discount to the subtotal: $60.50 * 10% = $6.05.\n\n4. Subtract the discount from the subtotal to get the final total: $60.50 - $6.05 = $54.45.\n\nSo, Marcus's total bill, after the loyalty card discount, is $54.45."
