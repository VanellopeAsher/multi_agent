Calculate the total cost for each type of expense: the spaying cost is $200; for vaccines, the cost is $20 x 3 (number of vaccines), but there's a 10% discount on this total; for the broken vases, the cost is $12 x 4 (number of vases).\n3. Subtract the discount from the vaccine cost: $60 x (10/100) = $6 discount, so the total for vaccines is $60 - $6 = $54.\n4. Add up all the expenses to get the total cost of the kitten so far: $200 (spaying) + $54 (vaccines after discount) + $48 (broken vases) = $302. \nSo, Leah has spent $302 on her new kitten so far."
