They suggest that if Amora and Lainey get 700 corn chips each, the total for them will be 2*700 = 1400 corn chips. Collins gets 150 more than the others, which is 700+150 = 850. The total amount of corn chips can be calculated by adding these amounts: 1400 (Amora and Lainey) + 850 (Collins) to get 2250 corn chips. This process is logical and accurate, and there are no assumed variables or missing information in the original problem statement. Therefore, the answer to the question \"How many corn chips were there altogether?\" is 2250.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{2250}**"
