Solve the equations:\n\n     We have c = 2d - 5 and c = 45, which means 2d - 5 = 45. Solving for d (daughter's age) gives d = 25.\n\n     Now we can use d in the third equation: d = 3s + 4, which now is 25 = 3s + 4. Solving for s (son's age) gives s = 7. \n\n Therefore, Carver's son is 7 years old. \n\nWe can discuss this result further if necessary."
