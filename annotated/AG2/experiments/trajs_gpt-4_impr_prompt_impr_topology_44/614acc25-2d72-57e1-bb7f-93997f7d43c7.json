      "content": "First, let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed on the first night by the letter 'C'. We know that on the first night, he also killed 10 wolves.\n\nOn the second night, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so he killed '3C' wolves. He also killed three fewer cougars than on the first night, so the amount of cougars he killed on the second night is 'C - 3'.\n\nAdding all these animals together is then '10 + C + 3C + (C - 3)'. Let's simplify this to observe the total number of animals. \n\nThis simplifies to '10 + 5C - 3'. We have not yet been told the number of cougars he killed on the first night, which is represented in our equation by 'C'. \n\nWithout this information, we cannot determine an exact answer for the total number of animals Rick killed. I would ask for further information. Based on the information provided, if more specifics about 'C' were given, the solution would be to simply plug that number into the equation I provided, calculate, and arrive at an answer. \n\nFor example, if 'C' were 5, the total number of animals Rick would have killed is 10 + 5(5) - 3 = 10 + 25 - 3 = 32 animals. \n\nHowever, without the specific value for 'C', we cannot proceed to give an exact number of animals."

The number of cougars killed on the first night is crucial to find the exact number of animals killed.\n\nIf we take into account that undefined 'C' represents the count of cougars killed on the first night, and make these assumptions:\n\n1. '3C' represents the number of wolves killed on the second night.\n2. 'C - 3' represents the number of cougars killed on the second night.\n\nWe will get this equation to find the total number of animals killed: '10 + C + 3C + (C - 3)' which simplifies to '5C + 7'. \n\nSadly, without a specific value for 'C', we cannot determine the exact answer to the question asked. Lacking that crucial piece of information halts us from providing a concrete result.\n\nIf we had the exact number for 'C', we could simply substitute it into our equation to find the exact number of animals Rick killed over the two days. For instance, if 'C' was equal to 5, the total number of animals killed would result to 32. \n\nThe pseudo code is provided below:\n\n```python\nC = # The number of cougars killed on the first night (undefined in the problem)\ntotal_killed = 10 + C + 3*C + (C - 3) # Represents the total number of animals killed\nprint(total_killed)\n```\n\nFrom the pseudo code, it's clear that without the value of 'C', we can't get `total_killed`."
