That means every gram of mushroom contains 4/150 grams of protein. \n2. So, 300 grams of mushrooms will have (300 * 4/150) grams of protein. \n3. To get the protein John gets in a week (assuming he eats the mushrooms every day), we multiply the daily protein intake by 7.\n\nLet's calculate each step."

First, we calculated the amount of protein in each gram of mushroom, which is 4 grams of protein / 150 grams of mushroom = 0.02666666666666667 grams of protein per gram of mushroom.\n2. Then, the daily protein intake was calculated, which is 0.02666666666666667 grams of protein per gram of mushroom * 300 grams of mushroom = 8 grams of protein.\n3. Finally, the weekly protein intake was calculated, which is 8 grams of protein per day * 7 days = 56 grams of protein.\n\nAll of these calculations are correct.
