This will give us the amount Mark needs to save.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days Mark needs to save**: As Mark earns $12.5 daily, divide the amount he needs to save (obtained from the previous step) by $12.5. This will yield the number of days Mark needs to work in order to save enough for the bike. \n\nIn case the result is a fraction of a day, Mark will need to work the entire following day as well, so round up this number to the nearest whole number. This reflects the reality that Mark can't work a fraction of a day to earn money. \n\nDocument these steps as you go along."
