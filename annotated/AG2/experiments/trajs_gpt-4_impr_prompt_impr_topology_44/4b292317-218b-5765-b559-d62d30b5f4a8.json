The first step Agent Problem Solver proposed was dividing Marty's total ribbon length by 40 to calculate the length of each of the 40 equal parts. This operation was also done by Agent Code Executor in the Python code provided. Then, each of these individual parts was divided by 50, yielding the length of each final cut.\n\nThe Python code executed by Agent Code Executor produced a result of 5.0. Agent Problem Solver came to the conclusion that the length of each final part is exactly 5.0 millimeters.\n\nThere are no conflicts between the respective solutions offered by the two agents.\n\nHence, the final length of each cut will be 5.0 millimeters.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5.0}**."
