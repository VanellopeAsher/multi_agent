The difference between Joey's new  score and Marcy's score would be: x - 235 points.\n\n```python\njoey_start_points = 214\nmarcy_start_points = 225\nmarcy_new_points = 10\n\n# New score for Marcy\nmarcy_total_points = marcy_start_points + marcy_new_points\n\n# Subtract Marcy's points from Joey's start points\n# Define x as Joey's score\nx = joey_start_points\njoey_winning_by = x - marcy_total_points\n```\n\nPlease keep in mind that Joey's score x is only his starting score, undefined additional points that Joey made need to be added for the final result.
