Figure out how much money was spent on dinner, by calculating 3/5 of the remaining money after giving his sister her share.\n4. Determine how much money is left after buying the dinner by subtracting the dinner cost from the remaining amount after giving his sister half. \n\nNotice: The problem doesn't ask about the money his sister gives to his mother, so we won't include it in calculation."
