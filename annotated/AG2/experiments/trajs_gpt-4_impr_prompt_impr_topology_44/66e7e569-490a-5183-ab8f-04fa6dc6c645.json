We need to find out how many hash browns 960 potatoes would make. This seems like a simple proportional relationship.\n\nStep 2: Identify the proportion - From the given information, we know that 1 potato makes 360/60 = 6 hash browns.\n\nStep 3: Apply the proportion to the new question - Since we know that 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, we can multiply 960 (the number of potatoes) by 6 (the number of hash browns per potato) to find out how many hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the result - Perform the multiplication to get the answer.\n\nThat's how I would solve this problem."

To find the proportion, we can divide the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes. This value can then be multiplied by 960 to find the number of hash browns made from 960 potatoes.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Find the proportion of potatoes to hash browns\nhash_browns_per_potato = 360 / 60\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the proportion by 960 to find the number of hash browns\nhash_browns = hash_browns_per_potato * 960\n\nprint(hash_browns)\n```"
