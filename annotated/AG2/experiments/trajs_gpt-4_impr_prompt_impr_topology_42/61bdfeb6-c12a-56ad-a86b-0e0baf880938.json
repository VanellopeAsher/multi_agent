Smart TVs make up one-fourth of the sales, so the number of Smart TVs sold is 1/4 * 40 = 10.\n2. Analog TVs make up one-eighth of the sales, so the number of Analog TVs sold is 1/8 * 40 = 5.\n3. Projection TVs make up one-fifth of the sales, so the number of Projection TVs sold is 1/5 * 40 = 8.\n\nWe then subtract the sum of these three types from the total TV sales:\n\n- OLED TVs sold = Total TVs sold - (Smart TVs + Analog TVs + Projection TVs) = 40 - (10 + 5 + 8)."
