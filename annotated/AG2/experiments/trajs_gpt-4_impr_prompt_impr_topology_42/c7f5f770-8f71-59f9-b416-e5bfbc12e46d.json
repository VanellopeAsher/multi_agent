So 30 - 6 = 24 fries remain.\n\nStep 3: Determine how many fries Billy took. According to the problem, Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which would be 2*6 = 12 fries. So, after deducting Billy's fries, Griffin has 24 - 12 = 12 fries remaining.\n\nStep 4: Determine how many fries Colby took. According to the problem, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, which makes 6 - 3 = 3 fries. If we now subtract this from the number of fries Griffin had left, he would have 12 - 3 = 9 fries.\n\nStep 5: Finally, identify how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin. We know that Griffin ended up with 33 fries, which means that Ginger must have given Griffin 33 - 9 = 24 fries. So the solution to the problem is that Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries. \n\nFeel free to cross-verify it with your calculations."
