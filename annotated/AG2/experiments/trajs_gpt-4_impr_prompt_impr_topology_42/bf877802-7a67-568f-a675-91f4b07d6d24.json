Initially, for the first 10 hours, the sun moves at 5 degrees per hour, while for the subsequent 2 hours, it moves at 3 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total angle covered by the sun over the period would be the sum of the angles covered in each phase. This angle will then be added to the initial angle of 32 degrees from the ground.\n\nHere are the solution steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total angular displacement of the sun for the first 10 hours.\n2. Calculate the total angular displacement of the sun for the following two hours.\n3. Sum up the total angle obtained from steps 1 and 2.\n4. Add the result from step 3 to the initial angle of the pyramid to get the final angle from the ground to the sun.\n\nLet's implement these steps."
