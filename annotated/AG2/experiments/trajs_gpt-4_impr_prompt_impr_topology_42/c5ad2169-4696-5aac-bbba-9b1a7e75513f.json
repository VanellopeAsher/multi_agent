Repeat this process for the coral pieces and fish, adding each to the total. \n    4. The sum of these amounts will be the total expense. \n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\n    Cost of fish tank = $10.00\n    Cost of each stone packet = $2.50; since Scarlett bought two, the total cost of the stone packets will be 2 * $2.50.\n    Cost of each coral piece = $2.00; since she bought three, the total cost of the coral pieces will be 3 * $2.00.\n    Cost of each fish = $0.50; since she bought 20, the total cost of the fish will be 20 * $0.50.\n    Cost of fish food packet = $2.00\n\nBy adding all these values, we will get the total amount spent by Scarlett."
