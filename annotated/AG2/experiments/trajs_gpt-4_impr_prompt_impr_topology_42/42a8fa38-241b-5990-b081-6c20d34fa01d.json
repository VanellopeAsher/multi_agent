Multiply the number of tomato seed packets by the price of a tomato seed packet. This will give us the total spend on tomato seeds.\n2. Multiply the number of celery seed packets by the price of a celery seed packet. This will give us the total spend on celery seeds.\n3. Add the total spend on tomato seeds and the total spend on celery seeds. This will give us the total spend on seeds. \n\nLet's do these calculations:\n\n1. Total spend on tomato seeds: 20 seed packets * $40 per packet = $800.\n2. Total spend on celery seeds: 80 seed packets * $30 per packet = $2400.\n3. Total spend on seeds: $800 (tomatoes) + $2400 (celery) = $3200.\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Rylan spent $3200 purchasing the seeds."
