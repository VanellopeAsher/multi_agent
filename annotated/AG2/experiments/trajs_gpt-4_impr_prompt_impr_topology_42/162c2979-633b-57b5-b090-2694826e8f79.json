For this, we multiply the quantity, which is two packs, by the price per pack, which is $2. So, 2 packs * $2/pack = $4.\n2. Then, calculate the costs of the green apple gum. Since it costs half as much as the grape gum, and the grape gum pack costs $2, the total cost for green apple would be $2/2 = $1.\n3. Finally, sum the prices of all the packs. That is, $4 (for strawberry) + $2 (for grape) + $1 (for green apple) = $7 in total for the four packs of gum. So, Suzie paid $7 in all. \n\nTo verify this solution, Agent_Verifier will review the calculations and confirm the final sum."
