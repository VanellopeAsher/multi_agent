So the total cost is $120 + 2*$100 = $320\n- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she has done this 10 times, so she has earned $5*10 = $50 from babysitting.\n- Sara also has $100 saved from before.\n- The amount Sara has after babysitting and her savings is $100 + $50 = $150\n- The amount Sara still needs is the total cost minus what she has, which is $320 - $150 = $170\n- Sara earns $10 for every time she mows the lawn, to determine how many times she must do this, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns each time: $170 / $10 = 17 times\n\nSo, Sara must mow the lawn 17 times to afford the jacket and shoes."
