Since each package contains six biscuits and Carl bought ten packages, so total number of biscuits would be 6 biscuits/package * 10 packages = 60 biscuits.\n\nStep 2: Next, we calculate the total cost of all biscuits. Each biscuit is priced at $0.10, and Carl bought 60 biscuits, so total cost would be $0.10/biscuit * 60 biscuits = $6.00.\n\nStep 3: Finally, we calculate how much change Carl will receive. He pays with a $10 note, and the total cost of the biscuits is $6.00, so the change will be $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.\n\nSo, Carl will get $4.00 back."
