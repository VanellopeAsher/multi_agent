We do so by subtracting his current bank balance from the bike's price: $300.5 (bike price) - $50.5 (current bank balance) = $250 (amount needed).\n\nNext, we find out how many days Mark must work in order to earn this amount. As Mark earns $12.5 per day, we divide the amount needed ($250) by Mark's daily earning rate ($12.5). This gives us the number of days Mark must work to save enough.\n\nThis can be translated into Python code as below:\n\n    bike_price = 300.5\n    current_balance = 50.5\n    daily_earning = 12.5\n\n    amount_needed = bike_price - current_balance\n    days_needed = amount_needed / daily_earning\n\n`days_needed` will then be the number of days Mark need to save for buying the bike. We can round up this number to the nearest whole number, as Mark cannot work part of a day.\n\n"
