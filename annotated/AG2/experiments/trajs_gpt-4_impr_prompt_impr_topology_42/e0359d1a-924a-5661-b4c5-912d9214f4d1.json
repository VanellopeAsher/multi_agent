Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.\n\n2. Identify the number of people sharing the candy: The candy is being split between Robert, Cindy, and Aaron which makes it 3 people.\n\n3. Determine how much candy each person would receive: We do this by dividing the total amount of candy by the number of people sharing it. So, each person would have 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.\n\nIn conclusion, Robert, Cindy, and Aaron would each have 4 pounds of candy. \n\nLet's have this verified by the Agent Code Executor through coding."

It was then evenly distributed among the 3 individuals, with each receiving 4 lbs of candy.
