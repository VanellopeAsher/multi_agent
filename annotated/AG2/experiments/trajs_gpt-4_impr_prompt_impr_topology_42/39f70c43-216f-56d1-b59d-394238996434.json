In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier.

      "content": "To solve this problem, the steps should go as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the hamburgers by multiplying the price per hamburger by the number of hamburgers ordered. In this case, it would be 5 hamburgers * $4/hamburger = $20.\n\n2. Similarly, calculate the total cost of the potato fries packs: 10 packs * $0.30/pack = $3.\n\n3. For the fruit drinks, we are not given a price so we will assume they are complimentary and cost $0.\n\n4. Add up the total cost of the items ordered: $20 (burgers) + $3 (fries) + $0 (drinks) = $23.\n\n5. Finally, subtract the total cost of the items from the fifty-dollar bill to determine the change Carly gets back. $50 - $23 = $27. Therefore, Carly should get $27 back.\n\n(Note: All calculation should be using the same currency)."
