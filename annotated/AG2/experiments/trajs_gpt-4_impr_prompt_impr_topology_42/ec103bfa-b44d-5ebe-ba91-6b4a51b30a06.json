      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal**: This is given as $120.\n2. **Calculate the total cost for the milk**: Multiply the number of milk packs (5) by the cost per pack ($30). 5 * $30 = $150.\n3. **Calculate the total cost for the apples**: Multiply the number of apples (40) by the cost per apple ($1.50). 40 * $1.50 = $60.\n4. **Compute the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples**: Add the amounts from the previous steps. $120 + $150 + $60 = $330.\n5. **Find the cost of the pizzas**: Subtract the total cost calculated in step 4 from the total amount paid by Marie ($900). $900 - $330 = $570.\n6. **Determine the number of pizza boxes**: Divide the cost of pizzas from step 5 by the price of one pizza box ($57). The result will be the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered. To ensure we find the whole number of boxes, we'll keep only the integer part of the division result because you can't order fractional pizza boxes. For example, you can't order 2.5 pizza boxes. You can either order 2 or 3 pizza boxes.\n\nLet's now solve this problem."
