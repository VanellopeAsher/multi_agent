Calculate the number of Wooden action figures Peter can buy in a day. He can buy $10/$5 = 2 action figures daily.\n2. Multiply the numbers of daily Wooden action figures by the total days he bought them which is 2 * 4 = 8 wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday.\n3. Calculate the number of Plastic action figures Peter can buy in a day. He can buy $10/$2.5 = 4 action figures daily.\n4. Multiply the numbers of daily Plastic action figures by the total days they are bought which is 4 action figures/day * 3 days = 12 plastic action figures.\n5. Add the number of Wooden action figures and Plastic action figures to get the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. That is 8 + 12 = 20 action figures. \n\nThen Peter will have a total of 20 action figures by the end of the week. Let's discuss this solution with other agents."
