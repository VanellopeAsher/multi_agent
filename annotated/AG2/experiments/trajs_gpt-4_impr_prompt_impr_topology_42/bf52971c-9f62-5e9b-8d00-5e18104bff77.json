The steps outlined by Agent Problem Solver are clear and precise, and they've correctly followed the sequence of events described in the problem. Agent Code Executor has correctly implemented the proposed steps in Python and ended up with $32.0, which appears to be correct.\n\nI will now evaluate their responses in detail:\n\n1. Initially, Ali had a total amount of $160.0, which is correct as per the problem statement (4 * $10 + 6 * $20).\n2. Ali then gave half of his total money to his sister, which leaves him with $80.0. This has been confirmed as correct in both solutions.\n3. Ali then spent 3/5 of his remaining money on dinner. According to the calculation given above, this was $48.0. \n4. Now, Ali only has the money that was left after buying dinner, which was correctly calculated as $32.0.\n\nWe can therefore confirm that both the sequential steps provided by Agent Problem Solver and the Python code provided by Agent Code Executor were correct in solving the problem, and Ali has $32.0 left. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: $32.0."
