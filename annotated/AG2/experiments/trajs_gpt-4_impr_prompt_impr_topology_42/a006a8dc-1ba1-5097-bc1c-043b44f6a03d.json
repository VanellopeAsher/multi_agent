As stated, the girls gathered an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys and 4.5 times this number.\n   \n2. To find the number of seashells gathered by each girl, we would add the number of seashells gathered by the boys (60) to 4.5 times the number of seashells gathered by the boys (4.5 * 60).\n\n3. Following these steps, we can determine the amount of seashells each girl gathers."
