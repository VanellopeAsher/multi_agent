      "content": "To solve this problem, you first need to understand that Harry is getting 80 feet more of the fence than Sam. This means that whatever amount of fence Sam gets, Harry gets that amount plus an extra 80 feet.\n\nLet's say the amount of fence that Sam gets is x feet. Because Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 80 feet of the fence. \n\nSince the total length of the fence they have to split is 200 feet, you can set up the equation:\n\nx (Sam's portion) + x + 80 (Harry's portion) = 200\n\nThis simplifies to 2x + 80 = 200\n\nNow, you can solve for x to find out how much fence Sam gets. First, you subtract 80 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 200 - 80\n\nThen, you divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = (200 - 80) / 2\n\nSo, x is the amount of fence in feet that Sam gets."

According to the problem, Harry gets 'x + 80' feet of the fence.\n3. Since the total length of the fence is 200 feet, we can write an equation that reflects the sum of both parts: 'x + (x + 80) = 200'.\n4. Simplify the equation and solve for 'x', which will specify the length of the fence Sam gets.\n\nLet's execute these steps in Python."

Agent Code Executor followed a similar approach and provided a Python code snippet to determine x using symbolic computation. The code was executed successfully and also resulted in x, the amount of fence that Sam gets, being equal to 60.\n\nBased upon my review, both solutions are in agreement and correct. Thus, Sam receives 60 feet of the fence.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 60"
