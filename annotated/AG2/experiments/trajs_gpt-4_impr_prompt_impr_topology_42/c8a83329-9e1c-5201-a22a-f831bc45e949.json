Add the number of premade Valentine's cards her dad brought her. Since there's no given number of cards in the boxes, let's assume each box contained 1 card, therefore adding 2 cards to her total.\n3. Subtract the number of Valentine's cards she passed out to her classmates (24) and to her family (5).\n4. Finally, add the number of Valentine's cards Erica received from family and friends, which is 17.\n\nSo the calculation becomes: 20 (created) + 2 (from dad) - 24 (passed to classmates) - 5 (passed to family) + 17 (received) = Final number of Valentine's cards Erica has now.\n\nThe next step is to perform the actual arithmetic calculation."
