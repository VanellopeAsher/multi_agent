      "content": "To solve this problem, let's start by calculating the cost of ingredients per jar.\n\n1. First, we calculate the cost of passion fruit per jar. Since 2 pounds are required and the cost per pound is $6, the total cost is 2 * $6 = $12.\n2. Next, we determine the cost of jackfruit per jar. Given that 1.5 pounds are used and the cost per pound is $8, the total cost is 1.5 * $8 = $12.\n3. After that, we calculate the cost of honey per jar. Since 2 pounds are required and the cost per pound is $10, the total cost is 2 * $10 = $20.\n4. Finally, we add up the cost of each ingredient to determine the total cost of making one jar of the mixture. So, the total cost per jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44.\n5. To find the profit from selling one jar, we subtract the cost from the sale price. With each jar being sold at $50, the profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6.\n6. If Tim sells 10 jars, his total profit would be $6 (profit per jar) * 10 (number of jars) = $60.  \n\nSo, Tim makes $60 in profit by selling 10 jars of his special mixture."
