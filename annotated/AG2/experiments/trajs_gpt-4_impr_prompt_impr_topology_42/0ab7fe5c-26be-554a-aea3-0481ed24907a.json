For blue tulips: he buys 2.4 times of ten blue tulips, so the total number will be 2.4 * 10 = 24 blue tulips.\n\nSecond, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color:\n\n3. Red rows: Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row, so the number of red rows is 36 red tulips / 6 = 6 rows.\n4. Blue rows: Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, so the number of blue rows is 24 blue tulips / 8 = 3 rows.\n\nFinally, to get the total number of rows he will plant, sum up the number of red rows and blue rows:\n\n5.
