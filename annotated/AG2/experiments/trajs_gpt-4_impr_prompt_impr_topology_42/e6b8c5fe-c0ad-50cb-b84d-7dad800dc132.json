      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total money Colby has. Then we will determine the number of gumballs he can buy. Since we don't know the price of each gumball, I'll assume that each gumball costs 25 cents (or 1 quarter) which is a common price for gumballs in vending machines. If the price is different, please let me know.\n\nHere are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Convert all coins to cents:\n   - 1 quarter is 25 cents.\n   - 1 dime is 10 cents.\n   - 1 nickel is 5 cents.\n   - 1 penny is 1 cent.\n\n2. Multiply the number of each coin by its value in cents:\n   - Colby has 8 quarters, so that's 8 * 25 = 200 cents.\n   - He has 6 dimes, so that's 6 * 10 = 60 cents.\n   - He has 14 nickels, so that's 14 * 5 = 70 cents.\n   - He has 15 pennies, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 cents.\n\n3. Add up all the amounts to find the total money Colby has.\n\n4. Divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball (25 cents) to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy. \n\n5. If there is a remainder after division, that means Colby doesn't have enough money left to buy another gumball. So we only count the whole number of gumballs he can buy."
