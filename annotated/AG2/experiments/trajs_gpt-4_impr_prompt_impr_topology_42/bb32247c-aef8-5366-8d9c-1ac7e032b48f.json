Initial height in the first week = x inches.\n    2. Height after the second week = 2*x inches (since it doubled).\n    3. Height after the third week = 2*x+4 inches (it grew an additional 4 inches).\n\nSo, assuming the initial height of the beanstalk in the first week was 'x' inches, the total height after 3 weeks would be 2*x + 4 inches. \n\nIn the absence of exact values, however, we cannot derive a concrete answer."
