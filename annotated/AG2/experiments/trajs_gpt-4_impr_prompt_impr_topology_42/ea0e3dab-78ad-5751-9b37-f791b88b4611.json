Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, and she is charged $200 per month, she will pay 6 * 200 = $1200 for the first half of the year.\n\n2. The streaming company then charged Aleena 15% less for the second half of the year. To find the reduced charge, we calculate 15% of $200, which is 15/100 * 200 = $30. So, the reduced monthly charge is 200 - 30 = $170.\n\n3. Then, calculate the total amount Aleena is charged for the second half of the year. Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, and she is charged $170 per month, she will pay 6 * 170 = $1020 for the second half of the year.\n\n4. Finally, to find the total amount she pays for the whole year, add the amount she paid in the first half of the year to the amount she paid in the second half of the year : 1200 + 1020 = $2220."

For the second half of the year, Aleena is charged 15% less. Hence, the charge for each month in the second half of the year is 200 - 0.15 * 200.\n3. The total charge for the second half of the year is again 6 multiplied by the charge per month in the second half of the year (calculated in the previous step).\n4. Finally, the total amount charged for the year is simply the sum of the totals for the first and second halves of the year.\n\nWe can use Sympy to perform these calculations.
