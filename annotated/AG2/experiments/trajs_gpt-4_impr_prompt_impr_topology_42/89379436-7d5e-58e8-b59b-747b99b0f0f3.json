The length of the shark's body.\n\nThe total length of the remoras can be discovered by multiplying the number of remoras by their individual lengths. Therefore, the total length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.\n\nThe percentage of the shark's body that is the combined length of the remoras cannot be calculated unless we have a precise measure of the shark's body length. Unfortunately, this problem does not currently provide adequate information to derive an accurate percentage."
