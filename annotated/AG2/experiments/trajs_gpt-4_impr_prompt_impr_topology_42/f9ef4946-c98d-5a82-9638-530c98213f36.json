On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour-long episode each night, which equals 2 hours in total.\n2. On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes which equals 1.5 hours (because 3 * 30 minutes = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours).\n3. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours of TV (an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show).\n4. On Friday, he watched two one-hour episodes which is 2 hours in total.\n\nTherefore, by summing up the hours, we get the total amount of time Frankie spent watching TV. Let's calculate it now."
