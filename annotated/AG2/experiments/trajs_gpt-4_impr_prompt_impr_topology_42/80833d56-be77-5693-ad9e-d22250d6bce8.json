He runs 10 hours on the first day and then half of that time (which is 5 hours) on each of the remaining two days. \n\n# Step 2: Calculate John's speed.\nAfter calculating the total running time, we can find out John's speed by dividing the total distance he runs in a week (100 miles) by his total running time. Speed is defined as the quotient of distance and time.\n\nLet's calculate this.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the total time John spent running\ntime_first_day = 10  # hours\ntime_second_day = time_first_day / 2  # hours\ntime_third_day = time_first_day / 2  # hours\n\ntotal_running_time = time_first_day + time_second_day + time_third_day  # hours\n\n# Step 2: Calculate John's speed\ntotal_distance = 100  # miles\n\nspeed = total_distance / total_running_time  # miles per hour\n\nprint(speed)\n```\nWill run this as soon as you request me to.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
