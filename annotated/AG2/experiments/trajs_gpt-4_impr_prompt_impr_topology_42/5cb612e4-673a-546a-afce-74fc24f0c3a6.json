The trader sells each bag for $30, so after considering the total cost, the profit per bag is $30 - $22 equals $8.\n\n3) Finally, calculate the number of bags the farmer sold. If the total profit is $400, and each bag brought in a profit of $8, then the farmer sold $400 / $8 equals 50 bags.\n\nIn the end, the solution should be 50 bags if all computations are correct."
