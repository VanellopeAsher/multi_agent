Calculate the total cashback from the app which is 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00\n3. Subtract the cashback from the full gas price, which gives $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00\n4. Apply the coupon which offers a 10% discount on the price after cutting cashback. So, the discount is $28.00 * 10% = $2.8\n5. Finally, subtract the discount from the price after the cashback, which results in $28.00 - $2.8 = $25.2 \n\nSo, they will pay $25.2 for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon. \n\nLet's discuss this solution."

Then, I'll calculate the total cashback by multiplying the cashback per gallon by the gallons bought. I'll subtract this from the initial total cost.\n4.

So, I can confidently affirm that this is the correct amount the customer needs to pay after taking the cashback and the coupon into account.\n\nTo wrap up:\nThe customer has to pay the full amount for 10 gallons of gas, which comes to 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00. They'll then receive a cashback of 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00. The price after cashback is thus $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00. Then, they apply a 10% discount on that $28.00, resulting in a reduction of $28.00 * 10% = $2.80. The final price after the cashback and coupon is therefore $28.00 - $2.80 = $25.20. \n\nThe Python code provided by Agent Code Executor encapsulates these calculations and could be reused efficiently if the gas prices, cashback per gallon, or coupon discounts change.\n\nAll agents aligned on these steps and the final solution, and their proposals are therefore verified."
