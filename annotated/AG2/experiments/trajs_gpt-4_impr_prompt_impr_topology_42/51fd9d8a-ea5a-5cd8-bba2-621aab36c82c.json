      "content": "Firstly, let's translate the question into mathematical expressions:\n\n1. The combined age of Peter, Paul and John is 0.1 times of one thousand years old. Or in other words:\n\n    `Peter + Paul + John = 0.1 * 1000 = 100 years`\n    \n2. Paul is 0.1 times of one hundred years older than John. Or in other words:\n\n    `Paul = John + 0.1 * 100 = John + 10 years`\n\n3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. Or in other words:\n\n    `Peter = Paul + John`\n\nNow that we have three equations, we can solve them to find the age of each individual:\n\nStep 1: Plug the second equation (Paul's age) into the first and the third equation: \n\n    1.1: Peter + John + 10 + John = 100\n    1.2: Peter = John + 10 + John \n\nStep 2: Solve the equation 1.1:\n\n    2 John + Peter = 90\n    Peter = 90 - 2 John  \n\nStep 3 : Plug the third equation Peter = 2 John into the second equation: \n\n    Peter = 2 John  = 2(John +10)\n    Peter =  2 John = 20 + 2 John \n\nComparing step 2 and step 3, \n\n    90 - 2 John = 20 + 2 John \n    --> 70 = 4 John \n    --> John = 17.5 years old \n\nStep 4: Find Peter and Paul's age using John's age :\n\n    Peter = 2 * 17.5 = 35 years old \n    Paul = 17.5 + 10 = 27.5 years old \n\nSo, Peter is 35 years old. \n\nNow I'll write out the final solution in a clear, presentable format:\n\nSolution: Peter is 35 years old."

Paul = John + 10\n    3. Peter = Paul + John\n\nThese equations represent a system of linear equations with three variables (Peter, Paul, John). We can solve these equations using Python. For this purpose, we can use the `SymPy` package in Python, which stands for Symbolic Mathematics in Python. It has a built-in function `solve()` that can solve systems of equations. \n\nWe will create symbols for our variables using `Symbol()` method, specify the equations, and then we can solve them.\n\nLet's implement this now:"
