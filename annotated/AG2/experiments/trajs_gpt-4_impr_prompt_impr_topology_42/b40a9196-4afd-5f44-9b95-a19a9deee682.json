Calculate the total cost of non-food items which is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.\n3. Calculate the tax on the non-food items which is 10 dollars * 10% = 1 dollar.\n4. Finally, calculate the total cost of all items which is cost of food items + cost of non-food items + tax on non-food items = 5 dollars + 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 16 dollars. \n\nSo, the total cost of all the items is 16 dollars."
