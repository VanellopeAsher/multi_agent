Determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. From the problem, we know that 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns. So the ratio is 60:360.\n2. Simplify the ratio. Both 60 and 360 can be divided by 60, which makes the ratio 1:6.\n3. Use the simplified ratio to calculate the number of hash browns that can be made out of 960 potatoes. If 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, therefore, 960 potatoes would make 960 * 6 hash browns."

Therefore we can calculate the hash browns per potato.\n2. Once we have the hash browns per potato we can multiply it by 960 to find out how many hash browns would 960 potatoes make.\n\nSo this is how we can write the code:\n\n```python\n# initial number of potatoes\ninitial_potatoes = 60\n# initial number of hash browns\ninitial_hashbrowns = 360\n\n# calculate hash browns per potato\nhashbrowns_per_potato = initial_hashbrowns / initial_potatoes\n\n# new number of potatoes\nnew_potatoes = 960\n\n# calculate hash browns for new potatoes\nnew_hashbrowns = hashbrowns_per_potato * new_potatoes\n\nprint(new_hashbrowns)\n```\n\nThis should print out the number of hash browns that can be made from 960 potatoes."
