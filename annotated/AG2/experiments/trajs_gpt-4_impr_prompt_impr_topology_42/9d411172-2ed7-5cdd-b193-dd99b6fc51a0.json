Calculate the maximum cost per class: $20\n2. Calculate the number of classes Manny needs to attend: $80 / $20 = 4 classes\n3. Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss: 12 total classes - 4 mandatory classes = 8 classes\n\nSo, Manny can miss 8 classes before his parents won't sign him up again."
