So, we multiply 6 (decks) by 25 (cards).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has.\n- She has five boxes and each box contains 40 cards. So, we multiply 5 (boxes) by 40 (cards).\n\nStep 3: Add the totals of basketball cards, baseball cards, and soccer cards together to get the total number of sports cards Miss Maria initially has.\n\nStep 4: Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps (50 cards) from the total number of cards to find the number of cards she gives to her students.\n\nStep 5: To find the number of students, divide the number of cards Miss Maria gives to her students by the number of cards each student receives (10 cards). \n\nThe final answer should be rounded down to the nearest whole number because it isn't possible to have a fraction of a student. \n\nFinally, it is always a good idea to check whether the solution makes sense in the context of the problem. For example, the number of students should be a non-negative integer."
