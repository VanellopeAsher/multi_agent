Therefore, if we multiply 2000 (the number of helmets) by 2, we will get 4000 footballs.\n\nAdding all these values together (2000 helmets + 1000 robots + 4000 footballs) will give us the total number of items Dominick saw.

Since there are 2000 helmets this means he saw 2000/2 = 1000 robots.\n     2. Computing the number of footballs: Dominick saw twice as many footballs as helmets. So, he saw 2000*2 = 4000 footballs.\n     3. Adding all items: We add the number of robots, helmets and footballs which gives us the total number of items.\n\n```python\n\n# number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n# Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets \nrobots = helmets/2\n# Dominick saw twice as many footballs as helmets\nfootballs = helmets*2\n# total items that Dominick saw will be the sum of robots, helmets and footballs\ntotal_items = helmets + robots + footballs    \nprint(total_items)\n```\n\nLet's run the above python code snippet to get the total number of items."
