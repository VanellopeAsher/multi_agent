Then he did 1,000 steps with his friend.\n4. After this, he did another 500 steps going shopping.\n5. So the total number of steps Elliott had done before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500 steps.\n6. If the jog was done when he had 2,000 steps remaining, this means that after the jog he had taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.\n7. Therefore, during his jog, Elliott took 8,000 steps - 6,500 steps = 1,500 steps."
