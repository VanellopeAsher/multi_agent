From the total of 6000, we subtract Richard's and Robert's cherries to find out Jerry's amount. Robert's cherries minus Jerry's cherries give us the answer, which is how much more Robert has than Jerry. \n\nIn the case of Agent Code Executor, he/she has suggested to implement the exact same steps that were laid out by the Problem Solver in Python code which gave the result as 2000 cherries, which matches the solution given by the Problem Solver.\n\nHence, cross-verifying both correlations, the final solution is consistent. Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 2000"
