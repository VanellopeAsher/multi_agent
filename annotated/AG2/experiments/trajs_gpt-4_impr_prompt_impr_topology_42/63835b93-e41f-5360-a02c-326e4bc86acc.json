Neutering costs $150\n2. Two vaccines cost $30 each, so this will be 2 * $30 = $60\n3. The kitten broke three vases that cost $15 each, which will total 3 * $15 = $45\n4. Adding these all up, we get: $150 + $60 + $45 = $255\n\nNow our job is to validate all these steps:\n\n- Here, we see that Agent Problem Solver used 2 for the \"vaccine_count\" and 3 for the \"vase_count\". From the initial problem, we can confirm that these are the correct values.\n- Both agents used $30 for the \"vaccine_cost\" and $15 for the \"vase_cost\", which are also correct according to the initial problem.\n- Agent Problem Solver added all the costs ($150, $60, $45), also used in Agent Code Executor's code and correctly summed them up to $255.\n\nBy meticulously following the above steps, I can confirm that both agents' solutions are correct. So, the kitten has cost Leah $255 so far.\n\nFinal solution: SOLUTION_FOUND $255."
