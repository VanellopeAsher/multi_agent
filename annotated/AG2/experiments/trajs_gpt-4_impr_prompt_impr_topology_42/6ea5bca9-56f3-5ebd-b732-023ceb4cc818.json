So, x + 3x + 3x + 0.12= 3.41.\n\nStep 5: Solving the equation, we can find the value of x.\n\nStep 6: Once we know the number of cards PJ has, we can multiply it by 3 and add 0.12 to find the number of cards Becca has.\n\nThe resulting number from step 6 is the solution to this problem. It represents the number of cards Becca has. Let's calculate the solution."
