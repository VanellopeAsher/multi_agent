      "content": "Let's solve this problem using a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Let's define the number of Magic Cards PJ has as P.\n2. According to the problem statement, Smendrick has 4 times the number of Magic Cards as PJ. We can express this as S = 4P.\n3. The problem also says that Becca has 15 more Magic Cards than Smendrick, which can be expressed as B = S + 15.\n4. The total number of cards can therefore be presented as B + S + P = 447.\n5. We can now substitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3 into the total equation from step 4, which gets us (4P+15) + 4P + P = 447.\n6. If we solve the equation step-by-step, we get the number of cards each person has:\n    a. Combine the like terms to simplify the equation: 9P + 15 = 447.\n    b. Subtract 15 from both sides to isolate the term with P: 9P = 432.\n    c. Divide both sides by 9 to find the value of P: P = 48.\n7. Now that we know how many cards PJ has, we can use the relationship from step 3 to figure out how many cards Becca has: B = 4P + 15 = 4*48 + 15 = 207 Magic Cards.\n\nTherefore, Becca has 207 Magic Cards."
