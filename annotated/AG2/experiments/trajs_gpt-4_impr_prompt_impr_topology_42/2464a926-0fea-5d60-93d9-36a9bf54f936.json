Since they prepared 10 sets of balloons, each containing 30 balloons, the total number of balloons can be calculated by multiplying the number of sets by the number of balloons in each set.\n\n2. Subtract the number of remaining balloons from the total number of balloons prepared. This will give us the total number of balloons used. \n\nLet's start solving:\nStep 1: The total number of balloons prepared is 10 sets * 30 balloons/set = 300 balloons.\nStep 2: The number of balloons used is the total number of balloons prepared minus the remaining balloons. So, the balloons used is 300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons.\n\nIn conclusion, 288 balloons were used in the water balloon fight."
