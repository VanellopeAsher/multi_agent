Benny saw 2 remoras, each measuring 6 inches, so we multiply 2 by 6 to find the total length of the remoras. \n\nStep 2: We know that the total length of the remoras accounts for 10% of the shark's body length. Therefore, to find the shark's body length, we divide the total length of the remoras by 0.10 (which represents 10%).\n\nThese steps should allow us to calculate the length of the shark."
