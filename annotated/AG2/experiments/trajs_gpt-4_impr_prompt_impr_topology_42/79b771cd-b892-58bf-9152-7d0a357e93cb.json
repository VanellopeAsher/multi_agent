We know that the gemstone triples her throwing distance, so when she's holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 4000 feet * 3 = 12,000 feet.\n\n2. Next, subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the distance that Polly can throw the javelin when she's holding the gemstone.\n   \n   This calculation is 12,000 feet - 10,000 feet = 2,000 feet using the information given in the problem.\n\nThe resulting distance, 2000 feet, is how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the gemstone."

The calculations are correct; Polly can throw the javelin 4000 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther (12000 feet). Substracting the reach of the dragon's flame (10000), we can determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\n\nFollowing these steps and based on the proposed solutions, the safe distance is 2000 feet.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{2000} feet"
