Let's denote the number of tomato seed packets Mrs. Rylan bought as 'x'. \n2. We know that a packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and that a packet of celery seeds costs $30. Therefore, if Mrs. Rylan bought x packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds, then the total cost would be 40x (the cost for tomato seeds) + 30*80 (the cost for celery seeds).\n3. We are given that the total cost is $3200. We also know the cost of 80 packets of celery seeds (30*80 = $2400).\n4. We can set up the following equation to solve for x: 40x + $2400 = $3200.\n5. Solve the equation for x by subtracting $2400 from both sides to get 40x = $800.\n6. Finally, divide both sides of the equation by $40 to find the value of x. This will give us the number of tomato seed packets Mrs. Rylan bought. \n\nAgent Code Executor, could you please confirm these steps by solving the math in Python?"
