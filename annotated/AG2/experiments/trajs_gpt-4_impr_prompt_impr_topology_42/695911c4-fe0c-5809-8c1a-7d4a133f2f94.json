Since she visits the museum three times a year at $10 per visit, this comes to 10 years * 3 visits/year * $10/visit = $300.\n \n2. Next, find out the new cost of one visit after the price increased by 150%. This is $10 + $10 * 150/100 = $25.\n \n3. Calculate the total amount Pauline spent during the following 3 years. With the increased cost, this comes to 3 years * 3 visits/year * $25/visit = $225.\n \n4. Add the amount Pauline spent during the first 10 years to the amount she spent during the last 3 years to find the total. That's $300 from the first 10 years + $225 from the last 3 years = $525. \n\nSo Pauline spent a total of $525 on all her visits to the museum over the 13 years."

It means Pauline spent a total of 525 dollars on all her visits to the museum. \n\nBoth agents' solutions are absolutely correct and they match.
