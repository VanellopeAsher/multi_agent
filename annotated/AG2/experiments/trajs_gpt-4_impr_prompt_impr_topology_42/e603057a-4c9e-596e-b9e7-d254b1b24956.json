Here is the detailed step-by-step solution:\n\nLet's use the following variables:\n- Let S be the current age of Seth,\n- Let B be the current age of Brooke,\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following two equations:\n1. \"Seth is twice as old as Brooke\" can be translated to: S = 2B.\n2. \"In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36\" can be translated to: (S+3) + (B+3) = 36.\n\nWe can solve these equations in the following way:\n1. Substitute S from the first equation into the second: (2B+3) + (B+3) = 36,\n2. Simplify the equation to find the value of B: 3B + 6 = 36,\n3. Extract the value of B: 3B = 30 -> B = 10.\n4. Substitute B back into the first equation to find the value of S: S = 2*10 = 20.\n\nSo, Seth is currently 20 years old."
