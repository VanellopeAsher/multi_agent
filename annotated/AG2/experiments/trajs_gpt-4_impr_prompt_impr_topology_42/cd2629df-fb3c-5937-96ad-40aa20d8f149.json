      "content": "Sure, this problem seems to be based on a combination of concepts from simple interest, loan repayment and budget management. Here is how we can solve it:\n\nStep 1. Determine the total repayment amount:\nStephen's total repayment amount includes the loan and interest. The loan amount is $300. The interest rate is 2%. Thus, the total repayment amount is $300 + 2% of $300.\n\nStep 2. Calculate the repayment amount for the first 11 months:\nStephen repays $25 each month for 11 months. Hence, the total repayment Stephen has made in the first 11 months is $25 * 11.\n\nStep 3. Determine the remaining debt:\nSubtract the amount repaid in the first 11 months from the total repayment amount. \n\nStep 4. Calculate Stephen's payment in the twelfth month:\nStephen's payment in the twelfth month is equal to the remaining debt.\n\nThings to note: \n- His $50 monthly coin purchases do not affect his repayment to his sister as they are independent of each other.\n- The $100 coin he plans to buy in the twelfth month isn't included in the calculation because the question explicitly excludes his coin purchases.\n- Since the interest is not compounded (we don't have information about that in the problem), it's safe to assume that the 2% interest is calculated only one time on the original borrowed amount of $300, not monthly. \n\nWe can apply these steps to calculate the value."
