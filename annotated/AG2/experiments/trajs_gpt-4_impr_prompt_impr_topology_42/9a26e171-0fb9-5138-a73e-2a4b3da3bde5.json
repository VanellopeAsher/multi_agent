And the students who do not have a desktop computer at home form the remaining one-fourth of this total number, which we are told is 20 students.\n\nSo, we can write this as: \n1/4 * x = 20\n\nSolving this equation will give us the total number of students in the grade level, x.\n\nThen, the problem tells us that these 20 students are just one-third of the number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer at home. Which means the total number of students without either a desktop or a laptop is 3 times this number, or 3 * 20.\n\nBy adding these two numbers together, the total number of students with a desktop and the number of students without either a desktop or a laptop, we can find the total number of students at the grade level. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n1. Solve for x in the equation 1/4 * x = 20.\n2. Multiply the number of students without a desktop (20) by 3 to find the total number of students without either a desktop or a laptop.\n3. Add these two numbers together to find the total number of students at the grade level."

The number of students without either a desktop or a laptop computer is three times the number of students without a desktop computer: 3 * 20.\n\n3. The total number of students is the sum of the number of students with a desktop computer and the number of students without either a desktop or a laptop computer. We need to solve for x based on the first equation, substitute this into the third equation, and solve for x.\n\nLet's write this in Python. Remember that the variable x represents our total number of students at the grade level."
