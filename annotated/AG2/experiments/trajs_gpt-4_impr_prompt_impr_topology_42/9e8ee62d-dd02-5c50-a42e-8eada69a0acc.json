In the second week, the height of the beanstalk doubled. This means the height became 2 * 3 = 6 inches.\n3. The height of the beanstalk after the third week was given as 10 inches.\n\nTo get the growth in the third week, we subtract the height at the end of the second week from the height at the end of the third week. This means the growth in the third week is 10 - 6 = 4 inches. \n\nSo, the beanstalk grew 4 inches in the third week."
