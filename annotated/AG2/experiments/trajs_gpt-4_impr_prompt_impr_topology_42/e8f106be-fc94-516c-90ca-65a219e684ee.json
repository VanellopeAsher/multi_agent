Here, the length of the rectangle is 20 feet, while the width is 15 feet. Therefore, the perimeter is 2 * (20 + 15), giving us 70 feet.\n\nJames will not place any streamers on the tree, so the height of the tree isn't relevant to our calculation.\n\nIn conclusion, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
