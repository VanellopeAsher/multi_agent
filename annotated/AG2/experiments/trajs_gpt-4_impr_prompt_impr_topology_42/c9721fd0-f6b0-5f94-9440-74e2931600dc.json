      "content": "To solve this problem, I suggest following these steps:\n\n1. Patty's Plumbing has a flat service fee of $40 for a house call. This doesn't depend on the time spent or the parts used. So, this is a fixed cost for any job.\n2. The labor cost is $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour. Since the job required 2.25 hours, and any fraction of an hour is billed as a full hour, the total hours billed would be 3.\n3. To calculate the cost of labor, multiply the total hours billed (which is 3) by the cost per hour (which is $35).\n4. The cost of parts used is given as $60. This is added to the total cost regardless of time or service fee.\n5. To calculate the total amount billed by Patty, add the service fee, the cost for labor, and the cost of parts.\n\nThe resulting sum will be the total amount due."

      "content": "Sure, this is a relatively straightforward problem. Here's how you could solve it with Python:\n\n1. Define the cost of the service fee, cost per hour, hours worked, and cost of parts.\n2. As the hours are billed per full hour, round up the hours worked to the nearest whole number. We can use the `math.ceil()` function for this purpose.\n3. Calculate the total cost of labor by multiplying the cost per hour with the total hours billed.\n4. Calculate the total amount billed by adding the service fee, the total cost of labor, and the cost of parts.\n5. Print the total amount billed."
