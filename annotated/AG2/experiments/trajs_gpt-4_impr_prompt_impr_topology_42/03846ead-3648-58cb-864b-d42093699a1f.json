Since Alex collected 60 points, Bella collected 60 points + 30% of 60 points.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of points that Tim has collected. Given that Tim has 40 points less than Bella, subtract 40 points from the total number of points that Bella collected.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of points that Mary has collected. Since Mary has 3 times more points than Tim, multiply the number of points that Tim has collected by 3.\n\nStep 4: Find the total number of points that have been collected using the equation: Total points = Points of Alex + Points of Bella + Points of Mary + Points of Tim\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of points the class is missing to reach the threshold for the field trip. Subtract the total number of points collected by the class from the minimum threshold of 500 points. If the result is negative, the class has surpassed the minimum requirement for the field trip. If the result is positive, the class is missing that number of points to reach the field trip."
