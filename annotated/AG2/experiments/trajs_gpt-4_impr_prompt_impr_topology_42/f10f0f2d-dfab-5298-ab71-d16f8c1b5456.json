Find out how much Gerald earned from the daycare center:\n  - The daycare pays Gerald $30 for each day he works.\n  - Gerald worked for a week, which typically consists of 7 days.\n  - Therefore, his total earnings from the daycare center are $30/day * 7 days = $210.\n\n2. Determine how much he earned from babysitting:\n  - He babysat his neighbor's kids for 2 hours each day, but the job does not pay any money ($0/hour).\n\n3. Calculate his total earnings:\n  - His total earnings are therefore the sum of his daycare earnings and babysitting wages.\n  - Since Gerald didn't earn any money for babysitting, his total earnings are simply his daycare earnings, which equate to $210.\n\n4. Now, subtract his expenses from his total earnings to find out how much money he has left:\n  - He spent a total of $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n  - Subtract this amount from his total income: $210 - $100 = $110.\n\nSo, Gerald has $110 left after earning money from his jobs and spending on necessities."
