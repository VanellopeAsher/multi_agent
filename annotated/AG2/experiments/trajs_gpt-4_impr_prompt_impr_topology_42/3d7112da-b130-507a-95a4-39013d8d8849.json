      "content": "Here are the steps to solve the task:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how much time John spent swimming. We know that he spent half the time he spent boating on swimming. So, swimming time = 0.5 * boating time = 0.5 * 6.6 = 3.3 hours.\n\n2. Then, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching shows. Each show was 2.5 hours long and he watched 3 shows in total, so the total show time = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5 hours.\n\n3. We know that the time John spent boating, swimming, and watching shows made up 30% of his total time. So, the time spent on these three activities is 30/100 * total time. Adding up the times spent swimming, boating, and watching shows gives us a total of 6.6 hours + 3.3 hours + 7.5 hours = 17.4 hours. \n\n4. Therefore, the total time John spent on vacation is found by solving the equation 0.3 * total time = 17.4. This gives total time = 17.4 / 0.3 = 58 hours approximately.\n\n5. Finally, if John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we find the time spent sightseeing by taking 40% of the total time. So, sightseeing time = 0.4 * total time = 0.4 * 58 = 23.2 hours. \n\nFrom these calculations, we conclude that John spent approximately 23.2 hours sightseeing."
