This is her previous score (225 points) plus her new points (10 points), which equals 235 points.\n  \nStep 2: Deduct Marcy's total point (235 points) from Joey's score (214 point) before his turn. The result is the number of points Joey needs to score in his turn to beat Marcy.\n\nStep 3: If Joey scores more than this number, then he is winning by the difference between his score and Marcy's total points.\n\nThis will give us a complete answer."

If Joey is able to score more than 21 points (which is the difference between Marcy's total points and Joey's score before his turn), he would be leading the game.
