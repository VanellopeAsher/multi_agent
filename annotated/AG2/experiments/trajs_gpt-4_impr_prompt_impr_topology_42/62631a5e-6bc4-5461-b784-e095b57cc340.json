Since it's stated that Collins received 150 more corn chips than the number the others got, we add the number of corn chips one person got to the excess. Hence 700 + 150 = 850.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of corn chips. Since we know the number of corn chips each individual got, we add these together.
