The total cost of the phones will be 5 * $700 = $3500.\n2. Add the cost of the tablet and the headphones to the total cost of the phones. The new total cost will be $3500 + $330 + $137 = $3967.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the amount given to calculate the change. The change will be $4000 - $3967 = $33. This means the seller will give back $33 in change."
