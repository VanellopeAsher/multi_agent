We need to establish how much money was collected before the lawyer's contribution: initial amount = money from neighbors + money from online fund = $500 + $1500 = $2000.\n2. Now let's consider the lawyer's donation. His contribution is three times everybody else's donations. He donated $6600, so $6600 = 3 * everyone else's donations. From this, everyone else's donations = $6600/3 = $2200.\n3. The friend's donation can be deduced by subtracting the initial amount (money from the neighbors and the online fund) from the total amount contributed before the lawyer's donation. If $2200 were collected in total before the lawyer contributed, and $2000 was the initial amount, then the friend must have donated $2200 - $2000 = $200.\n4. Therefore, Walter's friend gave him $200."
