      "content": "Here's how to solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. Sum the current clients and potential clients to get the total number of clients. That would be 3 (current clients) + 5 (potential clients) = 8 clients.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of bleach per week. Since each home requires 2 bottles of bleach and each bottle costs $2, then the total cost of bleach for the week would be 2 (bottles) * $2 (cost per bottle) * 8 (clients) = $32.\n\n3. The total income is given as $92 and the profit is given as $20. We know that Profit = Income - Expenses. Therefore, we can calculate the total weekly expenses as Income - Profit. That would be $92 (income) - $20 (profit) = $72 (expenses).\n\n4. The total expenses consist of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths. So the total cost of cloths per week would be total expenses - cost of bleach = $72 (expenses) - $32 (bleach) = $40.\n\n5. Finally, each pack of cloths cost would be the total cost of cloths divided by the total number of clients. That would be $40 (cloths cost) / 8 (clients) = $5.\n\nSo, each pack of cloths costs $5.\n"
