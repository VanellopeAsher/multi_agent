Since there are 3 sisters who are all the same age, the combined age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48 years old.\n\n3. Determine the age of the younger brother: the younger brother is 3/5 of 20 years old, which means his age is 3/5 * 20 = 12 years old.\n\n4. The younger brother's age is half the age of the older brother, therefore, the older brother is 2 * 12 = 24 years old.\n\n5. Add up the ages of all the siblings: The total age is 48 years (from the sisters) + 12 years (from the younger brother) + 24 years (from the older brother) = 84 years. \n\nSo, the total age of all these siblings is 84 years."
