Convert all quantities of brownies to individual units:  \n  - Her personal batch was one dozen which equals 12 brownies.\n  - The office gave her half a dozen which is equivalent to 6 brownies.\n  - The surprise party had 4 dozens of brownies, giving a total of 48 brownies.\n\n2. Add up the total number of brownies she received throughout the day:\n  - 12 from her personal batch.\n  - 6 from the office.\n  - 48 from the surprise party.\n\n3. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party from the total. The partygoers ate 1.5 dozens of brownies which translates to 18 individual units.\n\n4. The remaining number of brownies are those left over from the day. \n\nPlease note that the strawberries aren't relevant to this question. They seem to be included for added detail about the type of brownies, but they don't impact the overall count of the brownies. I will also assume that all the brownies eaten during the party were from those brought by Greta's friends since it was not explicitly mentioned that anyone ate Greta's personal batch or her office brownies."
