Calculate the total cost of the ballpens: Since he bought only one, the cost is already given as $0.5\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the pencil case: It is said to cost twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens. So calculate the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens then multiply this by 2.\n\n4. Finally, calculate the total amount William spent: Add the total cost of notebooks, ballpens, and the pencil case. This result is the amount William spent in all."
