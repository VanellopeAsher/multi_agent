Calculate the Thursday working hours, which are 2 hours less than Wednesday's hours: 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours.\n4.

Based on the information provided, he calculated that Bruce worked for 5 hours on Tuesday, 10 hours on Wednesday (double Tuesday's hours), and 8 hours on Thursday (2 hours less than Wednesday). By adding these hours together, he concluded that Bruce worked a total of 23 hours over the three days.\n\nAgent_Code_Executor followed a similar approach. He defined the number of hours worked on Tuesday as `tuesday_hours = 5`, computed Wednesday's hours as `wednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours`, and calculated Thursday's hours as `thursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2`. Summing these values, he arrived at a total of 23 hours (`total_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours`). When he ran the code, the output correctly displayed `23`.\n\nBased on the logical breakdown of the problem and the correct execution of the code, I am confident in verifying the solution. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{23}**"
