      "content": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of preparing one jar of this blend by adding the costs of all ingredients:\n   - Multiply the cost per pound of each ingredient by the quantity needed for one jar, and then sum these values.\n2. Subtract the cost of one jar from the selling price to find the profit from selling one jar.\n3. Multiply the profit from one jar by the number of jars sold to find the total profit.\n\nLet's proceed with these calculations:\n\nStep 1:\n\n- Cost of passion fruit for one jar: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12\n- Cost of jackfruit for one jar: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12\n- Cost of special honey for one jar: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20\n\nThe total cost of one jar is therefore $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44.\n\nStep 2:\n\nThe profit from selling one jar is the selling price minus the cost, which is $50 - $44 = $6.\n\nStep 3:\n\nThe total profit from selling 10 jars is 10 jars * $6/jar = $60. \n\nSo, Tim earns a profit of $60 from selling 10 jars of this blend."
