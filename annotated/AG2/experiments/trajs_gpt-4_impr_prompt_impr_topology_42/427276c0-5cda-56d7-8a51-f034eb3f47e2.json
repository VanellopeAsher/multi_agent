Then, divide this total by the number of women at the party.\n\nSteps to follow:\n1. Multiply the height of the first type of heel (4.5 inches) by the number of women wearing this type of heel (3 women). This gives 4.5 * 3 = 13.5 inches.\n2. Multiply the height of the second type of heel (2.5 inches) by the number of women wearing this type of heel (3 women). This gives 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 inches.\n3. Add the total height of the first type of heels to the total height of the second type of heels. This gives 13.5 + 7.5 = 21 inches.\n4. Divide this total height (21 inches) by the total number of women (6 women). This gives 21 / 6 = 3.5 inches. \n\nThe average height of heels at the party is 3.5 inches."
