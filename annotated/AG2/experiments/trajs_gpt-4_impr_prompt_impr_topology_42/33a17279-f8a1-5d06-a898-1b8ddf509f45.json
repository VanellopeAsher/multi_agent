Calculate total earnings from selling cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 = $240\n3. Sum up total earnings: $80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320\n4. Subtract the money given to Suzanne's sisters: $320 - $10 (for the first sister) - $10 (for the second sister) = $300\n5. Subtract the money donated to charity: $300 - $15 = $285\n\nHence, Suzanne should have $285 left from her earnings."
