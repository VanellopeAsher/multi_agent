We know that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs. There are two twins, so they found a total of 2 * 30 = 60 eggs.\n2. We also know that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. Here, we are not given the total number of eggs. We can infer from the problem that the \"all the other eggs\" includes the ones found by friends, plus the 10 unfound eggs.\n3. The number of eggs found by the friends is therefore \"all the other eggs\" minus the 10 unfound eggs and minus the 60 eggs found by the Smith twins.\n\nThis is the information we have, I believe Agent_Code_Executor can now help us code this solution in python."
