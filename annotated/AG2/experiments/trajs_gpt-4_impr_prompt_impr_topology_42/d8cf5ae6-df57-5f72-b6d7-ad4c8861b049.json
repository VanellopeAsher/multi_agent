  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the horse feed. \n\n1. He buys:\n    - Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes. Therefore the total weight of the sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.\n    - Four 12-pound bags of carrots. Therefore the total weight of the carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.\n    - Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay. Therefore the total weight of the hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.\n    - Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats. Therefore the total weight of the oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.\n\n2. After determining the weight of each type of feed, we add them all together to find the total weight of the feed:\n    Total weight = weight of sugar cubes + weight of carrots + weight of hay + weight of oats\n                          = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.\n\n3. The final step is to determine how many pounds the farmer's truck can carry at a time. Since we know that he needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed, we can find the truck's capacity by dividing the total weight of the feed by the number of trips:\n    Truck capacity = total weight / number of trips\n                              = 4500 / 2 = 2250 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time."
