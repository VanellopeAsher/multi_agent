The aquarium cost her $10.00.\n2) Second, measure the total cost she spent at the pet store. To do this:\n    * Two bags of rocks that cost $2.50 each would amount to 2*$2.50 = $5.00.\n    * Additionally, three pieces of coral that cost $2.00 each would cost her 3*$2.00 = $6.00.\n    * Taking into account the 20 fish she bought, let's clarify the cost of each fish before we can add it to our calculation.\n    * Finally, she bought fish food which cost her $2.00.\n3) Therefore, the total cost of items bought from the pet store would be the sum of the amounts they each cost.\n4) Finally, to get the total amount spent, we add the cost from the yard sale (aquarium) and the total cost from the pet store.\n\nLet's discuss the cost of each fish before we can proceed to calculate the total amount spent."
