Deduct the sum obtained in step 1 from the total amount Marie paid. \n3. The result from step 2 is the total cost of the pizzas. \n4. Finally, divide the cost of the pizzas by the cost of one box to find out the number of boxes Marie ordered. \n\nLet's do the calculations now. \n\n1. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3.5 = $17.5, and 4 apples cost 4 * $1.5 = $6. The total for these items is $12 + $17.5 + $6 = $35.5. \n2. We deduct this amount from the total Marie paid, which is $52.5 - $35.5 = $17.\n3. So, Marie spent $17 on pizza. \n4. If each box of pizza costs $8.5, then Marie ordered $17 / $8.5 = 2 boxes of pizza. \n\nSo, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
