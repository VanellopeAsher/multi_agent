Initially, Ali has $32 after buying dinner which was 3/5 of the remaining money after giving half to his sister. To find the full amount he had after giving his sister half of the money, we need to reverse the fraction. If 3/5 equals to $32, then 1 equals to ($32 / 3)*5, so multiply $32 by 5/3.\n2. The result of the first operation gives the money Ali was left with after giving his sister half of the original amount. To find the total amount Ali initially had, we multiply the amount he had after paying his sister by 2.\n3. The total amount is constituted by some $10 bills and six $20 bills. Subtract the total value of the $20 bills from the total to determine the value of the $10 bills.\n4. To find the number of $10 bills Ali had, divide the value of the $10 bills by 10. This should be the answer to the question. \n\nPlease note : If at any step we get a non-integer result, conclude that the problem doesn't have a valid answer because we know that bill denominations are always whole numbers."

To summarize:\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Ali was left with $32 after spending 3/5 of the money he had remaining after giving half of his initial money to his sister. \n\nWe then reverse this process to find the original total. First, we find the total he was left with after giving money to his sister by dividing $32 by 3 and then multiplying by 5. Then, we find the initial total by multiplying this result by 2. \n\nThe original money is made up of $10 bills and six $20 bills. Therefore, subtracting the total value of the $20 bills from the initial total gives us the sum of the $10 bills. Finally, we divide this sum by $10 to get the number of $10 bills, which is 13. \n\nHence, Ali initially had 13 ten dollar bills."

Then, the sum of money from the twenty-dollar bills was subtracted from this initial total to find out the value of all of Ali's ten-dollar bills before he started giving money away or spending it.\n\nSo, Ali initially had 13 ten-dollar bills."
