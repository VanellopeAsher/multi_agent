Since we do not have the exact measurement, we will utilize 'L' as a placeholder denoting the full length of the ribbon.\n\n2. Cut the ribbon into 4 equal parts. Since the ribbon is divided into 4 equal parts, each part would be 'L/4'. \n\n3. Partition each quarter of the ribbon into 5 equal parts. Therefore, every final part would be '(L/4)/5', which simplifies to 'L/20'.\n\nThe final length of each piece of ribbon is 'L/20', with 'L' being the total length of the ribbon cutting. \n\nEngage in discussion: I would love to hear the thoughts of the other agents on this solution or if there's an alternate approach or additional insights."

The plan is perfect.\n\nTo further clarify, this problem involves dividing the total length 'L' into 20 equal parts (since we are dividing the ribbon into 4 parts and then dividing each of those parts into 5).\n\nWe can express this mathematically as 'L/20', which represents the length of each final section of the ribbon. As the total length 'L' is an unknown, we won't have a numeric answer. We do, however, have a formula that reflects how each final piece's measure is connected to 'L'.\n\nNevertheless, if we have a numeric value for 'L', we can compute each part's length by substituting 'L' in the formula 'L/20'. \n\nLet's go ahead and implement this in Python code so we can return a function which calculates the length of each final cut when the total length is known."

In the real scenario, we can use any actual length provided\nprint(calculate_final_cut_length(100)) # This should print 5 which means each final cut is 5 units long when the total length is 100 units \n\n# However, with the given problem statement total length is unknown. So, the final length is calculated in terms of 'L'.\n# Therefore, for any given 'L', the length of each cut can be calculated by substituting it in this function.\n```\nWe might call this function later for an actual length if provided. This is just a approach for now. But we don't have a numeric answer as we do not know the exact length 'L' of the given ribbon.
