These are her student loans ($300/month), her credit card ($200/month), and her mortgage ($500/month). \n\nAfter this, Jessica's plan is to pay 50% more on top of this minimum debt repayment amount. We need to calculate this additional 50%. \n\nWe also need to factor in Jessica's monthly gym and Netflix bills. Since she is using a coupon to pay for the Netflix subscription, she effectively isn't paying anything for it. \n\nAfter calculating these monthly amounts, we multiply by 12 to gain the total annual expenditure. \n\nLet's detail out the steps using more specific numbers:\n\nStep 1. Calculate the total minimum payment \n= 300 (Student Loan) + 200 (Credit Card) + 500 (Mortgage) \n\nStep 2. Calculate the 50% increase over the total payment \n= Total Payment * 0.5 \n\nStep 3. Add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment \n= Total Minimum Payment + Extra 50% \n\nStep 4. Work out Jessica's monthly expenditure\n= Total Monthly Debt Repayment + Gym and Netflix bills \n\nStep 5. Calculate Jessica's annual spending \n= Monthly Expenditure * 12"
