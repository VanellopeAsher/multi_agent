We're told he gained 5 pounds per month for 2 months, so multiply 5 pounds/month by 2 months.\n3. His final weight after recovery was 70 pounds. To know his weight before he started losing, we will add the total weight loss and recovery gain to his final weight. \n\nThe sum of these calculations will give us Mark's initial weight."
