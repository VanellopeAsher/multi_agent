Carver's age (45) is equal to twice the age of his daughter minus 5, or 2d - 5. We can write this as: 2d - 5 = 45.\n2. The age of Carver's daughter is equal to three times the age of his son plus 4, or 3s+4. We can write this as: d = 3s + 4.\n\nWe can now solve these two equations to find the age of the son. Let's start with the first equation:\n2d = 45+5\n2d = 50\nd = 50/2\nd = 25\n\nNow we substitute d = 25 into the second equation:\n25 = 3s + 4\n3s = 25 - 4\n3s = 21\ns = 21/3\ns = 7\n\nTherefore, Carver's son is 7 years old."
