Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is the total number of cars minus the number of automatic and manual cars, that is, 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of currently available cars. We know that 3 automatic cars and 2 manual cars are not available. Therefore, the total number of currently available cars is the total number of cars minus the number of unavailable cars, that is, 20 - 3 - 2 = 15 cars.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars from the available cars. If there are 4 semi-automatic cars out of the 15 available cars, using the formula (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total available cars) * 100, we can find the required percentage."
