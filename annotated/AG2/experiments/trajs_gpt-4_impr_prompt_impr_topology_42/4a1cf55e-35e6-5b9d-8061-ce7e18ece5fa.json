And the price of a gallon jar is provided as $5.5. So we subtract $2.5 from $5.5 to find out the cost of a half-gallon jar.\n \n2. Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallons jars, which would simply be the cost of a gallon jar multiplied by 10.\n  \n3. Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars, which would be the cost of a half-gallon jar multiplied by 16.\n  \n4. Finally, we add both totals to find out how much Cecelia spent altogether. \n\nI'll now proceed to calculate."

A gallon jar costs $5.5, and the half-gallon jar costs $2.5 less. So, according to the problem solver, the half-gallon jar costs $5.5 - $2.5 = $3.\n2. The total cost for 10-gallon jars would be $5.5 * 10 = $55.\n3. The total cost for 16 half-gallon jars would be $3 * 16 = $48.\n4. So, the total amount she spent should be $55 + $48 = $103.\n\nAgent Code Executor executed the above steps in Python and came up with an output of $103 as the total amount spent, which matches Agent Problem Solver's explanation.\n\nOn evaluating these solutions, it is clear that both the calculations are correct and they both match each other. The total cost spent by Cecelia on ten gallon jars and sixteen half-gallon jars is $103.\n\nHence, **SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{103}."
