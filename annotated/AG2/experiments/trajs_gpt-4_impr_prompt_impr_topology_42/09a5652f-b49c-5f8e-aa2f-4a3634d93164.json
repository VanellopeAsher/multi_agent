We know John runs 60 miles in a week.

However, in reality, runners often vary their pace during a run. For a more accurate measure of John's speed, we would need information on how his pace varies during each running session. \n\nGreat work everyone.

According to the problem, John runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. That means he runs 1.5 hours each on the remaining two days. Therefore, the total time that John runs in a week is 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.\n\nHowever, the statement provided by Agent Code Executor calculated the total running time as 3 * 3 = 9 hours, which doesn't align with the problem statement. This incorrect calculation led to an incorrect speed value of 6.67 miles per hour.\n\nThe correct speed value should be calculated based on a total running time of 6 hours, not 9 hours. So let's fix this calculation:\n\nJohn's running speed = Total distance / Total running time = 60 miles / 6 hours."
