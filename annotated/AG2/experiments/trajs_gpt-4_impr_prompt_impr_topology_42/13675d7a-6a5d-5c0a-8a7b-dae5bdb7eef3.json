Calculate the number of wheels used for the cars by multiplying the number of cars (57) by the number of wheels used per car (4).\n2. Calculate the number of wheels used for the motorcycles by multiplying the number of motorcycles (73) by the number of wheels used per motorcycle (2).\n3. Add the number of wheels used for the cars and motorcycles to get the total number of wheels used.\n4. Since there are 276 wheels left in the box after Henry assembles all the toys, we calculate the number of wheels that were in the box initially by adding the number of wheels used and the number of wheels left.\n\nThis is a straight forward algebraic calculation. The formula to calculate the initial quantity of wheels is: \n\n       Initial quantity of wheels = (Number of Cars * 4) + (Number of Motorcycles * 2) + Wheels Left"
