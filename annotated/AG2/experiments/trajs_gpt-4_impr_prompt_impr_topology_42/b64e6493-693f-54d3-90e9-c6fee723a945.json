      "content": "To solve this problem, we firstly need to convert all the coins Colby has to nickels because the price of the gumballs are given in nickels. This can be done by knowing that: \n1 quarter = 5 nickels\n1 dime = 2 nickels \n1 nickel = 1 nickel\n1 penny = 0.2 nickels \n\nAfter converting the total amount Colby has to nickels, that will give us the total number of gumballs Colby can buy since each gumball costs 1 nickel. \n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Convert the total quarters to nickels: 80 quarters * 5 = 400 nickels\n2. Convert the total dimes to nickels: 60 dimes * 2 = 120 nickels\n3. Convert the total pennies to nickels: 150 pennies * 0.2 = 30 nickels\n4. Sum up all the nickels: 400 nickels (from quarters) + 120 nickels (from dimes) + 140 nickels + 30 nickels (from pennies) = 690 nickels\n5. Hence, Colby can buy 690 gumballs because each gumball costs 1 nickel. \n\nPlease confirm my findings with a calculation."
