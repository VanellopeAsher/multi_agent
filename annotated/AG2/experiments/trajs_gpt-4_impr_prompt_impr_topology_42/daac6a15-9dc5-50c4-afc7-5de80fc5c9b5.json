This measure is Derrick's daily earnings. \n  \nSo, daily earnings = Number of doughnuts * Cost of each doughnut = 150 * 2 = $300/day.\n\n**Step 2:** Multiply Derrick's daily profits by the number of days in June to find his total June earnings. \n\nSo, Derrick's total earnings for June = Daily earnings * Number of days in June = $300/day * 30 days = $9000. \n\nTherefore, if Derrick sells all his doughnuts every day in June, he would earn $9000 in that month."
