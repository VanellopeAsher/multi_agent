She collected 30 from the tallest trees, half this number (15) from the shortest trees, and 350 from the average trees.\n\n2. Understand that Joanne's sister collected twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne did. So she gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.\n\n3. Calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees. We know the sisters together gathered 500 apples. The number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees can be found by subtracting the number of apples Joanne gathered and the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the tallest trees from the total number of apples gathered by both sisters.\n\n4. To find out how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees, divide the number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister from the shortest trees by the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the shortest trees."
