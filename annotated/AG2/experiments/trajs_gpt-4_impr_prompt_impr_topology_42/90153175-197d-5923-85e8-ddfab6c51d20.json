Calculate the number of eggs she eats in a week:\n    Claire eats a 3 egg omelet every morning. So, the number of eggs she eats in a week is `3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week`.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 12 weeks:\n   The total eggs she eats in 12 weeks would be `21 eggs/week * 12 weeks = 252 eggs`.\n\n3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:\n  Since one dozen is equal to 12, the total number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 12 weeks would be `252 eggs / 12 = 21 dozens`.\n\nTherefore, Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks."

Determine the number of eggs consumed in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week and Claire consumes 3 eggs every day, she consumes a total of 7 * 3 = 21 eggs in a week.\n\n2. To find out how many eggs she consumes in 12 weeks, we multiply the weekly consumption by 12. This results in 21 * 12 = 252 eggs.\n\n3. Because a dozen contains 12 eggs, we can calculate how many dozens of eggs Claire consumes by dividing the total number of eggs by 12. This yields 252 / 12 = 21 dozens.\n\nTherefore, Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks."

Both suggested the following solution steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire consumes in a week: Claire eats 3 eggs a day, which totals to 21 eggs a week (3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week).\n2. Find the total eggs Claire consumes in 12 weeks: This is equivalent to 252 eggs (21 eggs/week * 12 weeks = 252 eggs).\n3. Translate the total number of eggs into dozens. Since one dozen equals 12, the total dozens of eggs Claire consumes in 12 weeks is 21 dozens (252 eggs / 12 = 21 dozens).  \n\nGiven those calculations, Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks. The solutions are consistent with the problem statement. \n\nTherefore, I can conclude,  \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** = \\boxed{21} Dozens of eggs."
