The problem-solving process was well executed and the final solution was accurately verified. \n\nLet me summarize:\n\nOn a weekend, Jill and her friends watch 4 films on Saturday and half as many on Sunday, which is 2.

Given that this routine continues for a total of 4 weeks, the number of films watched in this time would be the product of the number of films watched per weekend and the number of weeks.
