For the news website: They publish an average of 20 articles daily. Therefore, the total number of articles they published in February is 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.\n\n2. For the sister company: They publish an average of 10 articles daily. Therefore, the total number of articles they published in February is 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.\n\nFinally, let's add the total number of articles published by both the website and its sister company to get the total number of articles they published together in February, which is 560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles."
