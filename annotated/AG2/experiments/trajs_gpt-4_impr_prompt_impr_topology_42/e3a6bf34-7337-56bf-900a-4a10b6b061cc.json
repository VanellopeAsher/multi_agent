Calculate the total spent on red and blue ties: we know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. However, we don't have the number of ties or their individual costs. We, therefore, can't find the total amount spent on this segment.\n\n2. Calculate the total spent on green and yellow ties: we know that John spent $300 on yellow ties that cost $30 each. We also know that the cost of green ties is 70% more than that of yellow ties.\n\nHere are the steps to find the total:\n\n  Step 1: Calculate the number of yellow ties John bought: divide the total amount spent on yellow ties by the cost of one yellow tie.\n  \n  Step 2: Find out the cost of green ties: increase the cost of yellow ties by 70%.\n  \n  Step 3: Assume John bought the same quantity of green ties as yellow ties, then calculate the total amount spent on green ties by multiplying the cost by the quantity.\n\n  Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent on all ties by adding up the amount spent on yellow ties and green ties.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't compute the amount spent on red and blue ties because of insufficient information. This means that the total calculated will only be for green and yellow ties."

First, we determine the number of yellow ties purchased by dividing the total cost ($300) by the price of each yellow tie ($30).\n\n2. Then, we calculate the price of green ties by increasing the price of yellow ones by 70%. \n\n3. We assume that John purchased as many green ties as he did yellow ties. Therefore, we can calculate the total spent on green ties by multiplying the price we just obtained by the number of ties.\n\n4. Finally, we compute the total amount John spent on ties by adding the money spent on yellow ties ($300) and the money spent on green ties.\n\nUnfortunately, without the prices and quantity of red and blue ties, we cannot compute the total expenditure on these ties."
