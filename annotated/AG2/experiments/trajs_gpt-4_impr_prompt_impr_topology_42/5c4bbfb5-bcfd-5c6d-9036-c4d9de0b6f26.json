      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each item, sum these costs, and then subtract this total cost from Kelly's total budget. Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Determine the cost of the bacon packets: The total cost for 5 packs of bacon is given as $10.5.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of a single pack of bacon: This would be $10.5 divided by 5.\n\n3. Calculate the cost for a packet of chicken: We are told that the cost of each chicken pack is twice the cost of a single bacon pack.\n\n4. Determine the total cost of the chicken: This would be the cost of one pack of chicken times 6 (since there are 6 packs).\n\n5. Determine the total cost for the packs of strawberries: This is the price of a strawberry pack ($4.5) multiplied by the number of packs (3).\n\n6. Determine the cost for a pack of apples: We're told that the price of an apple pack is half the price of a strawberry pack.\n\n7. Calculate the total cost of the apple packs: This is the price of an apple pack multiplied by the number of packs (7).\n\n8. Calculate the sum of the total cost of each item: Add up the total cost for the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples.\n\n9. Determine Kelly's remaining budget: Subtract the total cost from Kelly's total budget ($65). This amount will be how much money she has left in her budget."
