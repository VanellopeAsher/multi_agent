      "content": "Here's how you can solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms. Since 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of proteins, 300 grams (which is twice as much as 150 grams) will contain twice as much protein as 150 grams of mushrooms. \n\nStep 2: Multiply the amount of protein John gets per day by 7 to determine how much protein he gets per week.\n\nThe detailed calculation is as follows:\n\nStep 1: 4 grams of proteins in 150 grams of mushrooms mean there would be 4*2 = 8 grams of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms.\nStep 2: If he eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, in 7 days (1 week), he will have consumed 8*7 = 56 grams of protein.\n\nSo, John gets 56 grams of protein from mushrooms per week.\nNow, let's discuss this with other agents."

They first calculated the amount of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms, since we know 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein. They then determined the amount of protein consumed on a weekly basis by multiplying the daily intake by 7 (days in a week).\nThe Python code executed by Agent Code Executor also returned 56, which matches the numerical solution proposed by Agent Problem Solver. Therefore, I confirm that the amount of protein John gets from mushrooms over a week is 56 grams. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{56}** grams of protein per week"
