If 6 unicorns represent two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland, we apply the proportion: if 2/3 equals 6, then 1 (or full amount) equals?\n\nStep 2: The obtained number is the total number of Scottish unicorns.\n\nStep 3: Determine the total number of unicorns worldwide. If the total number of Scottish unicorns represent a third of all the unicorns in the world, we again use the proportion. If 1/3 equals the total number of Scottish unicorns, then 1 (or full amount) equals?\n\nStep 4: The obtained number will be the number total of unicorns worldwide.\n\nTo find out the number of unicorns outside of Scotland, subtract the total number of unicorns in Scotland from the total number of unicorns worldwide. \n\nLet's calculate. If two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female, and there are 6 female unicorns, then two-thirds can be represented by the number 6. Therefore, 1/3 is represented by the number 3 (since 3*2=6). The total number of unicorns in Scotland is then 3*3=9. If these 9 unicorns are one-third of the total unicorns worldwide, then the total number of unicorns worldwide is 3*9=27. To find the number of unicorns outside of Scotland, subtract the total number of unicorns in Scotland from the total number of unicorns worldwide, 27-9=18 unicorns.\n\nThus, based on this problem setup, there are 18 unicorns outside of Scotland."

We are given that this number is 6.\n\nStep 2: Knowing that the number of female unicorns in Scotland represents two-thirds of the total number of unicorns in Scotland, calculate the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n\nStep 3: If the total number of unicorns in Scotland represents a third of the total number of unicorns in the world, determine the total number of unicorns in the world using proportional logic.\n\nStep 4: Finally, subtract the number of unicorns in Scotland from the total number of unicorns to get the number of unicorns outside Scotland.\n\nHere is the snippet of the Python code. \n\n```python\n# Number of female unicorns in Scotland\nscotland_female_unicorns = 6  # Step 1\n\n# Total number of unicorns in Scotland\nscotland_total_unicorns = (scotland_female_unicorns * 3) // 2  # Step 2\n\n# Total number of unicorns in the world\nworld_total_unicorns = scotland_total_unicorns * 3  # Step 3\n\n# Number of unicorns outside Scotland\noutside_scotland_unicorns = world_total_unicorns - scotland_total_unicorns # Step 4\n\nprint(outside_scotland_unicorns)  # It will print: 18\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we'll find that the total number of unicorns outside Scotland is 18. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
