That means Katarina has 6.8 * 10 = 68 cookies.\n- Because Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.\n- Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, the Cookie Monster has (73 - 10) / 1.2 = 52.5 cookies.\n- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of cookies they have.\n\n- The total number of cookies is 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 52.5 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 289.5 cookies.\n\nPlease note that due to the wording of the problem it is possible to have fractional cookies."

Both arrived at the conclusion that the total number of cookies is 289.5. \n\nDespite the oddity of having half a cookie in the answer (as real cookies cannot be necessarily represented in fractions), mathematically this result is correct based on the given problem's constraints.\n\nTherefore, the final agreed solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{289.5}** cookies."
