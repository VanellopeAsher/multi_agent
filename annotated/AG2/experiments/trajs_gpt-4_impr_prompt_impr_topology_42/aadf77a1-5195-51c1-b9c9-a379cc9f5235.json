For the medium t-shirts, we multiply the number of medium t-shirts by the area of a medium t-shirt. For the large t-shirts, we do the same. \n\n2. Then we subtract the total area of the medium and large t-shirts from the total area of the quilt to find the area of the small t-shirts used in the quilt.\n\n3. Finally, we divide this area by the area of a small t-shirt to find the number of small t-shirts used. \n\nWe need to round the result to the nearest whole number, as we cannot have a fraction of a t-shirt. Let's assume Octavia used entire small t-shirts, they are not cut or divided."

Let's find out how many small shirts are used in the quilt according to the steps mentioned above.\nFirst, define the total area of the quilt (in square feet), the number of medium and large shirts used, and the area of each shirt type (small, medium, large). Then, calculate the total area of medium and large shirts used. Deduct this total area from the quilt's total area, resulting in the area taken by small shirts. At last, determine the number of small shirts by dividing the small shirts' total area by the area of one small shirt. \n\n```python\n# total area of the quilt in square feet\ntotal_quilt_area = 101\n\n# number of medium and large shirts used\nnum_medium_shirts = 8\nnum_large_shirts = 6\n\n# area of each type of shirt in square feet\nsmall_shirt_area = 3\nmedium_shirt_area = 4\nlarge_shirt_area = 6\n\n# total area of medium and large shirts used\ntotal_medium_large_area = (num_medium_shirts * medium_shirt_area) + (num_large_shirts * large_shirt_area)\n\n# total area of small shirts used\ntotal_small_shirt_area = total_quilt_area - total_medium_large_area\n\n# number of small shirts used\nnum_small_shirts = total_small_shirt_area // small_shirt_area\n\nprint(num_small_shirts)\n``` \n\nNote that we use integer division (//) because we assume only whole t-shirts are used.
