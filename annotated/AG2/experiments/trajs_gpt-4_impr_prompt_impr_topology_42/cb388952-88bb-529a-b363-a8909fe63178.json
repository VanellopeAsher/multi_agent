      "content": "1. The age of Carver is 45 years old.\n2. The problem states that he is 15 years less than ten times the age of his son.\n3. Let's note the age of the son as S. Then, we can express the given condition using a simple equation: \n\n                45 = 10*S - 15 \n\n4. Solving this equation will give us the son's age. Here are the steps to solve this:\n\n a) Add 15 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the subtraction on the right side:\n\n                45 + 15 = 10*S - 15 + 15,\n                That leads to:\n                60 = 10*S\n\n b) Next, divide both sides of the equation by 10 to get S:\n\n                60 / 10 = (10*S) / 10,\n                Which simplifies to:\n                S = 6\n\n5. So, Carver's son is 6 years old."
