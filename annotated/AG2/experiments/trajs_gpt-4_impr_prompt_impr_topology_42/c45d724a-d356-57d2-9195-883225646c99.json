First, it calculated the total cost for the notebooks:\n    `total_notebook_cost = notebook_cost * number_of_notebooks = 15.00 * 50 = $750.00`\n2. Then it calculated the total cost for the ballpens:\n    `total_ballpen_cost = ballpen_cost * number_of_ballpens = 5.00 * 10 = $50.00`\n3. Finally, it added the total cost for the notebooks and the ballpens:\n    `total_spent = total_notebook_cost + total_ballpen_cost = 750.00 + 50.00 = $800.00`\n\nTherefore, William spent a total of $800.00.
