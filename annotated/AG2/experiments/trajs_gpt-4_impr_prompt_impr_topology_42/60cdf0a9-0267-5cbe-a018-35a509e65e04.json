Calculate the total number of small crayon pieces: Since each box has 64 crayons and Kate has 3 boxes, the total number of small pieces is 64 * 3 = 192 pieces.\n\n2. Determine the number of crayon muffins she can make: Given that each muffin crayon is made out of 8 small pieces, the total number of muffin crayons that she can make is 192 / 8 = 24 muffin crayons.\n\n3. Finally, you can calculate how much each muffin crayon sells for. She made a total of $36 by selling all of her muffin crayons. So using the equation (total money)/(number of muffin crayons), we find 36 / 24 = $1.5. Therefore, each muffin crayon sells for $1.5."
