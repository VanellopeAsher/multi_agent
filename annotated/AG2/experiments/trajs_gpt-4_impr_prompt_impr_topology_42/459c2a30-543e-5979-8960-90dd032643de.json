      "content": "Here are the steps to solve the task:\n\n1. Given that Brittany's comforter is quilted with 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares, calculate the number of squares for each color based on the information provided. We know from the problem that:\n    - There are 14 red squares.\n    - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14+4 = 18 blue squares.\n    - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18+6 = 24 green squares.\n\n2. Subtract the total number of red, blue, and green squares from the total square footage of the comforter to find out the number of white squares. The comforter is 68 square feet, so the number of white squares is 68 - 14 - 18 - 24 = 12.\n\n3. To find out how much fewer white squares than green squares there are, subtract the number of white squares from the number of green squares. This is 24 - 12 = 12. So, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.\n\nSo, the answer to the problem is that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares."
