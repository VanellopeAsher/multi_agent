      "content": "Step 1: Let's start by calculating the total time John spent on activities. We know that the time spent on boating and swimming and watching shows represents 30% of his total activity time, and we can calculate this total.\n\nJohn spent 6 hours boating and half of that, which is 3 hours, swimming. So that's 6 + 3 = 9 hours. \n\nHe watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's 3*2 = 6 hours.\n\nTherefore, boating, swimming and watching shows collectively took him 9 + 6 =15 hours. \n\nAccording to the problem, this time represents 30% of his total activity time. To calculate the total, we will use the formula: (time spent on known activities / percentage of total time) * 100. Which translates to (15 / 30) * 100 = 50 hours. So John spent 50 hours on activities. \n\nStep 2: To find out how much time he spent sightseeing, we know that sightseeing makes up 40% of his total activity time. To calculate this, we will use the formula: percentage of total time * total time / 100. Which translates to 40 * 50 / 100 = 20 hours. \n\nTherefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing. \n\nStep 3: Remember, these calculations don't include the breaks or lunch time. John took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each, so he rested for 5*15 = 75 minutes or 1.25 hours. He also spent 1 hour having lunch. So the total downtime was 1.25 + 1 = 2.25 hours. \n\nJohn had a total of 50 + 2.25 = 52.25 hours accounted for while on vacation, of which 20 hours were spent sightseeing. \n\nPlease note that this does not cover the full 24*7 = 168 hours that there are in a week, so the remaining time was probably spent sleeping, relaxing or engaging in other non-specified activities.\n"
