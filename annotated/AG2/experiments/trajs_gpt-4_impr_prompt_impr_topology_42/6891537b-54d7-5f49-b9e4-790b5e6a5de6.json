Find the total number of basketball and baseball cards that Miss Maria has before giving out any cards.\n2. From this total, subtract the number of cards that Jane keeps.\n3. Then, divide the remainder by the number of cards that each student receives to find out the number of students Miss Maria gives cards to.\n\nLet me break down the calculations:\n\n1. The total number of basketball cards = number of decks * number of cards per deck = 6 * 25 = 150 cards.\n2. The total number of baseball cards = number of boxes * number of cards per box = 5 * 40 = 200 cards.\n3. Therefore, the total number of cards that Miss Maria has originally = number of basketball cards + number of baseball cards = 150 + 200 = 350 cards.\n4. The total number of cards left after Jane keeps some = total number of original cards - number of cards Jane keeps = 350 - 50 = 300 cards.\n5. The number of students Miss Maria has = total number of cards left / number of cards per student = 300 / 10 = 30 students.\n\nSo, Miss Maria has 30 students if each student gets 10 cards and Jane keeps 50 cards."

Finally, the number of students that Miss Maria has = total number of cards left / number of cards per student = 300 / 10 = 30 students.\n\nHowever, the Python code returns a floating-point number. This is due to the division operation which in default returns a floating-point number in Python. Since the number of students can't be a decimal, we should convert this number into an integer. We know from the problem statement that the division is exact, so we won't be losing any information by converting to an integer.\n\nSo, the final solution is 30 students."

Similarly, we find the total number of baseball cards by multiplying the number of boxes (5) by the number of cards per box (40), yielding 200 cards in total.\n\n3. Adding these two totals together, we find that Miss Maria originally has 350 cards.\n\n4. After subtracting the 50 cards that Jane keeps, 300 cards remain.\n\n5. Dividing this by the 10 cards each student receives, we discern that Miss Maria has 30 students.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{30}**."
