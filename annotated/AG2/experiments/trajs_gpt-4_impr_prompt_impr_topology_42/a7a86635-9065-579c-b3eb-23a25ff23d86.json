Each girl collected the number of seashells equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\n\nGiven the above points, we can calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl as follow:\n\n- Number of shells brought by each boy = 600 shells\n- Number of shells brought by each girl = Number of shells brought by each boy + 4 times the number of shells brought by each boy = 600 + 4*600\n\nNow we just need to perform the calculation."
