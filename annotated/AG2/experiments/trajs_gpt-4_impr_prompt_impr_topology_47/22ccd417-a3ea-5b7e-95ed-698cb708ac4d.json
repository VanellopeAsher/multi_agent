      "content": "Let's start by understanding the information given in the problem:\n\n1. There are two kinds of medicine, let's call them medicine A and medicine B.\n2. For each dosage, Saanvi combines a certain mL of medicine A with 3 times that amount of medicine B.\n3. There is a total of 448 mL of medicine given in 8 dosages.\n4. The question is to find out how many mL of one medicine (let's assume medicine A) Saanvi combines each time.\n\nTo solve this problem, we could start by finding out the amount of medicine in one dose. Then we can calculate the amount of medicine A in this dose using what we know about the ratio of medicine A to B.\n\nHere are the steps to solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total amount of medicine given in one dose.\nStep 2: Determine the amount of medicine A in one dose. \n\nLet's clarify these steps further:\n\nStep 1: Since there is a total of 448 mL of medicine given in 8 doses, to find out the amount of medicine given in one dose, divide the total medicine by the number of doses. \n\nStep 2: We are given that for each dosage, the amount of medicine A combined with medicine B is in the ratio 1:3. This means that 1/4 of the dose is medicine A and 3/4 of the dose is medicine B. Once we know the amount of medicine in one dose, multiply it by 1/4 to know the amount of medicine A in one dose.\n\nThis solution approach does not assume that doses are of equal size, as it doesn't clarify this in the problem. However, typically, this could be a reasonable assumption to make, but if the doses vary in size, this may not be accurate."
