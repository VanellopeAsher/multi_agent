Multiply the number of each type by the square footage they each take up, and add those numbers together.\n\nStep 2: To find out how many square feet the small shirts are, subtract the total from the medium and large from the total size of the quilt.\n\nStep 3: Divide the result from step 2 by the square footage of the small shirts to find out how many were used. \n\nNow let's run these steps:\n\n1. The total square feet of the medium and large shirts is: \n\n   (8 Medium Shirts * 4 square feet) + (6 Large Shirts * 6 square feet) = 32 + 36 = 68 square feet. \n\n2. The total square feet of the small shirts is then:\n\n   101 (Total Square Feet of quilt) - 68  (Total Square Feet of medium and large shirts) = 33 square feet. \n\n3. The number of small shirts used is then:\n\n   33 (Total Square Feet of small shirts) / 3 (Square Feet per small shirt) = 11 small shirts.\n\nSo, Octavia used 11 small shirts to make the quilt."
