Calculate the amount of money Kassidy has: Given that Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Arelia, we multiply 2/3 by the amount of money Arelia has ($150) to get the money amount for Kassidy.\n\n2. Calculate the amount of money Rayna has: Rayna has $70 more than Kassidy, so we add $70 to the amount of money we calculated for Kassidy.\n\n3. Add all the money amounts together: We add the money amount for Arelia, Kassidy and Rayna. \n\n4. Finally, divide the total money amount by 3 (because they want to share the total amount equally) to get the amount of money each would have. \n\nYou are encouraged to perform these calculations to get the final answer."
