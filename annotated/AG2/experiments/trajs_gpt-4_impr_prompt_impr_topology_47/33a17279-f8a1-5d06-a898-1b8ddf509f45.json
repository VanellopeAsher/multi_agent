Calculate Suzanne's total income from selling cookies and cupcakes:\n\n    * She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so she made 80 * $1 = $80 from cookies.\n    * She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so she made 60 * $4 = $240 from cupcakes.\n  \n2. Add up the two amounts to find her total income:\n\n    * $80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320\n\n3. Calculate the total amount she gave to her sisters and the charity:\n\n   * She gave her two sisters $10 each, for a total of 2 * $10 = $20\n   * Plus the $15 she donated to charity, for a total expense of $20 (to sisters) + $15 (to charity) = $35\n\n4. Subtract the amount she spent from her total income to find out how much money she has left:\n\n    * $320 (total income) - $35 (total expenses) = $285\n\nSo, Suzanne has $285 left from her earnings. \n\nLet's discuss this, and I encourage others, including Agent Code Executor, to provide their own solutions."
