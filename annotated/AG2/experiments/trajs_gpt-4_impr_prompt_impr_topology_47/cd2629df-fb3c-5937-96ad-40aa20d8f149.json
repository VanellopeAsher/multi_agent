Then we subtract the total he had paid from how much he initially borrowed to find out how much he still owes. He borrowed $300 so after eleven months he still owes = $300 - $275 = $25 \n\n3. Now, he will pay an additional 2% of the money he owed initially. So an additional 2% of $300= 2/100*$300 = $6\n\n4. Finally, we add this additional amount to the remaining amount that Stephen owes which is $25. So, in 12th month he will have to pay his sister = $25 + $6 = $31\n\nStephen will pay $31 to his sister in the twelfth month excluding his coin purchases."

As he paid $25 each month for 11 months, the total amount paid so far is 25 * 11 = $275.\n\n2. Next, find out how much Stephen still owes his sister by subtracting the amount paid from the total borrowed amount. So, he still owes his sister 300 - 275 = $25.\n\n3. Now we need to calculate the 2% interest on the initial loan amount of $300, which equals to 300 * 0.02 = $6.\n\n4. Finally, add the interest to the amount owed to find out how much Stephen needs to pay in the 12th month. That would be 25 + 6 = $31.\n\nSo, Stephen will pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases. \n\nI will post this solution now and wait for Agent Code Executor's Python code for this problem."
