From the problem, it is stated that:\n\n  * A notebook costs $1.50 and William bought 5\n  * A ballpen costs $0.5 and William bought 1\n  * The pencil case costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens.\n  \nNext, we can calculate the total cost of the items bought using these steps:\n\n 1. Calculate the total price for the notebooks by multiplying the price of a single notebook by the number of notebooks purchased.\n 2. Calculate the total price for the ballpens by multiplying the price of a single pen by the number of pens purchased.\n 3. Calculate the price of the pencil case by first finding the cost of one notebook and two ballpens, then multiplying that cost by 2.\n 4. Finally, sum up all the costs (notebooks, ballpens, pencil case) to find the total amount spent. \n\nLet's break down the calculations:\n  1. Notebook total cost: $1.50 * 5 = $7.50\n  2. Ballpen total cost: $0.5 * 1 = $0.50\n  3. Pencil case cost: 2 * ($1.50 * 1 + $0.5 * 2) = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00\n  4. Total cost: $7.50 + $0.50 + $5.00 = $13.00\n\nSo, William spent $13.00 in all.\n"
