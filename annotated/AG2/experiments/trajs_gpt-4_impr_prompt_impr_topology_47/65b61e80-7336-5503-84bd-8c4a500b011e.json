Since they each found 30 eggs, multiply 30 by 2 to get the total number of eggs they found: `total_eggs_smith_twins = 30 * 2`.\n\n2. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we derive the total number of eggs by adding the number the Smith twins found and the remaining 10: `total_eggs = total_eggs_smith_twins + 10`.\n\n3. We then find out the number of eggs the friends found by subtracting the Smith twins' eggs from the total: `eggs_found_by_friends = total_eggs - total_eggs_smith_twins`.\n\nThe solution is the value from step 3, `eggs_found_by_friends`, which represents the number of eggs the friends found."
