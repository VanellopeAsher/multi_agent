So, the cost for each bottle of cognac is 60 + (60 * 0.5) = $90\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the total cost of the cognac bottles.\n    \n    The total cost that John spent on cognac is 20 * 90 = $1800\n\nStep 4: Find out the total cost of everything.\n    \n    This is the sum of the cost of all the scotch and cognac bottles.
