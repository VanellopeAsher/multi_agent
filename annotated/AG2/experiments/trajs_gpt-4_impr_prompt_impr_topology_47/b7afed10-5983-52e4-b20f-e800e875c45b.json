When we take these three days together, we find that Sam ran 10.5 miles (3.5 miles x 3).\n\n2. On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5.5 miles each day. This sums up to 11 miles (5.5 miles x 2).\n\n3. Now, to find the total miles run in the week, we add the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday. \n\n4. This gives us 21.5 miles (10.5 miles + 11 miles) in total for the week. \n\nSo, Sam ran 21.5 miles during the week."
