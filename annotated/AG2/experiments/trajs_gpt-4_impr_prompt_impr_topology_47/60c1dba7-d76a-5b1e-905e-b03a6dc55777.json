We can create an equation that sums all the cards and set it equal to 447. So:\n\nx + 4x + 4x + 15 = 447\n\nSTEP 4:\nSolve the equation for x to ascertain the number of cards each person has:\n\n9x + 15 = 447\n9x = 447 - 15\n9x = 432\nx = 432 / 9\nx = 48\n\nThis means PJ has 48 cards.\n\nSTEP 5:\nSubstitute the value of x (48) into the equations for Smendrick and Becca:\n\nSmendrick's cards: 4x = 4 * 48 = 192\nBecca's cards: 4x + 15 = 4 * 48 + 15 = 207\n\nThus, Becca has 207 cards.
