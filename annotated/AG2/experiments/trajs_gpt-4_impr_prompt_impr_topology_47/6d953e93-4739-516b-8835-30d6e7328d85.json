      "content": "Sure, let's break this problem down:\n\n1. Calculate the total sum the mechanic earns on Thursday:\n   The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires on Thursday. Given that he charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire, we first calculate the total earning for truck tires which is 6 tires * $60/tire = $360. Then we calculate the total earning for car tires which is 4 tires * $40/tire = $160. So total earning on thursday is $360 (for truck tires) + $160 (for car tires) = $520.\n\n2. Now, we know that the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. This means that the earning on Friday is $520 (Thursday's earning) - $40 = $480.\n\n3. On Friday, the mechanic only repairs car tires and charges $40 for each. Therefore, the number of car tires that he repairs on Friday would be his earnings on Friday divided by the charge per car tire. This means number of car tires = $480 (Friday's earning) / $40 (per car tire) = 12 car tires.\n\nSo, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday."
