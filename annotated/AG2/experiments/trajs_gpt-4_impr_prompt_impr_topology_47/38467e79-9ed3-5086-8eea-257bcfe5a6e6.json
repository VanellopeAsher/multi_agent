This is because two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer, leaving one-third who don't. \n\nSince we know that 30 students don't have a desktop computer, these students represent the one-third. So to find the total number of students, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Recognize that 30 students represent 1/3 of the total.\n2. Multiply this number (30) by 3 to find the total number of students. \n\nThis can be represented by the equation:\n\n`total_students = 3 * students_without_desktop` \n\nWith `students_without_desktop = 30`, the solution can be found by substituting the value into the equation."
