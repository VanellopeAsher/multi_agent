To do this, add the time spent boating to half of this time (the time spent swimming): total time = boating time + half of boating time.\n2. Also, find out the total time spent watching shows. As each show was 2 hours long and he watched 3 shows, this total time will be 2 hours/show x 3 shows.\n3. Add the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows together to get the total time spent on these activities.\n4. From the problem, we know that the time spent on these activities was 30% of the total time spent. So, we can find the total time by dividing the time spent on these activities by 30% (0.30).\n5. John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. To find out how long this was, we can multiply the total time (as derived above) by 40% (0.40).\n6. The time spent sightseeing will be given in hours."
