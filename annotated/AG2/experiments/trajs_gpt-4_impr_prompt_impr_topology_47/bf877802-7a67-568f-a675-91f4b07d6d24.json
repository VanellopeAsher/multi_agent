The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees an hour for the first 10 hours. So, the total increase in angle will be 5 degrees/hour x 10 hours = 50 degrees.\n\n3. Therefore, after 10 hours, the angle of the sun is 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.\n\n4. For the next 2 hours, the sun moves at a slower rate of 3 degrees an hour. So, the total increase in angle here will be 3 degrees/hour x 2 hours = 6 degrees.\n\n5. Finally, after these additional 2 hours, the angle of the sun is 82 degrees + 6 degrees = 88 degrees.\n\nIn conclusion, there will be an angle of 88 degrees from the ground to the sun."
