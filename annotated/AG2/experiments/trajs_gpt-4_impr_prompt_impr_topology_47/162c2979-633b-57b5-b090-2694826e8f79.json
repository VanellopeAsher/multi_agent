She also bought a pack of grape gum for $2.\n3. And a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.\n4. The total she paid for all the gum packs is the sum of the costs of strawberry gum, grape gum, and green apple gum. That is $4 (strawberry) + $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple).\n\nLet's calculate this."
