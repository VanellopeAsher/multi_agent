The calculations are correct, and there are no assumptions made outside given variables. \n\nOn Monday, the tank's depth is given as 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased, adding 7 feet to the depth of Monday, which gives 24 feet. On Wednesday, the depth became two thirds of Tuesday, which is about 16 feet, rounded to the nearest whole number. The difference between the depth on Tuesday and Wednesday is 8 feet. On Thursday, there was an increase by half of this difference, adding 4 feet to the depth of Wednesday. This brings the total depth on Thursday to 20 feet. So, the correct solution is indeed 20 feet.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 20.0"
