Calculate the cost of the wooden tables by multiplying the number of tables (40) by the cost of each table ($200). Let's call this Total Tables Cost.\n  2. Calculate the cost of the roof frames by multiplying the number of frames (20) by the cost of each frame ($100). Let's call this Total Frame Cost.\n  3.
