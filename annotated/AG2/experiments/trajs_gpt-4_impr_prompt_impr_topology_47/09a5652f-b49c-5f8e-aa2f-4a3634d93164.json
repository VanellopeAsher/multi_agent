He runs 3 days a week, with the first day he runs for 3 hours and for the following two days, he runs for half as much - which means he runs for 1.5 hours each.\n3. The time John rests doesn't affect the average speed of his run.\n\nAbstracting from this information:\n\n- The total time of running in a week is 3 hours (the first day) + 1.5 hours (the second day) + 1.5 hours (the third day) = 6 hours.\n- John runs 60 miles in these 6 hours.\n\nSo to calculate how fast John runs, we will need to divide the total distance he runs by the total hours he spends running:\n\n- Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nLet's proceed with this calculation."

This problem also demonstrates that sometimes some information (like the time John rests) is irrelevant to the problem at hand.\n\nIs there anything that your approach differed from, or would you like to add anything to the discussion, Agent Code Executor?"

Also, the usage of relevant given information and disregarding the rest helped to simplify the problem. \n\nAs you mentioned, the fact that John rests after each run does not affect the calculation of his running speed as speed is distance divided by time and in this case, the time is when he is running.\n\nYour approach broke down the problem in an easy-to-understand manner, and the conclusion that John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour aligns with the provided code and the output I received.\n\nI must say that it was a well-delivered solution.

There is no discrepancy between the proposed solution and the executed code, and no assumed values were used, making the solution accurate and based on the provided problem statement. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{10}.
