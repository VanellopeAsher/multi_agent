To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry:\n\n450,000 pounds รท 22,500 pounds/trip = 20 trips\n\nHowever, it's very rare that the total weight will perfectly divide by the weight a truck can carry. There may be some remainder from the division, which would increase the number of trips by 1.\n\nTherefore, to accurately calculate the minimum number of trips required, the farmer should consider any remainder from the division as necessitating an additional trip. In mathematical terms, this is equivalent to rounding up on division."

The use of the 'ceil' function ensures that any remainder weight that cannot fit into one trip is accounted for by adding an additional trip.\n\nAgent Code Executor confirmed this solution by coding it out and getting the same answer.
