      "content": "The problem doesn't provide enough details to determine how fast John runs. It only provides information about the total distance he runs in a week, and how he distributes his runs over the week. We would also need to know the time it takes him to run a certain distance to determine his speed.\n\nIf we wrongly interpret the question to ask for the average distance ran per day, the solution would proceed as follows:\n\n1. Determine the amount he runs for the 3 days. If he runs half as much the remaining two days, it means he covers more distance in the first three days, so let's assume he runs `X` miles each day for these three days. \n\n2. For the other 2 days, he runs half of this distance, which would be `X/2` miles.\n\n3. So, from the problem we have the formula: `3*X + 2*(X/2) = 60`, but `X` in this case gives the average distance per day and not an indication of speed. As clarified, we can't determine John's speed with the provided information. \n\nThe required data to calculate speed (which is usually referred to as 'pace' in running) would usually be in a form, such as \"it takes him `Y` hours to run `X` miles\". Without this data, it's not possible to determine how fast John runs."

However, if the information we have accurately represents the question, then the question is not asking for his speed but the average distance he covers each day. We can calculate that using Python as follows:\n\n```python\n# declare and initialize variables\ntotal_distance = 60.0\nthree_days = 3\nremaining_days = 2\n\n# calculate how much John runs per day for the first three days\ndistance_three_days = total_distance/(1+(remaining_days/three_days))\n\n# divide the distance by 3 to get the average\naverage_three_days = distance_three_days / three_days\n\n# print the average distance John runs each day for the first three days\nprint(average_three_days)\n\n# for the remaining two days\naverage_remaining_days = average_three_days / 2\n\n# print the average distance John runs each day for the remaining two days\nprint(average_remaining_days)\n```\n\nI agree if we want to calculate speed we would need the time it takes for John to run a certain distance.
