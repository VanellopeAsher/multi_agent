During his recovery, Mark regained weight for 2 months, gaining 5 pounds each month. So, Mark regained 2 months × 5 pounds/month = 10 pounds.\n3. To find his initial weight we need to take his final weight after recovery, undo the weight he regained, and then undo the weight he lost. This gets us back to his weight before he fell ill. So his initial weight was: final weight + weight lost - weight regained.\n\nNow we just need to fill in the numbers:\n\nInitial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds - 10 pounds = 90 pounds. \n\nSo, Mark initially weighed 90 pounds."
