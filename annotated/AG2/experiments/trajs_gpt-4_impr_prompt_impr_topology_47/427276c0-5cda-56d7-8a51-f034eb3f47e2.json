Do the same for the second group of heels (2.5 inches * 3).\n\n3. Add the two totals together to get the overall total height of the heels at the party.\n\n4. Divide this total by the number of women at the party (which is the sum of the women in the first and second group, 3 + 3).\n\nThrough this method, we can establish the average height of heels at the party."
