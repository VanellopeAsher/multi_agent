The number of boys is hence half the total children (100 boys).\n3. Each boy brought back 600 shells; therefore, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 100 boys times 600 shells, which equals 60000 shells.\n4. We know the girls brought what the boys brought plus four times this amount. So, the girls brought 60000 + 4*(60000) shells.\n5. Since the number of girls is equal to the number of boys (100 girls), to find out how many shells each girl brought, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls.\n\nLet's now calculate the final result."
