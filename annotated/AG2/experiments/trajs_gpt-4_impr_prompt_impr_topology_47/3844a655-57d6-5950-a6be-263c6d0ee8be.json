Thus, its cost can be represented by the equation C1 = 2000 + 50p, where p is the number of people attending. \n\n2. For the second venue, the cost is simply a per-person fee that already includes food. So, its cost can be represented by the equation C2 = 250p.\n\nAt the point where the two costs are equal:\n\n2000 + 50p = 250p\n\nThis equation is a simple linear equation and it can be solved for p (the number of guests) to find the point of equilibrium where the two venues are equal in cost. \n\nBy rearranging the equation:\n\n2000 + 50p = 250p  \n\nCan be simplified to:\n\n2000 = 200p\n\nThen:\n\np = 2000 / 200\n\nCalculate the value of p. This value represents the number of guests at which the cost of both options is the same.\n"
