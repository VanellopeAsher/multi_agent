Therefore, we multiply $10 * 3 to get $30 spent in a year.\n\nStep 2: Determine how much Pauline spends over 10 years.\nAs the ticket prices do not change during the first 10 years, we multiply $30 (which is the spend for one year) by 10 to get $300. This is the total amount Pauline spends in 10 years.\n\nStep 3: Determine the new cost of a museum visit.\nAfter 10 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. We calculate 150% of $10 (which is $15) and add it to the original cost of $10. The new cost for one museum visit becomes $25.\n\nStep 4: Determine how much Pauline spends in one year with the new ticket price.\nPauline still goes to the museum 3 times a year, but now each visit costs $25. Therefore, we multiply $25 * 3 to get $75, spent in a year with the new price.\n\nStep 5: Determine how much Pauline spends over 3 years with the new ticket price.\nWe multiply $75 (the spend for one year with the new ticket price) by 3 to get $225 which is the total amount Pauline spends in the 3 years after ticket price increases.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total amount that Pauline spends over 13 years.\nAdding the amount spent in the first 10 years ($300) to the amount spent in the subsequent 3 years ($225), Pauline spends a total of $525 on museum visits over 13 years."
