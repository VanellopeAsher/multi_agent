In this case, it would be 90 - 30 = 60.\n\nStep 2: Figure out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 55 from Richie's score, as Richie scored 55 more than Anna. This means Anna's score would be 90 - 55 = 35.\n\nStep 3: To get the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, add all their scores together. Therefore, total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals = 90 + 60 + 35. \n\nThis leads us to the solution."
