Therefore, total soccer cards = 30\n        - So, the total number of cards = basketball cards + baseball cards + soccer cards = 150 + 200 + 30 = 380\n\nStep 2: Subtract the cards she kept to get the number of cards that she gave to her students:\n        - Cards she kept = 50\n        - So, the number of cards she gave to her students = Total cards - Cards she kept = 380 - 50 = 330\n\nStep 3: Since each student gets ten cards, we divide the total number of cards given away by the number of cards each student gets to find out how many students there are:\n        - Number of students = Total cards given to students/Number of cards each student gets = 330/10 = 33\n        \nSo, Miss Maria has 33 students."
