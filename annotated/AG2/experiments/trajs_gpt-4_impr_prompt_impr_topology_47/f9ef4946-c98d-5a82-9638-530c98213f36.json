Tuesday: Again, he watches an hour-long episode, which is another 1 hour.\n3. Wednesday: He watches three 30-minute episodes. Each hour has 60 minutes. Therefore, 3*30 minutes = 90 minutes. But we need it in hours, so 90 minutes is 1.5 hours.\n4. Thursday: He watches an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. That's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n5. Friday: He watches two one-hour episodes. That's 2*1 = 2 hours.\n\nAdding up all the hours: 1 (Mon) + 1 (Tue) + 1.5 (Wed) + 1.5 (Thu) + 2 (Fri) would give us the total number of hours Frankie watched TV in total."
