Based on this, the number of unicorns left in the world outside Scotland can be calculated by subtracting the number of unicorns in Scotland from the total number of unicorns.

From here, it was established that the total number of unicorns is 27 since Scottish unicorns comprise 1/3 of this global total. The count of unicorns outside Scotland was then obtained by subtracting the Scottish count from the global count, leading to an answer of 18 unicorns outside Scotland.\n\nThe Python code provided by the Agent Code Executor essentially follows these same steps to calculate the number of unicorns outside Scotland, and subsequently verifies the solution given by Agent Problem Solver. As such, we can confidently confirm that there are 18 unicorns outside Scotland."

Based on this, it's possible to calculate the total number of unicorns in Scotland (9 unicorns). If these 9 unicorns represent one-third of all unicorns worldwide, then the total number of unicorns worldwide is 27. Therefore, the number of unicorns outside Scotland is 18 (27-9).\n\nSo, the final answer to the question \"how many unicorns are left in the world outside Scotland?\" is 18 unicorns, and this has been confirmed with Python code execution.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Chat Manager"

Therefore, there are 27 - 9 = 18 unicorns outside Scotland.\n\nAgent Code Executor's Python code aligns with this mathematical interpretation and confirms the number of unicorns outside Scotland is 18. \n\nTherefore, the final solution to this problem is 18 unicorns, as suggested by both agents.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{18}."
