So, establish the duration of his rest.\n4. Determine the remaining distance James needed to complete to cross the lake.\n5. Lastly, calculate how long it took him to swim the remaining distance at half his original speed.\n\nBy adding up the swimming and resting times, we should know how long it took him to cross the lake.
