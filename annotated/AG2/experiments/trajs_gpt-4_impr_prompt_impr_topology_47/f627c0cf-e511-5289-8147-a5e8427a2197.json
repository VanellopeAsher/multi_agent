This information is missing in the problem description, so for this solution, we'll assume he was ill for N months.\n2. Calculate the total weight loss: The total weight lost will be 10 pounds per month times the number of months (N), given by the equation `Total weight lost = 10 * N`.\n3. Calculate the initial weight: To find Mark’s initial weight, we add the total weight lost to his final weight. So, the initial weight will be the sum of the final weight and the total weight lost, given by the equation `Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost`.\n\nWithout the exact duration of illness (N), we cannot provide a numerical answer to the problem. The final equation that can be used to calculate Mark's initial weight when we know the duration of illness is `Initial weight = 70 pounds + 10 pounds/month * N months`."
