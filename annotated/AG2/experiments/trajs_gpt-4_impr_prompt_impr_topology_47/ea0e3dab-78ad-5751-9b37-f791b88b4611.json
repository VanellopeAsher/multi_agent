Calculate the total cost for the initial six months:\n   The initial charge is $200 per month. Therefore, for the first half of the year (6 months), the total amount is 6 * $200.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for the remaining six months:\n   For the other half of the year, the cost is 15% less. Hence, what Aleena pays each month is $200 - 15% of $200.\n   The total amount for the other half of the year (6 months) is 6 * ($200 - 15% of $200).\n\n3. The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is the sum of the total amounts of the first half and the second half of the year.\n\nLet's calculate these values."
