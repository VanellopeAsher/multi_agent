      "content": "STEP 1: Determine the total time spent by John\nWe know that John spent 6.6 hours boating, half that time swimming, and watched 3 shows that each lasted 2.5 hours. Therefore:\n\nTotal time spent = Time spent boating + Time spent swimming + Time spent watching shows\n\nGiven that he spent half the boating time swimming:\n\nTime spent swimming = 0.5 * Time spent boating = 0.5 * 6.6 hours = 3.3 hours\n\nAnd given that he watched 3 shows each of 2.5 hours:\n\nTime spent watching shows = Number of shows * Duration of each show = 3 shows * 2.5 hours/show = 7.5 hours\n\nSo,\n\nTotal time spent = 6.6 hours (boating) + 3.3 hours (swimming) + 7.5 hours (watching shows)\nTotal time spent = 17.4 hours\n\nSTEP 2: Find out 100% of the total time\nAccording to the problem, the time spent on the three activities accounts for 30% of the total time spent. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to solve for 100% of his time.\n\nLet T denote the total time (100%):\n\n30% of T = 17.4 hours\nT (100%) = (17.4 * 100) / 30 hours\n\nSTEP 3: Calculate the time spent sightseeing\nWe know that sightseeing represents 40% of his total time available. Therefore, after we find T from Step 2, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing as:\n\nTime spent sightseeing = 0.4 * T\n\nThe result from the above calculation will give the time John spent sightseeing. \n\nConsidering these steps, we can calculate how much time John spent sightseeing."
