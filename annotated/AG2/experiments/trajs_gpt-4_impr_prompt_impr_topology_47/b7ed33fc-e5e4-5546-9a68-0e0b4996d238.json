We need to find out how long does it take for John to solve the extreme sudoku puzzle.\n     As we know an extreme sudoku puzzle takes 3 times longer than a normal puzzle, and he can solve a normal puzzle in 30 minutes. So, the time taken by John to solve the extreme sudoku puzzle is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.\n\n2. Now, we need to calculate how many bottles of water does John consume during this period.\n     As we know John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (or 30 minutes). Given that it takes John 90 minutes, he would consume 90 / 30 = 3 bottles of water.\n\nSo, John drinks 3 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle."
