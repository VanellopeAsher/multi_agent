Start by adding up all the minimum payments:\n   - Student loan: $300\n   - Credit card: $200\n   - Mortgage: $500\n   The total comes to $1000 monthly.\n\n2. To find out how much 50% more than this minimum payment will be, simply calculate what 50% of your total is, and then add that to your original total. This will be $1000 + ($1000 * 0.50) = $1500 monthly.\n\n3. Next, you need to account for her Netflix subscription. Although she has a coupon to offset the $15 expense, the problem explicitly states she continues to pay the regular amount for her Netflix and gym, so we'll include the $15 expense for Netflix.\n\n4. Therefore, the total monthly expenditure is $1500 (debts) + $15 (Netflix) = $1515.\n\n5. To get the yearly amount, multiply this monthly total by 12.\n   - Total yearly amount = $1515 * 12\n\nLet's calculate this."
