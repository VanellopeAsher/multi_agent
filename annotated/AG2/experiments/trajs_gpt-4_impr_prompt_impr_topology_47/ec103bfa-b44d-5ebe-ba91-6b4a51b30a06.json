Calculate the total cost for the packs of milk. Since each pack of milk costs $30 and Marie ordered 5 packs, the total cost for the packs of milk would be 5 * $30 = $150.\n\n3. Calculate the total cost for the apples. Since each apple costs $1.50 and Marie ordered 40 apples, the total cost is 40 * $1.50 = $60.\n\n4. Determine the amount Marie spent on pizza. We can deduce this by subtracting the costs of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount she spent. \n\n5. Calculate the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost of a box of pizza. \n\nLet's do the computations."
