Therefore, the total initial cents Kelly has is: `5 * 25 + 2 * 10`.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost**: Kelly's expenses include a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents. The total cost is therefore: `55 + 45`.\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining cents**: Subtract the total cost from the total initial cents to find how many cents Kelly has left. \n\nSo the answer is the result of: `Total initial cents - Total Cost`. The final answer should be expressed in cents."

Both agents used only the variables provided in the problem statement and didn't make any unwarranted assumptions. The amount of money Kelly initially has is correctly computed - quarters are correctly assumed to be 25 cents each and dimes 10 cents each. The total cost of the candy bar and the can of pop is also correctly calculated as 100 cents - 55 cents for the pop and 45 cents for the candy bar. Therefore, subtracting these costs from the initial money gives the correct remaining cents. \n\nThe final solution is therefore obtained as the difference between the total initial cents from the quarters and dimes and the total cost. The agents correctly arrived at the solution following this procedure.\n\nHence, the final solution to the problem is: **SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{45}"
