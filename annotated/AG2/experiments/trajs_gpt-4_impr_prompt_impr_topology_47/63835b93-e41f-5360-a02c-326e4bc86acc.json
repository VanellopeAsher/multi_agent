The cost of the two vaccines (the price of one vaccine * 2).\n    \n    c. The cost of the broken vases (the price of one vase * 3).\n\nLet's substitute the values provided into our equation:\n\n• The cost for neutering is $150.\n• Each vaccine costs $30, and the kitten got 2 vaccines. So the total cost for vaccines is $30 * 2 = $60.\n• Each vase costs $15, and the kitten broke 3 vases. So the total cost for the broken vases is $15 * 3 = $45.\n\nAt the end, we sum all the costs:\n\nTotal cost = Cost for neutering + Cost for vaccines + Cost for broken vases\n\nThat is $150 + $60 + $45 = $255\n\nSo, the kitten has cost Leah $255 so far. Let's check this with the Agent that can execute Python code."
