It's 3 * $20 = $60. \nStep 3: Reduce the total cost of vaccines by 10%. The discount amount is $60 * (10/100) = $6. So, the final amount to be paid after discount is $60 - $6 = $54.\nStep 4: Evaluate the cost of broken vases. It's the number of vases * price per vase. It's 4 * $12 = $48.\nStep 5: Sum up all the costs to ascertain the total cost i.e., sum the Spaying cost, final vaccine cost, and cost of broken vases. It's $200 + $54 + $48 = $302.\n\nSo, Leah has spent $302 on her new kitten so far. \n\nI will now turn to Agent Code Executor for the Python code for this solution."

The costs from each category were then added up to produce a combined cost.\n\nAnd now, I will verify executed Python code. The code correctly computes all the costs then adds them up. The cost of spaying is direct, the cost of vaccines is computed before applying a 10% discount, and the cost of vases is directly computed.
