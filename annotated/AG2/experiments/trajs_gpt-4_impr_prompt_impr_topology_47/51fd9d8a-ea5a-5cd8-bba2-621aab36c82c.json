      "content": "To solve this problem, let's designate the following:\n\nLet Peter be represented by P, Paul by P_l and John by J.\n\nWe are given three equations:\n\n1. P + P_l + J = 0.1 * 1000 = 100 years\n2. P_l = 0.1 * 100 + J = 10+J years\n3. P = P_l + J\n\nOur goal is to find the value of P, which is Peter's age. We can do this step by step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Substitute equation 2 into equation 1. This gives us P + 10 + J + J = 100.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the equation from step 1. This gives us P + 2J + 10 = 100.\n\nStep 3: Rearrange the equation from step 2. This gives us P + 2J = 90.\n\nStep 4: But we know from Equation 3 that P = J + P_l = J + 10 + J. Substitute this into the equation from step 3, we have 2J + 10 + J = 90.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation from step 4. This gives us 3J + 10 = 90.\n\nStep 6: Finally, subtract 10 from both sides and divide by 3 to solve for J. This gives us J = (90 - 10) / 3 = 26.666666666666668 years.\n\nStep 7: Finally, substitute J = 26.666666666666668 into P = J + P_l to find P.\n\nThese steps should give us the value of P, which is Peter's age."
