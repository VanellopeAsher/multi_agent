Calculate how much Walter’s lawyer must have donated, since he donated three times the amount of everyone else. This means he would have given 3 * $2000 = $6000.\n3. Since we know the lawyer’s total contribution was $6600, the donation from Walter's friend would be the total lawyer's donation subtracted by the lawyer's donation based on everyone else's contribution. Which is $6600 - $6000 = $600. \n   \nHence, Walter's friend gave him $600."
