Let's say they filled up \"x\" packs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of balloons at the start:\n  - This is done by multiplying the number of packs (which we're denoting as \"x\") by the number of balloons per pack (which is given as 30). The calculation is as follows: total_balloons = x * 30\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of balloons that were thrown:\n - This is done by subtracting the number of balloons that were left at the end of the day (which is given as 12) from the total number of balloons.

Multiply the unknown number of packs (let's denote it as 'x') by the number of balloons in each pack to get the total number of balloons they started with.\n2. Then subtract the number of balloons left unused from the total, thus giving the number of balloons thrown.\n\nLet's denote these steps in the following Python code:\n\n```python\n\n# The number of balloons in each pack\nballoons_per_pack = 30\n\n# The number of balloons left unused\nballoons_left = 12\n\n# Let's denote the unknown number of packs as 'x'\n# Calculate total number of balloons they started with\ntotal_balloons = balloons_per_pack * x  # here x should be replaced with the actual number of packs\n\n# Calculate the number of balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\nWith this code, you can replace 'x' with the number of packs they filled up to find the number of balloons thrown.
