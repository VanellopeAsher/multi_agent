      "content": "Here is my solution for this problem:\n\n1. First, we should calculate Madeline's weekly expense for the dog food by converting it into a monthly expense. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, and the dog food costs $25 per week, Madeline spends $25 * 4 = $100 on dog food per month.\n\n2. Now we add up Madeline's monthly expenses for the dog. These include $100 for dog food, $20 for treats, $100 for medicine, $15 for shampoo, and $10 every two months for a toy. On average that's $10/2 = $5 per month for toys. Hence, the total monthly expense is $100 + $20 + $100 + $15 + $5 = $240.\n\n3. Finally, we convert the monthly expenses into yearly expenses by multiplying by the number of months in a year. Since there are 12 months, Madeline's yearly expenses amount to $240 * 12 = $2880.\n\nBased on these calculations, Madeline spends $2880 on her dog per year."
