Kim currently services 3 clients and he is confident enough to include 5 more potential clients in his calculations. This gives us a total of 8 clients.\n\n2. Each client's home requires 2 bottles of bleach, which cost $2 each. Kim therefore spends $2 * 2 = $4 on bleach per client.\n\n3. Since Kim services 8 clients, his total weekly expense on bleach is $4 * 8 = $32.\n\n4. Kim's total weekly income is $92 and he makes a profit of $20 each week. \n\n5. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, then Kim's total weekly expenses are $92 - $20 = $72.\n\n6. He has already spent $32 on bleach, so the remaining amount, which is $72 - $32 = $40, must be the cost for all the packs of cloths.\n\n7. Since Kim requires 1 pack of cloths per client, the cost of each pack of cloths is $40/8 = $5. \n\nSo, each pack of cloths costs $5."

      "content": "Both solutions from Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor are consistent with each other, but I need to verify their validity.\n\nHere's how each part of the problem has been addressed:\n1. Total number of clients = Existing clients + potential clients = 3 + 5 = 8\n2. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach, so the total cost for bleach per client = $2 * 2 = $4\n3. Therefore, the total weekly expense on bleach = $4 * total clients = $4 * 8 = $32\n4. Total income = $92 and profit = $20, hence total weekly expenses = Total income - profit = $92 - $20 = $72\n5. The remaining expense, that should be the total cost of the packs of cloths, is calculated by subtracting the total expenses on bleach from the total weekly expenses = $72 - $32 = $40\n6. Each client's home requires 1 pack of cloths, so the cost of each pack of cloths = total cloth expense / total clients = $40 / 8 = $5\n\nThe solution is calculated correctly by both agents, thus the cost of each pack of cloths is $5.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5}**."
