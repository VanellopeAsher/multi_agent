Therefore, we can calculate the shark's body length by the following formula:\n\n  Shark's body length = Combined length of remoras / 10%\n\nHere, we need to make sure that all measurements are in the same unit. If we assume that the length of the shark is measured in feet, we need to convert the remoras' length, which is currently in inches, into feet. There are 12 inches in one foot.\n\nLet's substitute above mentioned facts into the formula and find out the exact length of the shark."
