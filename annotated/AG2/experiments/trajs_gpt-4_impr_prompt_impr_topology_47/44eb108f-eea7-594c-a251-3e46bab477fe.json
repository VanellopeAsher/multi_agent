We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n2. Then, we divide the total length of the wire by the number of pieces to find the length of each piece. Thus, each piece is 48 inches / 8 pieces = 6 inches long."

We know that 1 foot is equivalent to 12 inches.\nThen, we need to determine the length of each piece by dividing the total length by the number of pieces.\nLet's solve this in Python.\n\n```python\n# Variables\ntotal_length_feet = 4    # The total length of the wire in feet\ntotal_pieces = 8    # The total number of pieces\n\n# Convert the length from feet to inches\ntotal_length_inches = total_length_feet * 12    # As 1 foot = 12 inches\n\n# Determine the length of each piece\npiece_length = total_length_inches / total_pieces\n\n# Print the result\nprint(piece_length)\n``` \n\nLet's execute this Python code as the next step. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
