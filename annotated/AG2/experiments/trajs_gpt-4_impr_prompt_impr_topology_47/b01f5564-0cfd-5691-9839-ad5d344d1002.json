Therefore, 300 grams of mushrooms would contain twice this amount, equal to 8 grams of protein.\n\nOnce we've calculated the daily intake of protein, we must multiply this by the number of days in a week, which is 7, to get the total grams of protein John consumes weekly.\n\nHence,\n- Find the protein in a daily diet (150 grams mushroom has 4 grams protein, so 300 grams will have 8 grams protein)\n- Calculate the weekly protein (Daily protein * 7)\n\nWriting it mathematically:\nWeekly protein = Daily protein from mushrooms * Number of days in a week.\n\nNow we just need to fill in the values and calculate."

Based on this, we can calculate how much protein there is in 300 grams.\n    - This can be done using the proportion: (150 grams / 4 grams) = (300 grams / X grams)\n    - Solving for X, we find that 300 grams of mushrooms contain 8 grams of protein.\n\n2. Calculate the weekly protein intake:\n    - Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week to get the weekly protein intake.\n    - Weekly protein intake = daily protein intake * 7\n    - Plugging the values in, we get: Weekly protein intake = 8 grams/day * 7 days/week = 56 grams/week\n\nSo, John gets 56 grams of protein from mushrooms every week.
