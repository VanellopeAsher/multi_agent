He also dumps another lego box that has 3 times the pieces of the first one, which is 500 * 3 = 1500 pieces\n3. He dumps a third lego box which has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which is 500 / 4 = 125 pieces\n4. He dumps a fourth lego box that has 125 more pieces than the first one, which is 500 + 125 = 625 pieces\n\nThe total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is therefore: 500 (first box) + 1500 (second box) + 125 (third box) + 625 (fourth box) = 2750 pieces. \n\nSo Johnny picks up a total of 2750 lego pieces. \n\nLet's now discuss this solution, and possibly have it confirmed by Agent Code Executor."

Divide the 'first_set' variable by 4 and store the result in a variable named 'third_set'.\n4. Add 125 to the 'first_set' variable and store the result in a variable named 'fourth_set'.\n5.
