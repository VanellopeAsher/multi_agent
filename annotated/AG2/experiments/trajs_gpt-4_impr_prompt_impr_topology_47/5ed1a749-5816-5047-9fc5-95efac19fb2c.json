The second box has three times as many pieces as the first box, which is 3*x.\n\n3. The third box has 1/4 the number of Lego pieces in the first box, which is x/4.\n\nSo, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up will be the sum of the pieces in the three boxes. Let's denote the total number of pieces as \"T\". Then we have:\n\nT = x +(3*x) + (x/4)\n\nSolving this equation for \"T\" will give us the total number of pieces Johnny picks up. However, we cannot solve the equation as we don't have an actual value for \"x\", as \"x\" is unknown in this problem. Once we know the number of pieces in the first box, we can substitute it into the equation to find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up."
