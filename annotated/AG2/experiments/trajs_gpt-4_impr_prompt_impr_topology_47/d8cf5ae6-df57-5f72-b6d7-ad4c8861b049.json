Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

      "content": "Let's calculate the total weight of feed the farmer needs to carry. \n\n1. First, we find the weight of the sugar cubes. He buys two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes. So, the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds. \n2. Next, we calculate the weight of the carrots. He buys four 12-pound bags of carrots. So, the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.\n3. Then we calculate the weight of the hay. He buys forty-two 75-pound bales of hay. So, the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.\n4. Lastly, we find out the weight of the oats. He buys twenty 65-pound sacks. So, the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.\n\nWe add all these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.\nThe total weight of all the feed is 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats).\n\nSince the farmer needs two trips to carry all the feed, the weight his farm truck can carry at once is the total weight divided by 2. \n\nThis solution aims to sum all weights in pounds for different types of feed the farmer purchased and to determine how much weight the farmer's truck can carry by dividing the total weight by the number of needed trips."

We first calculated the total weight of the feed that the farmer bought: 2 pounds of sugar cubes, 48 pounds of carrots, 3,150 pounds of hay, and 1,300 pounds of oats. \n2. This gave us a total weight of 4,500 pounds of feed.\n3. We then divided 4,500 pounds by 2 (since the farmer makes 2 trips) to find that the truck the farmer uses to transport the feed can carry 2,250 pounds at a time.\n\nTherefore, the farmer's truck can carry 2,250 pounds of feed per trip.
