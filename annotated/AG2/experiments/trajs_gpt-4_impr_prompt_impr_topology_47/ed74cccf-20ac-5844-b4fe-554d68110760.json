The actual total could be higher if there are more students playing soccer. The minimum total would be:\n\nMinimum total number of students = 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 22 (soccer girls) = 40\n\nSo, there are at least 40 students in total. However, if additional students are playing soccer, the total would be higher."

Agent Problem Solver added that the number of soccer players might be higher as we only know about the girls playing soccer and not if any boys are participating. Agent Code Executor confirmed the same calculation with Python code, and the output was identical.\n\nBoth agents' solutions are based on the same arguments, and there is no discrepancy between them.
