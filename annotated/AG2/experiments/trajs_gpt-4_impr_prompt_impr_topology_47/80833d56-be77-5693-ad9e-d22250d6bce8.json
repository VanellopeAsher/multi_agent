Divide the total distance by the total time spent to find the speed.\n\nStep-by-Step:\n\n1. From the problem, it's stated that he runs 10 hours the first day and half as much for the other two days. This means he runs (10 hours first day + (10/2 hours second day + 10/2 hours third day)) = 10 + (2*5) = 20 hours a week. \n\n2. Next, divide the total miles (100 miles) by total hours. speed = 100 miles/20 hours = 5 miles/hour. \n\nSo, John runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour."
