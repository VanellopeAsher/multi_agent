      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to work backwards through the steps Ali took. \n\nSteps:\n1. Start with the amount Ali had left after buying dinner, which is $32.\n2. Because the $32 is 2/5 of the money Ali had after giving his sister half, find the total amount before buying dinner by dividing $32 by (2/5). \n3. Now you have the amount Ali had after he gave his sister half. To find the original total, double this amount because it was half of the total.\n4. Finally, subtract the amount from six $20 bills from the total. The remainder is the amount from the $10 bills. Divide this amount by 10 to get the number of $10 bills.\n\nWrite this process in an equation and solve the equation to get the number of $10 bills.\n\nLet's name the number of $10 bills as x. \n\n1. Equation for dinner: 2/5 * (half total money) = $32\n2. Equation for half total money: 6$20 + 10x = half total money\n3. Combine these two equations and solve for x. \n\nUse these steps to solve the problem."
