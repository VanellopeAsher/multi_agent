Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.\n\nSTEP 3: Calculate the amount of paint used for the other colors\nThe other half of the mural is divided equally among red, white, and purple paints. The total amount of paint used for these three colors is 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints.\n\nSTEP 4: Calculate the amount of red paint used\nSince the amount of red, white, and purple paints is equal, the amount of red paint used is 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints. Therefore, 2 pints of red paint was used for the mural."

The remaining half was equally divided among red, white, and purple, and so each of these colors had an equal third of the remaining paint. In numerical terms, from the total of 12 pints, half (6 pints) was yellow, and the remainder (6 pints) was equally divided among red, white, and purple, yielding 2 pints for each.\n\nTherefore, the solution of 2 pints of red paint is correct and verified."
