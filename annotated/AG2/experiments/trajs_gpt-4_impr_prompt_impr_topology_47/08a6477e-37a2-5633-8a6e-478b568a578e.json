They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day and only used half a pack (50/2 = 25 bandages), which means they must have had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages at the beginning of the day. \n\n2. They ordered two bulk packs of bandages on the third day, so before this order, they had 103 - 2*50 = 3 bandages left from the second day.\n\n3. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than they did on the first day. Given that they had 3 bandages left at the end of the second day, we can deduce that they started the second day with 3 + 10 = 13 bandages.\n\n4. On the first day, they started with 19 bandages, and ordered one bulk pack of bandages which means they had 19 + 50 = 69 bandages in total.\n\n5. Therefore, the number of bandages they used on the first day is the difference between the starting number and the remaining number which is 69 - 13 = 56 bandages."

To find out the bandages used on day 1, we need the total number of bandages at the start of day 2, since the left over on day 2 is not used.\n- On day 3, they order 2 bulk packs and used half a pack, which means there were initially (2*50+50/2+78) = 153 bandages available on the start of the day.\n- So,the number of bandages left from day 2 was 3.
