      "content": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to understand that Marty's ribbon, when eventually cut into the finest parts, becomes numerous 5 cm long pieces.\n\n2. Given that each of the 4 initial equal parts is further divided into 5 equal parts, each original piece of ribbon becomes 4 * 5 = 20 final parts.\n\n3. As each final part measures 5 cm, the initial ribbon length can be calculated as 20 (final pieces) * 5 (length of each piece) = 100 cm. So, the total length of the ribbon that Marty has is 100 cm. \n\nThis solution is based on the given conditions of the problem statement, and assumes that there is no loss of ribbon length due to the cutting process."

Let's go ahead and implement the solution to this problem in code.\n\nFirst, let's define the final cut length of each piece.\nThen, the number of pieces each larger segment is divided into.\nLastly, the number of initial larger segments the ribbon is divided into.\n\nBy multiplying all these together, we should obtain the length of the ribbon. As explained by Agent_Problem_Solver, this is because we need to multiply all these quantities together to get a total length of the ribbon from the final cut pieces as there is no loss in length.\n \n```python\n# Defining variables\nfinal_cut_length = 5  # Each final piece is 5 cm\npieces_each_segment = 5  # Each of the initial four parts is further divided into 5 pieces\ninitial_segments = 4  # Marty initially divides the ribbon into 4 equal parts\n\n# Calculating the total length of the ribbon\nribbon_length = final_cut_length * pieces_each_segment * initial_segments\nprint(ribbon_length)\n```\nThe expected output should be 100.
