As Patty's Plumbing charges for each hour or fraction of an hour, a job that required 2.25 hours of work will be billed for 3 hours (since 2.25 hours rounds up). The cost of labor is $35 per hour, so the total for labor is 3 hours x $35/hour = $105.\n\n2. Add the cost of the service fee and the cost of the parts. The service fee is $40, and the cost of parts is given as $60.\n\n3. The total amount billed by Patty would be the sum of all these costs: $105 for labor, $40 for the service fee, and $60 for parts. Therefore, the total bill is $205."

So, regardless of the hours spent, $40 will always be charged.\n2. Additionally, it costs $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor. The given time is 2.25 hours, indicating it is more than 2. Therefore, it should be considered as 3 hours because time charged in fractions is equivalent to an hour.\n3. The parts worth are $60.\n   \nSo, to calculate the total bill, we add up all these costs.\n\n1. Service fee = $40\n2. Labor cost = $35 x 3 hours = $105\n3. Cost of parts = $60\n\nTherefore, the total cost will be, Service fee + Labor cost + Cost of parts = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205\n\nPatty's Plumbing will bill a total of $205."
