Since a week has seven days, the total will be $30/day * 7 days = $210.\n  \nStep 3: Gerald also did babysitting but for a rate of $0. Which means he did not earn anything from this job. Therefore, the total income from babysitting = $0*2 hours*7 days = $0.\n  \nStep 4: The total money Gerald earned this week = what he earned from the daycare + what he earned from babysitting = $210 + $0 = $210.\n  \nStep 5: Calculate the remaining money after Gerald did grocery shopping. Subtract the amount he spent on groceries from his total income. $210 - $100 = $110.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, Gerald has $110 left."
