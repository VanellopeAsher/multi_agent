      "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of each implant individually. The cost for each regular implant is $2000.5. For an implant with an additional porcelain crown, the cost is $2000.5(base) + $500.5(crown).\n\n2. After getting the individual costs, sum up the two costs to get the total cost of the dental work.\n\n3. George has already put down a $600 deposit. Subtract this from the total cost calculated in step 2.\n\n4. Lastly, given that George earns $15.3 per hour, divide the result from step 3(how much more he has to pay) by his hourly wage to get how many hours George needs to work to afford the dental work. \n\nThis calculation assumes that all of George's wages go toward paying for the dental work. We're also not considering taxes that might be deducted from his pay."

Compute the cost of a normal implant and the cost of an implant with a porcelain crown. \n\n2. Obtain the total cost by summing both values.\n\n3. Deduct the deposit already paid from the total cost to calculate the remaining balance.\n\n4. Lastly, divide the remaining balance by the hourly wage to get the number of hours he needs to work.\n\nMake sure to round up the final result to the nearest whole number since George can't work a fraction of an hour (assuming that your work unit is hourly).\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python."

This problem was solved by realizing it can be framed as a series of arithmetic operations: addition (to calculate the total cost of the implants), subtraction (to factor in the down payment), and then, division (to convert the remaining cost into hours of work). The final result was rounded up because it wouldn't be practical or fair for George to work a fractional amount of time.\n\nSo, the calculation ends in finding that George will need to work for 255 hours to pay for his dental work, given his hourly wage. \n\nThe solutions provided by both agents have been found correct.
