      "content": "The first step to solve this problem is to identify the total cost for the flowers for a single basket. Given that each petunia costs $3.00 and she needs 30 of them for each basket, the total cost of petunias per basket will be the product of the cost of a single petunia and the number of petunias per basket.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the total cost of sweet potato vines for a single basket by multiplying the cost of a single sweet potato vine and the number of vines per basket. \n\nOnce we have the total cost of flowers for a single basket, we can calculate the total cost of filling all 50 baskets by multiplying it by the number of baskets.\n\nTherefore, the process is as follows:\n1. Calculate the total cost for the petunias in one basket: $3.00 * 30 = $90\n2. Calculate the total cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket: $2.50 * 20 = $50\n3. Calculate the total cost for one basket: $90 + 50$ = $140\n4. Calculate the total cost for all 50 baskets: $140 * 50 = $7000. \n\nHence, Katherine will spend $7000 to fill all 50 hanging baskets.\n"
