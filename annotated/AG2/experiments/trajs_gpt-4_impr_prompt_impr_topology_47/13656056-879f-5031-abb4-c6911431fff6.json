To find out how much Gerald earned in a week, you multiply the amount he earns daily ($300) by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\n2. Subtract the total amount of money Gerald spent ($1000) from the total amount he earned in a week to find out how much money he has left.\n\nThe formula for the solution is:\n\n   (Daily pay * Number of days worked) - Total amount spent = Total amount remaining\n\nRemember, Gerald earns $300 daily and he worked for 7 days.
