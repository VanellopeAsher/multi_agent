Divide the total cost of Karate classes by $10 per class to find the maximum number of Karate classes Manny's parents are willing to pay for. \n2. Subtract the total number of Karate classes from the number found in the previous step to find how many classes Manny can miss. \n\nLet's perform these calculations. \n\n1. $60 / $10 = 6 classes\n2. 10 classes - 6 classes = 4 classes\n\nSo, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes. After that, the cost per class that Manny attends will exceed $10, and his parents won't sign him up for further classes. The painting class doesn't factor into this decision."
