Since she has three containers of 64 crayons each, we multiply 3 by 64 to get the total number of crayon pieces.\n\n2. Next, we find out how many crayon muffins Kate can make. Since she uses 8 fragments to make a single muffin, we divide the total number of pieces by 8.\n\n3. Finally, we multiply the total number of muffins by the price per muffin that she can sell them for, $1.50, to get our final answer. This is the total amount of money that Kate can earn. \n\nLet's proceed with this calculation. "
