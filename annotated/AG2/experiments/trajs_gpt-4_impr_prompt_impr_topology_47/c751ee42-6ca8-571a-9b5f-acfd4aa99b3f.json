Divide objects into food and non-food items\n    * Food items: Milk (2 dollars), Eggs (3 dollars), Cookies (2 dollars), Water (1 dollar)\n    * Non-food items: Light bulbs (3 dollars), Cups (3 dollars), Roach traps (4 dollars)\n\n2. Calculate cost for food and non-food items separately.\n    * Total food cost = cost of milk + cost of eggs + cost of cookies + cost of water\n    * Total non-food cost before tax = cost of light bulbs + cost of cups + cost of roach traps\n\n3. Calculate tax for non-food items and add it to non-food cost. Remember the tax is 10%, so cost_with_tax= total_non_food_cost + total_non_food_cost*10/100\n\n4. The total cost will be the sum of cost for food and non-food items including tax.\n\nLet's calculate it."

Agent Code Executor has implemented these steps using Python code, which yielded the correct output 19. \n\nThe 10% tax only applies to non-food items, and this behaviour was correctly captured in the Python code. Also, all variables and rules given in the problem were handled correctly, and no assumptions were made.\n\nBased on the above, I conclude that the total cost of the items that John bought, including the tax, is 19 dollars.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{19}"
