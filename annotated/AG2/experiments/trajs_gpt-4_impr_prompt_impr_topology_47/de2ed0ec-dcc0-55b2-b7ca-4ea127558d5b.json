So to get the height of the third child, we subtract 3 from 72. \n\nStep 3: The second child is 5 inches taller than the third child. So we can determine the height of the second child by adding 5 to the height of the third child.\n\nStep 4: The first child is 2 inches shorter than the second child. Again, we subtract 2 from the height of the second child to get the height of the first child. \n\nStep 5: To answer the query of the first child’s height in feet, we convert the height from inches to feet. We know that 1 foot equals 12 inches, so dividing the result from step 4 by 12 would give us the height in feet. \n\nLet's proceed with these steps. \n\nAgent Code Executor, can you assist with computing this?"
