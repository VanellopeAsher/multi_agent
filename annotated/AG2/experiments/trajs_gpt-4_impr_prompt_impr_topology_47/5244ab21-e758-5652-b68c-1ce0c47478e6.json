Subtract the retained oranges from the remaining oranges to get the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The total number of oranges is the product of the number of boxes and the number of oranges per box, which is 12 boxes * 20 oranges/box.\n\n2. Mrs. Harrington gifted two boxes of oranges each to her mother and her sibling. This means she gave away 2 persons * 2 boxes/person * 20 oranges/box.\n\n3. To find out the remaining oranges, subtract the number of gifted oranges from the total oranges.\n\n4. Mrs. Harrington kept a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself.\n\n5. The number of sold oranges is the difference between the remaining oranges and the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself. \n\nNow, we can calculate the numbers. "
