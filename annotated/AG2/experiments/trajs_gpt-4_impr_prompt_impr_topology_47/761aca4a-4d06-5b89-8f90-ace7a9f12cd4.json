Calculated the depth on Wednesday as two-thirds of Tuesday's depth - that is, (2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet.\n\nThis is consistent with the result obtained from the Python code executed by Agent Code Executor, which also yielded a depth of 16 feet on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, looking over Agent Verifier's report again, my understanding is that the question doesn't actually specify whether the 7 feet increase occurred on Monday or Tuesday.
