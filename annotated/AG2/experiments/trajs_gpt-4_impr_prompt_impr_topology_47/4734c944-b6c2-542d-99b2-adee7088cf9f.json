      "content": "Here is the solution to the problem:\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem.\nFrom the problem, it is stated that Peter spends an equal amount of money every day for a week (7 days total). Initial budget is $70\n\nStep 2: Find the daily expenditure.\nWe divide the total amount of money Peter has by the number of days in a week.\nDaily expenditure = Total money / Number of days\n                          = $70 / 7\n                          \nStep 3: Find the number of wooden action figures bought.\nPeter spends his daily budget on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday, hence for 4 days. \nEach wooden action figure costs $5.\nSo, we find how many wooden action figures he buys daily and multiply it by the 4 days.\nNumber of wooden action figures = (Daily expenditure / Cost of an action figure) * 4\n                                                      = ($10 / $5) * 4\n                                      \nStep 4: Find the number of plastic action figures bought.\nFor the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter spends his daily budget on plastic action figures which cost $2.5 each.\nAgain, we find how many plastic action figures he buys per day and multiply it by the 3 remaining days.\nNumber of plastic action figures = (Daily expenditure / Cost of an action figure) * 3\n                                                        = ($10 / $2.5) * 3\n                                     \nStep 5: Find the total number of action figures bought.\nWe add the number of wooden action figures to the number of plastic action figures to get the total number of action figures.\nTotal action figures = Number of wooden action figures + Number of plastic action figures\n\nThe answer will be the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use Python code. We'll follow these steps: \n\n1. Calculate Peter's daily budget by dividing his total money by 7 (the number of days in a week).\n2. Calculate the number of wooden action figures he buys from Sunday through Wednesday by dividing his daily budget by the cost of a wooden action figure and multiplying by 4.\n3. Calculate the number of plastic action figures he buys from Thursday through Saturday by dividing his daily budget by the cost of a plastic action figure and multiplying by 3.\n4. Find the total number of action figures by adding up the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures.\n\nLet's do this in Python: \n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define all the known quantities\ntotal_money = 70  # Total money Peter has in dollars\ndays_in_week = 7  # Total number of days in a week\ncost_of_wooden_figure = 5  # Cost of a wooden action figure in dollars\ncost_of_plastic_figure = 2.5  # Cost of a plastic action figure in dollars\ndays_of_wooden_figures = 4  # Number of days Peter buys wooden action figures\ndays_of_plastic_figures = 3  # Number of days Peter buys plastic action figures\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Peter's daily expenditure\ndaily_expenditure = total_money / days_in_week\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of wooden action figures\nnum_wooden_figures = (daily_expenditure / cost_of_wooden_figure) * days_of_wooden_figures\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of plastic action figures\nnum_plastic_figures = (daily_expenditure / cost_of_plastic_figure) * days_of_plastic_figures\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total number of action figures\ntotal_figures = num_wooden_figures + num_plastic_figures\n\nprint(total_figures)\n```\nI suggest that I should execute this code next."

Agent Code Executor's Python code-based solution:\n    - The Python code aligns with the logical steps laid out.\n    - The code tested successfully and returned the answer, 20.\n\nBy examining both agents' outputs, I conclude that the final solution is 20.
