According to the problem, the second aircraft makes 44 flights, which is said to be half the total flights of the first aircraft. So we can form the equation: 0.5*`F1` = 44. From this equation, we can derive `F1` = 44 * 2 = 88.\n3. Then what remains after the flights to Greece by aircraft 1 is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of `F1` which is to be divided evenly between France and Germany. This means France gets half of these flights.\n4. Therefore, the number of flights by the first aircraft to France is: `F1` * 1/4 * 0.5 = 88 * 1/4 * 0.5.\n\nLet me finish the calculations."
