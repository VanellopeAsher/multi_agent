This can be done by dividing the total cost of bacon ($10.5) by the number of packs (5).  \n2. To find the cost of all the chicken packs, first calculate the price of a single packet of chicken. It's given that one packet of chicken costs twice as much as one pack of bacon. Then multiply this price by the number of chicken packets.\n3. Proceed to calculate the cost for all packs of strawberries and apples. It's is given that strawberries cost $4.5 each and apples are half the price of each pack of strawberries. After finding the price of one pack of apples, calculate the total cost for all the apples.\n4. Add all the calculated totals together to get the total shopping cost. \n5. Finally, subtract the total shopping cost from Kelly's budget, which is $65. The result will be how much money Kelly has left in her budget. \n"

Finally, they subtracted this total cost from Kelly's budget, which was $65. \n\nAgent Problem Solver proposed these steps theoretically. \n\nAgent Code Executor translated these steps into Python code, executing it to reveal that Kelly will have approximately $0.05 left in her budget.\n\nAfter comparing and evaluating both proposed solutions, I concur with the final result presented. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{0.05}"
