So, total days from March 1st to April 19th are 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.\n   \n2. Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 50 days is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days. \n\n3. Therefore, Billy works for 50 (total days) - 10 (off days) = 40 days.\n\n4. He helps 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours a day. So, in a day, he helps 2 (people per hour) * 3.5 (hours) = 7 people.\n\n5. As he works for 40 days and helps 7 people a day, he helps in total 40 (days) * 7 (people per day) = 280 people.  \n\nHence, Billy helps 280 people in total from March 1st to April 19th."
