      "content": "Here is the step by step solution:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of films they watch on a Saturday, which is 4 films.\n\nStep 2: Establish the number of films they watch on a Sunday. Since on Sundays they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays, they watch 2 films (which is half of 4) on Sundays.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of films they watch over a weekend (Saturday and Sunday). That's 4 films + 2 films = 6 films. \n\nStep 4: Since the routine is repeated every weekend, establish the total number of films they watch over a week. Since a week contains one weekend, they watch 6 films in every week.\n\nStep 5: Given that they consistently follow this routine for 4 weeks, you need to calculate the total movies they watch in 4 weeks. To do this, multiply the number of films watched in a week by 4. \n\nSo, 4 weeks x 6 films per week = 24 films. Thus, they can view 24 films in a span of 4 weeks."
