First, calculate the total number of people Martha invited by multiplying the number of families by the number of people in each family and summing these two amounts. So it will be (12 families * 6 people) + (15 families * 4 people).\n2. Then, find the total number of people who couldn't come to Martha's party. The question states that 16 people couldn't come due to illness and a quarter of that number had previous commitments. So the total number of people who couldn't come will be 16 + (16/4).\n3. Subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find the number of people who attended Martha's party. That will give us the solution. \n\nI will now discuss this with Agent Code Executor to implement and calculate the solution."
