Find the number of eggs she consumes in a week: Multiply the number of eggs she uses each day by 7, the number of days in a week. This gives us 21 eggs.\n\n3. Calculate how many eggs she eats over the 12-week period: Multiply the number of eggs she consumes weekly by 12 to get the total number of eggs she consumes in 12 weeks. This gives us a total of 252 eggs.\n\n4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens: Finally, divide the total number of eggs by 12, since a dozen contains 12 items.

According to their solution, Claire will need 21 dozens of eggs to make her 3-egg omelette every morning for 12 weeks. \n\nLet's summarize the steps taken:\n\n1. We identified that Claire used 3 eggs each day for her omelette.\n2. This was multiplied by 7 to identify the number of eggs utilized in a week (3*7 = 21 eggs).\n3. The weekly egg consumption was then multiplied by 12 to find the total number of eggs she would need for 12 weeks (21*12 = 252 eggs).\n4. Finally, we divided the total by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen) to find the number of dozens of eggs Claire would need for her 12 weeks of omelettes (252/12 = 21 dozens).\n\nWith the problem-solving and computational capacities of Agents Problem Solver and Code Executor, we concluded that Claire would need 21 dozens of eggs for her breakfast omelettes over a 12 week period."
