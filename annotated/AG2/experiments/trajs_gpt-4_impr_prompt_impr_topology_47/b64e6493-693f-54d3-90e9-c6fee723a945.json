A dime is worth 10 cents, so 60 dimes equal to 60 * 10 cents.\n3. A nickel is worth 5 cents, so 140 nickels equal to 140 * 5 cents.\n4. A penny is worth 1 cent, so 150 pennies equal to 150 * 1 cent.\n\nNow we add all these values to find the total money he has. \n\nNext, since the cost of a gumball is 5 cents, we take the total money calculated and divide it by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy."
