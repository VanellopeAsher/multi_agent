Each box contains 3 packets and each packet can make 8 big smores. Therefore, one box makes 3 * 8 = 24 smores.\n\nStep 5: Divide the total number of smores needed by the number of smores per box. \n\nStep 6: If the result from step 5 is not a whole number, round up to ensure there is enough for everyone, as we can't purchase a fraction of a box. \n\nStep 7: The result will tell us the number of boxes we need to purchase. \n\nLet's proceed with these steps."

Thus, find out how many Smores a box can make since it contains 3 packets.\n\nFor Step 4, divide the total required Smores by the number of Smores a box can make. If the division results in a decimal, round up to the nearest whole number as we can't purchase a fraction of a box.\n\nFinally, print the result. \n\nLet's implement this."
