Calculate the earnings per day from Monday to Friday:\n   - Each day she teaches 5 classes\n   - Each class has 15 students\n   - She charges $15.00 per student for each class\n   - So, her earnings per day from Monday to Friday = 5 classes * 15 students/class * $15.00/student/class\n\n2. Calculate the earnings for Saturday:\n   - On Saturday she teaches 8 classes\n   - Each class has 15 students\n   - She charges $15.00 per student for each class\n   - So, her earnings on Saturday = 8 classes * 15 students/class * $15.00/student/class\n\n3. Calculate the total earnings for the week:\n   - Her total earnings for the week = 5 days * (earnings per day from Monday to Friday) + (earnings on Saturday)\n\nSince Sunday is her day off, we don't have to consider her earnings on this day as it would be $0. \n\nNote: The free 5-minute warm-up session does not affect her earnings, so we don't need to consider this in our calculations. \n\nOnce this calculation is complete, we know how much money Judy makes in one week."

Additionally, they both correctly ignore the free 5-minute warm-up session, as it doesn't impact her earnings.\n\nIn conclusion, both solutions concur and adhere to the problem's parameters.
