She gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees (i.e. 30/2 = 15 apples), and 350 apples from the average height trees.\n   \n2. Determine the amount of apples Joanne’s sister gathered from the tallest trees. According to the task, Joanne's sister gathered twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne did, which means she gathered 2*30 = 60 apples.\n\n3. To ascertain the total number of apples gathered by both sisters, subtract the quantity gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest trees from the combined total of 500 apples. This will provide the quantity of apples Joanne's sister collected from the shortest trees.\n\n4. Divide the number of apples Joanne's sister picked from the shortest trees by the 15 apples picked by Joanne from the shortest trees to find out how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees.\n   \nApplying these steps will provide the desired answer."
