Sum up these hours to find the total number of hours worked over the three days.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n- On Tuesday, we already know that Bruce has worked for 5 hours.\n- On Wednesday, Bruce works double the duration of Tuesday's hours. Therefore, his Wednesday's work hours is 5 (from Tuesday) * 2 = 10 hours.\n- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday. Therefore, his Thursday work hours is 10 (from Wednesday) - 2 = 8 hours.\n  \nFinally, summing up the hours worked for the three days:\n   Total work hours = Tuesday hours + Wednesday hours + Thursday hours\n                                      = 5                  + 10                 + 8\n                                      = 23 hours. \n\nSo, Bruce has worked a total of 23 hours over these three days."

Assign the number of hours Bruce worked on Tuesday to a variable, `tuesday_hours`.\n2.

Calculate the number of hours Bruce worked on Thursday (which is 2 less than Wednesday's hours) and assign it to a variable, `thursday_hours`.\n4. Add `tuesday_hours`, `wednesday_hours`, and `thursday_hours` to get the total number of hours Bruce worked over these three days.\n\nHere is the Python code for that:"
