On the second day, the amount doubled, so it became 4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n3.  On the third day, the total amount of water passing through the river was 14000 gallons.\n4. To find the increased amount on the third day, subtract the total amount of the second day from the total amount of the third day. Hence, 14000 gallons (total amount on the third day) - 8000 gallons (total amount on the second day) = 6000 gallons.\n\nThis implies an increase of 6000 gallons in the water passing through the river on the third day."
