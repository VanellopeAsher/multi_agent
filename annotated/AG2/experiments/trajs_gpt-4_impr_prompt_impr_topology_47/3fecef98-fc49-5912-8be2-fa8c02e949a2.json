This means the dimensions of each piece of fabric for the comforter should be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, or 8 feet by 10 feet. The total area for each piece of fabric for the comforter is therefore 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since he needs two pieces of this size, he'll require 2 * 80 = 160 square feet for the comforter.\n\n2. Duvet cover: The dimensions for each piece of fabric for the duvet is 9 feet by 11 feet. Thus, the total area for each piece of fabric for the duvet cover is 9 * 11 = 99 square feet. As he needs two pieces of this size as well, he'll require 2 * 99 = 198 square feet for the duvet cover.\n\nAdding these together, Jim will need 160 square feet for the comforter and 198 square feet for the duvet cover, totaling 160 + 198 = 358 square feet of fabric."

They noted that Jim also required fabric for two sides of the duvet. To obtain the total fabric requirement, the agents added together the total areas calculated for both the comforter and duvet.\n\nBoth agents correctly identified they needed to calculate the area of two separate objects, each requiring two pieces of fabric. Neither agent made assumptions about the problem or the solution. \n\nGiven their consistency and the accuracy in their step-by-step processes, I concur with their solutions. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{358}. \nJim needs to purchase a total of 358 square feet of fabric."
