We can calculate the total time he spent, from that:\n\n- 15 hours is 30% of the total time, that means the total time (100%) is 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours.\n\nFinally, to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, we subtract the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows from the total time:\n\n- 50 (total time) - 15 (time spent on initial activities) = 35 hours.\n\nSo, John spent 35 hours sightseeing."
