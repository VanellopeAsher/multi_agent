      "content": "Here's how you can derive the solution step by step:\n\n1. Start with the lines from the solo song. Sean has to memorize all 54 lines.\n2. The first scene has twice the number of lines of the song. That means it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. But Sean only has to memorize a third of them, so that's 108 / 3 = 36 lines.\n3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, or 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Of these, Sean has to memorize four-fifths, or 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.\n4. Additionally, Sean has to memorize 15 additional lines in the second scene due to the absence of another actor.\n5. In total, Sean has to memorize 54 lines (from the song) + 36 lines (from the first scene) + 48 lines (from the second scene) + 15 additional lines = 153 lines. \n\nSo, Sean has to memorize 153 lines. Let's discuss this and see if we agree."

The first scene has twice the number of lines, so set the variable `first_scene` to 2 * `solo_song`. But Sean only memorizes one third of these lines (1/3 * `first_scene`).\n3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so set the variable `second_scene` to `solo_song` + 6. Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the lines. So multiply `second_scene` by 4/5.\n4. Additionally, Sean has to memorize 15 lines because one actor can't come. I will add this to the `second_scene`.\n5. Add `solo_song`, `first_scene`, and `second_scene` to get the total lines that Sean needs to memorize. \n\nLet's check this with the code now."
