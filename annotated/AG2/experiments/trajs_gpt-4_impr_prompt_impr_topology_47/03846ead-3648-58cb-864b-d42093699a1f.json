Calculate Bella's points: Since Bella has collected 30% more than Alex's 60 points,\n   Bella's points = 60 points (Alex) + 30/100 * 60 points = 78 points\n\n2. Calculate Tim's points: Since Tim has 40 points less than Bella's 78, \n   Tim's points = 78 points (Bella) - 40 points = 38 points\n\n3. Calculating Mary's points: Mary collected 3 times more points that Tim who has 38 points, \n   Mary's points = 3 * 38 points (Tim) = 114 points\n\n4. Total points collected by the class: \n   Total points = Alex's points + Bella's points + Tim's points + Mary's points = 60 + 78 + 38 + 114 = 290 points\n\n5. Calculate how many points the class is missing for the field trip:\n   Missing points = Minimum threshold for field trip - Total points collected by the class = 500 - 290 = 210 points. \n\nTherefore, the class is missing 210 points to go on the field trip."
