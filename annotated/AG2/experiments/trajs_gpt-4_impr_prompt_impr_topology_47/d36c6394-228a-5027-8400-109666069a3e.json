For the first stop:\n   - Subtract the number of passengers who get off (8 passengers).\n   - Add the number of passengers who get on which, according to the problem, is 5 times the number of people who got off (5 * 8 = 40 passengers).\n   - Subtract the number of passengers who decide to get off after getting on, which is 2 passengers.\n\n3. For the second stop:\n   - Subtract the number of passengers who get off, which is 21 passengers.\n   - Add the number of passengers who get on. According to the problem, this is 3 times fewer than the number of passengers who got off, meaning it's a third of 21 (21 / 3 = 7 passengers).\n\n4. The resulting number will be the total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop."
