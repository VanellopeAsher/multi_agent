This gives us a total of 60 students.\n\nHowever, when considering the total number of students in the grade level, we must consider that these 20 students (who do not have a desktop computer) represent 25% of the total number of students. Therefore, to calculate the total number of students, we multiply 20 by 4, which equals 80.\n\nSo, there are 80 students at that grade level in total.
