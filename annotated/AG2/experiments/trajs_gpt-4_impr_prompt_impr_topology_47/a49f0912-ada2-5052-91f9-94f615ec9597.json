He spent half this time, ie, 60/2 = 30 hours swimming.\n\n3. The total time he spent boating and swimming is 60 + 30 = 90 hours.\n\n4. He watched 30 shows at 20 hours each, totalling 30 * 20 = 600 hours.\n\n5. This show-watching time was 30% of his total time. Hence, what we can infer is, 600 hours is 30% of his total time.\n\n6. To calculate the total time, we will divide the hours of show-watching by 0.30(30%).  \n\n7. Finally, we know that 40% of this total time was spent sightseeing. We can calculate this time by multiplying the total time by 0.40(40%).\nSteve will provide help with the calculations."

Then we use the time spent watching shows and its percentage to find the total time spent on vacation. Lastly, we find out the time spent sightseeing.\nHere is the Python code to calculate it.\n\n```python\n# time spent on boating\nboating_time = 60\n\n# time spent on swimming\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\n\n# total time spent on boating and swimming\nboating_swimming_time = boating_time + swimming_time\n\n# time spent watching shows\nshows_time = 30 * 20\n\n# shows time is 30% of the total time\n# therefore, total_time = shows_time / 0.30\ntotal_time = shows_time / 0.30\n\n# 40% of total time is spent sightseeing\n# therefore, sightseeing_time = total_time * 0.40\nsightseeing_time = total_time * 0.40\n\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

      "content": "Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor executed the problem accurately. They've checked all the variables given in the problem without assuming any other values. The time spent on boating was given as 60 hours. Boating time was doubled to find the time spent on swimming since it was stated that swimming was done for half the time of boating, yielding 30 hours. Adding these times together got the total time for behaviour and swimming as 90 hours. The time spent on watching shows was calculated by multiplying the 30 shows by their length, 20 hours, to get 600 hours. The total vacation time was found by considering this show-watching time as 30% of the total duration of the vacation. Therefore, dividing the 600 hours by 0.3 gives the overall vacation time, which is 2000 hours. Sightseeing took up 40% of this time, so multiplying 2000 by 0.4 gives the sightseeing time as 800 hours.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is that John spent 800 hours sightseeing during his vacation. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{800}** hours."
