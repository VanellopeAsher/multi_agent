The total spend = aquarium cost + bags of rock cost + coral cost + fish food cost.\n\nStep 3: We don't include what she spent on buying the 20 fish since the cost for it has not been provided in the problem. If the price per fish has been given we could've included that in our calculation. \n\nNote: The solution is assuming that the price of the 20 fish is not included in the total calculation, as there is no information provided about how much each fish cost. The statement \"she bought 20 fish\" could be interpreted as an expense, but without a price per fish, it's impossible to include this in the calculation. If there was a price per fish provided, we would include that cost in the total as well.  Let's see if others have different views."
