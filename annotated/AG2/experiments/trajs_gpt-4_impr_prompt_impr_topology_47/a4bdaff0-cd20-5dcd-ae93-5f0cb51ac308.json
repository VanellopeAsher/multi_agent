      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to use basic arithmetic. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Firstly, we have to find out the minimum payments Jessica must pay each month by summing the minimum payments for all her debts: the student loan, the credit card, and the mortgage. The formula is:\n\n   `Total minimum payment per month = student loan + credit card + mortgage`\n\n2. Secondly, we need to calculate the amount Jessica wants to pay each month, which is 50% more than the minimum. We calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment. The formula is:\n\n   `Jessica's monthly payment = Total minimum payment per month + 50% of Total minimum payment per month`\n\n3. Finally, we calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year. We know there are 12 months in a year, so we multiply Jessica's monthly payment by 12.\n\n   `Total payment per year = Jessica's monthly payment x 12`\n\nLet's calculate each of these steps. \n\nThis is my proposed solution, now let's discuss it. Are there any questions or suggestions?"

Therefore, Jessica's annual payment would be $15000 * 12 = $180000.\n\nI'll proceed to execute Python code that follows this plan. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
