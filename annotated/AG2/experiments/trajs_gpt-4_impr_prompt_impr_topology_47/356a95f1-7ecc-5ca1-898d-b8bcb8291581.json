This means if Sam and Harry were to get an equal share of the fence, each would get 100 feet.\n\nSTEP 3: Take into account that Harry is getting 80 feet more than Sam\nTo fulfill this condition, we have to take 80 feet from Sam's portion and give it to Harry. This means that Sam gets 100 - 80 = 20 feet of the fence.\n\nSo, Sam is left with 20 feet of the fence."
