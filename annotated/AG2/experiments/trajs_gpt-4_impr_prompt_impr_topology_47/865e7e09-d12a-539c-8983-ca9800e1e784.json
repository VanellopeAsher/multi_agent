Since each got 1/4 of the 32 liters, they each got 32/4 = 8 liters of water.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total amount of water the girls took by adding the amounts each got. Since they each got 8 liters, they collectively got 8 + 8 = 16 liters\n\nStep 3: Find the total amount of water that the girls and the boy took collectively by adding the amount the girls took to that of the boy's. Since the boy got 8 liters and the girls took 16 liters, they collectively got 8 + 16 = 24 liters\n\nStep 4: Determine the remaining amount of water by subtracting the collective amount of water taken by the girls and the boy from the initial total amount of water. Since the total initial amount of water was 32 liters and they collectively took 24 liters, the remaining amount is 32 - 24 = 8 liters of water. \n\nSo, there were 8 liters of water left."
