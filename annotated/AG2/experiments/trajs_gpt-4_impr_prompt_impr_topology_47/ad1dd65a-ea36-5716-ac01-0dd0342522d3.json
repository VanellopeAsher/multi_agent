So the cost of phones will be 5*700$. Then, we add the cost of the tablet and the headphones to the total cost of the phones.\n\nThe next step is to calculate how much change should be given back. We do this by subtracting the total cost of all items from the amount provided by the buyer, which is 4000$.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the phones: 5 * 700$\n2. Add this to the cost of the tablet: (5 * 700) + 330$\n3. Then add the cost of the headphones: (5 * 700) + 330 + 137$\n4. Subtract this total cost from the amount provided by the buyer: 4000 - [(5 * 700) + 330 + 137] to get the change."
