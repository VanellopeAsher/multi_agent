My job as Agent Verifier is to check if this solution is correct - and it is. \n\nThe problem was that Carver is 60 years old, which is 8 years less than twice the age of his son. Therefore, 2 times the son's age - 8 equals 60. By solving this equation for the son's age, we get 34, which matches the solutions provided by both agents. \n\nThus, the final solution is: \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{34}**."
