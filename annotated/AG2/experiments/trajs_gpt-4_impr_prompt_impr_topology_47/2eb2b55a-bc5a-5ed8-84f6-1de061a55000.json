This means that, at the start of this day, they had what they ended up with, plus what they used, minus what they bought, so 78 + 25 - 100 = 3 bandages.\n\nDay 2: On this day, they used 10 bandages fewer than on the first day, so 38 - 10 = 28 bandages were used. They did not buy any on this day, so at the beginning of the day, they had 3 (remaining from day 3) + 28 (used on this day) = 31 bandages.\n\nDay 1: They used 38 bandages and bought one pack or 50 bandages. Therefore, they began the day with what they ended up with, plus what they used, minus what they bought, so 31 + 38 - 50 = 19 bandages.\n\nSo, at the start of the first day, they had 19 bandages."
