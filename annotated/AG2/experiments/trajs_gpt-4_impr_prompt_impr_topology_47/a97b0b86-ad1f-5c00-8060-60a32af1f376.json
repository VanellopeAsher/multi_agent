Divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost of a single box of pizza to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. \n\nLet's start with step 1:\n\n- The cost of one chicken meal is $12.\n- The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3.5 = $17.5.\n- The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.5 = $6.\n\nIn step 2, add those amounts together:\n\n- $12 (chicken) + $17.5 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $35.5\n\nIn step 3, subtract this total from the total amount paid by Marie:\n\n- $52.5 (total paid) - $35.5 (total cost excluding pizza) = $17\n\nFinally, in step 4, divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost of a single pizza box:\n\n- $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes\n\nSo, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
