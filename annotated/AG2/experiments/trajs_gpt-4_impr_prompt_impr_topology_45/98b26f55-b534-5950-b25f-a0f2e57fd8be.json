He assumes that Jordan would work the same hours every day of the week that he usually spends playing video games. Then, he multiplies these total hours by Jordan's hourly wage to get the total earnings that Jordan would make if he was working instead of playing video games. According to Agent Code Executor's calculations, Jordan would make $210 in a week. \n\nThe solution from Agent Problem Solver was based on the same logic and assumptions as that from Agent Code Executor.\n\nGiven these observations and the nature of the problem, I agree with the solution. There are no leaps in logic or assumptions of unspecified variables in the given problem. The calculations are correct. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{210}**.
