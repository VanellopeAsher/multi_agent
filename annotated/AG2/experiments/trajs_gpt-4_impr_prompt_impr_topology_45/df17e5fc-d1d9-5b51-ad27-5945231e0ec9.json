We know that half of the mural is yellow, which means the other half is equally divided between red, white, and purple. Thus, we can follow the steps below to find how many pints of red paint were used:\n\n1. Determine the amount of paint used for the yellow section of the mural. Since it's half the mural, it's half of the total paint used.\n2. Determine how much paint was used for the remaining 3 colors, which we do by subtracting yellow's part from the total.\n3. As the remaining paint (red, white, and purple) is distributed equally, divide this remaining quantity by 3 to find out how much of each color was used.\n\nLet's work on these steps now."

Since half the mural is yellow, and the mural in total used 12 pints of paint, 12/2 = 6 pints of yellow paint were used.\n\nStep 2. The remaining paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints, which was used for the red, white, and purple parts of the mural.\n\nStep 3. Since these are distributed equally among red, white, and purple, each color used 6/3 = 2 pints of paint.\n\nSo, the red paint used is 2 pints.\n\nLet's execute the math in Python code for clarity.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_paint_distribution(total_paint):\n    yellow_paint = total_paint / 2 # half the mural is yellow, so half the total paint is used for yellow\n    remaining_paint = total_paint - yellow_paint # the remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple\n    red_paint = remaining_paint / 3 # among three colors these are distributed equally\n    return red_paint\n\nred_paint = calculate_paint_distribution(12)\n\nprint(red_paint, 'pints')\n```\n\nNow let's execute this code."

First, the total amount of paint - which is 12 pints - is cut in half as half of the mural is colored in yellow. This gives us six pints of yellow paint. Subsequently, we deduce that the remaining six pints are equally divided between red, white, and purple, with two pints each.\n\nVerifying this against the problem statement, I can confirm that the solution is consistent with the provided details: equal distribution of the remaining colors and the consumption of half the total paint for the yellow portion.\n\nTherefore, SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{2} pints of red paint were used."
