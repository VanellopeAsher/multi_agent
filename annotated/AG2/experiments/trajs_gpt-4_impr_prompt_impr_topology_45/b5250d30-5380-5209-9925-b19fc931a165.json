      "content": "To solve this question, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Since Jill and her friends watch 4 films every Saturday, they will watch 4 films * 4 Saturdays = 16 films in 4 weeks.\n\n2. On Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays. Therefore, they watch 4 films/2 = 2 films each Sunday. So, over 4 Sundays they will watch 2 films * 4 Sundays = 8 films.\n\n3. To find the total number of films they watch in 4 weeks, add the number of films watched on Saturdays to the number of films watched on Sundays. Therefore, the total number of films they watch is 16 films (from Saturdays) + 8 films (from Sundays) = 24 films. \n\nSo, Jill and her friends can watch a total of 24 films in 4 weeks if they follow this routine."

Finally, add the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the total number of films watched in 4 weeks.\n\n```python\n# Number of films watched on Saturdays\nfilms_on_saturday = 4\n\n# Number of films watched on Sundays\nfilms_on_sunday = films_on_saturday / 2\n\n# Number of weeks\nweeks = 4\n\n# Calculate total films watched on Saturdays in 4 weeks\ntotal_films_on_saturdays = films_on_saturday * weeks\n\n# Calculate total films watched on Sundays in 4 weeks\ntotal_films_on_sundays = films_on_sunday * weeks\n\n# Calculate total films watched in 4 weeks\ntotal_films = total_films_on_saturdays + total_films_on_sundays\n\nprint(total_films)\n```\nI suggest executing the above code.
