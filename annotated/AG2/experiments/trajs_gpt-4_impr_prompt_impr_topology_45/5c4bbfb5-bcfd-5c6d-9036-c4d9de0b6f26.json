      "content": "Here is the process to solve this problem:\n\n1. Find the price per packet of bacon by dividing the total price of the bacon by the number of packets. Kelly bought 5 packs for $10.5, so each packet cost $10.5/5 = $2.1.\n\n2. Determine the price per packet of chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a packet of bacon so each packet costs 2*$2.1 = $4.2.\n\n3. Calculate the total price for the chicken packets. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken packets is 6*$4.2 = $25.2.\n\n4. Calculate the total price for the strawberries. Kelly bought 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.5, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3*$4.5 = $13.5.\n\n5. Determine the price per pack of apples. Each pack of apples costs half as much as a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4.5/2 = $2.25.\n\n6. Calculate the total price for the apple packs. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7* $2.25 = $15.75.\n\n7. Add up the total expenditure. The total expenditure is $10.5 (bacon) + $25.2 (chicken) + $13.5 (strawberries) + $15.75 (apples) = $64.95.\n\n8. Calculate how much money Kelly has left. Subtract the total expenditure from the budget. Kelly has $65 - $64.95 = $0.05 left."

The cost of bacon was determined to be $2.1 per pack, resulting in a total cost of $10.5.  \n2. This information was used to determine the cost of the chicken at $4.2 per pack (since each pack of chicken was twice the cost of a pack of bacon). This resulted in a total cost of $25.2 for the chicken.  \n3. The total cost of the strawberries was then found to be $13.5  \n4. Using the price of strawberries, they calculated the cost of apples to be $2.25 per pack (since each pack of apples was half the cost of a pack of strawberries) and found the total cost of apples to be $15.75.  \n5. Adding all these costs gave a total expenditure of $64.95.  \n6. Subtracting this from the available budget of $65 left Kelly with $0.05."
