Calculate the total cost of the 2 bags of rocks. Each bag costs $2.50, so 2 bags would cost 2.50 * 2 = $5.00\n\nStep 3. Determine the total cost of the 3 pieces of coral. Each piece costs $2.00, so 3 pieces would total to 2.00 * 3 = $6.00 \n\nStep 4. Add up the cost of the fish food which is $2.00.\n\nStep 5. Since the cost of the fish is not specified, it would not be included in the total cost.\n\nStep 6. Add all 4 totals together to find out how much Scarlett spent in total.\n\nThe result would be the sum of $10.00, $5.00, $6.00 and $2.00."
