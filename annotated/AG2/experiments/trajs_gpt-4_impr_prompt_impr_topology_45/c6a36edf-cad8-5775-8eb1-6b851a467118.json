The product will be the total amount of money she could earn.\n\nSo, the equation to find the total amount of money would be ((3 * 64) / 8) * $1.50.\n\nAnd that's our solution. The one thing to remember is that this only works if every 8 fragments can make a perfect muffin, and there are no leftover fragments."
