Each boy brought back 600 seashells, so the total seashells brought by the boys is 600 * 100 = 60,000 seashells.\n\n3. The girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by each girl = 600 (number of seashells brought by each boy) + 4 * 600 (four times the number of seashells brought by each boy) = 2400 seashells.\n\nTherefore, each girl brought back 2400 seashells."
