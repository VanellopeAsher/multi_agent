Therefore, multiply 2 packs * $2/pack = $4.\n2. Determine the cost of the green apple gum: This cost half as much as a pack of grape gum, and we know the grape gum costs $2. So, 1 pack of green apple gum = $2 / 2 = $1.\n3. Sum the costs of the strawberry, grape, and apple packs: $4 (for strawberry) + $2 (for grape) + $1 (for apple) = $7.\n\nSo, Suzie paid a total of $7 for all the packs of gum."

As it costs half of what the grape gum costs, we will divide the cost of the grape gum, which is $2, by 2.\n3. Finally, we will add the costs of all the three types of gum packs together - the cost of strawberry, grape, and green apple gum. \n\nThis will give us the total amount Suzie paid for all the packs of gum."
