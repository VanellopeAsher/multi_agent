So, the total cost of apples before the discount is  15*$15\n        - After she applied her voucher, she got $3 off. Therefore, her final price is calculated by deducting $3 from the total cost of apples.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total price Sheila paid on Wednesday\n        - Sheila bought the same number of apples (15) but at a price of $25 each. So, the total cost of apples before the discount is 15*$25\n        - There was a 15% off discount on Wednesday. This discount is applied to the total price of the apples, leading to the final price that Sheila paid.\n\nStep 3: Find the difference in final prices\n        - Subtract the final price that Clara paid on Tuesday from the final price that Sheila paid on Wednesday to find the difference."
