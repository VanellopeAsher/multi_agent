So the total number of smores required by children = 2 smores/child * 9 children = 18 smores.\n- Each adult wants 1 smore and there are 6 adults. So the total number of smores required by adults = 1 smore/adult * 6 adults = 6 smores.\n\nBy summing up the above numbers, we obtain the total number of smores required = 18 smores (children) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of smores that can be made with a box of graham crackers.\n\nWe know that:\n- 1 packet of graham crackers can make 8 smores.\n- A box of graham crackers contains 3 packets. Therefore, the total number of smores that can be made with 1 box = 8 smores/packet * 3 packets/box = 24 smores/box.\n\nTherefore, to make 24 smores, we would require 1 box of graham crackers.\n\nHence, 1 box of graham crackers is necessary.\n\nLet's bring this to the team discussion."
