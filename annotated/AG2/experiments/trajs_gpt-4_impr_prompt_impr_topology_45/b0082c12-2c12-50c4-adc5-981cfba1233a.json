This amounts to 3 * 20 = $60. However,  Leah received a 10% discount on the total vaccine cost, meaning Leah only pays 90% of the total vaccine cost. This amounts to 0.90 * $60 = $54.\n\n3. Cost of broken vases: Each broken vase costs $12, and there were 4 broken vases. Thus, the total cost for the broken vases was 4 * 12 = $48.\n\nTo find the total cost incurred for the kitten, the cost of each part can be added together. This amounts to $200 for spaying, $54 for vaccines, and $48 for the broken vases, which totals up to $200 + $54 + $48 = $302. Hence, the kitten has cost Leah $302 so far."
