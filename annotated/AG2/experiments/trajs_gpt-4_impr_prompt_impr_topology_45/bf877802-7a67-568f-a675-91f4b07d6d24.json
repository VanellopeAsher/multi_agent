      "content": "To solve this task:\n\n1. **Identify the original position of the sun:** We start with the sun at the tip of the pyramid. Since the pyramid sits at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when viewed from Sahir's house, we can assume the sun is also at an angle of 32 degrees initially.\n\n2. **Calculate the new position of the sun after the first movement:** For the first part of its movement, the sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour for a total of 10 hours. This implies that the sun would move a total of 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.\n\n3. **Add the amount the sun has moved to its original position:** This gives us 32 degrees (the initial position of the sun) + 50 degrees (the total amount the sun has moved) = 82 degrees. This is the angle from the ground to the sun after the first part of its movement.\n\n4. **Calculate the new position of the sun after the second movement:** For the second part of its movement, the sun is moving at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for a total of 2 hours. This implies that the sun would move a total of 3 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 6 degrees.\n\n5. **Add the second movement of the sun to its position after the first movement:** This gives us 82 degrees (the position of the sun after the first part of its movement) + 6 degrees (the total amount the sun has moved during the second part of its movement) = 88 degrees.\n\nThe solution is 88 degrees. The sun will be at an angle of 88 degrees from the ground after the entire movement."
