We aren't given the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week. Instead, we're told it was \"several inches tall.\" As such, we will need to create a general equation that can adapt to varying initial beanstalk heights.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Let's assume the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week be 'h'.\n2. In the second week, the height doubled. So, it would be '2h'.\n3. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. Thus, the total height will be '2h + 4'.\n\nPlease update the problem with the initial height after the first week for an exact calculation. Otherwise, the height after the third week is 2h + 4, where h is the height after the first week."
