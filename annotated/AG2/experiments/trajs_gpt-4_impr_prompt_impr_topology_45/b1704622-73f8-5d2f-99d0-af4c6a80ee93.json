To find out the total work hours of Bruce over the three days, we first need to work out his individual day work hours.\n\n2. From the problem, we know that he worked for 5 hours on Tuesday.\n\n3. On Wednesday, Bruce worked double the hours he did on Tuesday. We can get this by multiplying 5 hours by 2, which gives us 10 hours.\n\n4. On Thursday, he worked 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday. With Wednesday being 10 hours, subtracting 2 hours from this gives 8 hours.\n\n5. To get the total work hours over the three days, we sum up the work hours of each day: 5 hours (Tuesday) + 10 hours (Wednesday) + 8 hours (Thursday). This should give us the total work hours."
