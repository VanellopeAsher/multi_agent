She gathered half of 30, which is 15, from the shortest trees.\n3. And she gathered 350 from the average trees.\n\nThus, we can then determine that Joanne gathered a total of 30 + 15 + 350 = 395 apples.\n\nNext, it's given that the sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne did, so the sister gathered 30×2 = 60 apples.\n\nIt's also given that the sisters combined gathered a total of 500 apples, of which we know Joanne contributed 395 and the sister contributed 60. With this information, we can determine how many apples Joanne’s sister gathered from the shortest trees.\n\nLastly, we can then determine how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees."

Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister from the tallest trees:\n    - Twice as many as Joanne gathered from the tallest trees: 2 * 30 apples = 60 apples \n\n3. Calculate the number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister from the shortest trees:\n    - Since the total number of apples is 500 and Joanne gathered 395, and her sister gathered 60 from the tallest trees, \n    - The number of apples her sister gathered from the shortest trees = total apples - Joanne's apples - sister's tallest tree apples\n    - = 500 apples - 395 apples - 60 apples\n\n4.
