Add the cost of the tablet and the headphones: $3500 + $330 + $137 = $3967\n3. Subtract the total cost of the items from the amount the electronics seller received: $4000 - $3967 = $33\n\nSo, the seller will give back $33 in change."

Both used the prices and quantities provided in the problem without making any assumptions, ensuring an accurate solution. The arithmetic was correctly executed, with the total cost of the phones, tablet, and headphones subtracted from the total amount given to find the change.\n\nThe consistent results from both agents confirm the accuracy of the solution.
