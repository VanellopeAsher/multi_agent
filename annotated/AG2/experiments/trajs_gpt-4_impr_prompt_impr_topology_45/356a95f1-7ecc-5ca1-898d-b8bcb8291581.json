Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam.\n\nThis can be set up as a simple linear equation where:\n- The total amount of fence is equal to the amount Sam gets plus the amount Harry gets.\n- We know that the amount Harry gets is 80 feet more than Sam.\n\nSo, if we let x be the amount Sam gets, then Harry gets x+80.\n\nIt follows that:\n- x + x + 80 = 200\n\nThis allows us to solve for x, which will tell us how much Sam gets."
