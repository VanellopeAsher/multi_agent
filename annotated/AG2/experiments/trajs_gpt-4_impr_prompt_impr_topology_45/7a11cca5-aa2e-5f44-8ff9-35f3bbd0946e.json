We're told this is 4000 gallons.\n\n2. Next, we find out how much water passes through the river after a day of heavy rain. The problem tells us this amount doubles what we have on a normal day, meaning it's 4000 gallons * 2  = 8000 gallons.\n\n3. For the third day, we are given the total volume of water that passes through the river. This quantity is specified as 14000 gallons.\n\n4. To find the increase in the amount of water on the third day, we would subtract the total water volume of the second day from the total volume of the third day. Thus, the increase would be 14000 gallons - 8000 gallons.\n\n5.
