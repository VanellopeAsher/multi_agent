Translate the problem into algebraic expressions.\n        \n    Let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as \"x\". \n    \n    According to the problem, Smendrick has 4 times the cards that PJ has. We can write this as: Smendrick has 4x cards.\n               \n    It is also stated that Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick. So Becca has 4x + 15 cards.\n    \n2. Create an equation to represent the total.\n    \n    If we add up all the cards that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ has, we should get the total number of cards, which is 447. \n    So, if the sum of numbers of cards of Becca, Smendrick and PJ is equal to 447, we can form the following equation:\n\n                4x + 15 (Becca's cards) + 4x (Smendrick's cards) + x (PJ's cards) = 447\n    \n3. Solve the equation and find the value for x.\n\n4. Calculate the number of cards Becca has with the value of x which can be done by substituting x into the equation 4x + 15.\n\n5. Verify that the solution is correct by substituting x back into the original equation and confirming that the left hand side equals the right hand side, which is 447. \n\nNow, let`s ask Agent Code Executor to perform the calculations."

To verify this manually:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cards for each person using the found value of x=48. This means that:\n- PJ has 48 cards\n- Smendrick has 4*48=192 cards\n- Becca has 4*48+15=207 cards\n2. Ensure that these values add up to the total given in the problem, 447 cards.
