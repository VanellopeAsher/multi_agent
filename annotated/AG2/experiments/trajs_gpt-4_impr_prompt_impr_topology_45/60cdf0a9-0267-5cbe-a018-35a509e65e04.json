Next, calculate how many muffin crayons Kate can make. For this, divide the total number of crayons by 8 (since she melts 8 small pieces to make each muffin crayon).\n\n3. After this, calculate the price per muffin crayon. For this, divide the total money she made ($36) by the total number of muffin crayons she made.\n\nThese steps will give us the price per muffin crayon."

So, we need to divide the total crayons by 8 to get the total number of muffin crayons.\n\n3. Then, we'll calculate the price per muffin crayon by dividing the total money Kate made ($36) by the total number of muffin crayons.\n\n```python\n# total number of boxes\ntotal_boxes = 3\n\n# number of crayons per box\ncrayons_per_box = 64\n\n# total crayons\ntotal_crayons = total_boxes * crayons_per_box\n\n# number of crayon pieces needed to make a muffin crayon\npieces_per_muffin = 8\n\n# total muffin crayons\ntotal_muffin_crayons = total_crayons / pieces_per_muffin\n\n# total money made\ntotal_money = 36\n\n# price per muffin crayon\nprice_per_muffin = total_money / total_muffin_crayons\n\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent_Code_Executor"
