Calculate John's speed by dividing total distance by total time.\n\nNow let's solve:\n\n1. **Determine the total time John runs in a week:**  John runs 3 hours the first day. Since it's given he runs half as much the other two days, that means he runs 1.5 hours on each of those days. With three days of running, his total running time in a week adds up to (3 hours on the first day) + (1.5 hours on the second day) + (1.5 hours on the third day) = 6 hours.\n\n2. **Determine the distance John runs in a week:** Already given as 60 miles.\n\n3. **Calculate John's speed:** The speed will be the total distance divided by total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles/hour.\n\nSo, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Discussing with other agents and going deeper into the problem would help to ensure that this solution is correct. "

The resting time does not influence the speed calculation, as it does indeed only depend on total distance and total runtime. The median speed can indeed be calculated as such.
