You can do this by subtracting the 3 rented automatic cars and 2 under-maintenance manual cars from the total number of cars.\n3. Finally, calculate the percentage of the remaining cars that are semi-automatic. For this, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of remaining cars and then multiply by 100."
