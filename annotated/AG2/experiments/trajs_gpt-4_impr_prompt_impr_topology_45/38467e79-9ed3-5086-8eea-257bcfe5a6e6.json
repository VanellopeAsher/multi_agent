We also know that 30 students do not have a desktop computer at home.\n\nWe are asked to determine the total number of students at that grade level.\n\nGiven that the 30 students represent the remaining 1/3 of the total number of students (since 2/3 of them have desktop computers at home), we should be able to determine the total number of students by multiplying the number of students who do not have desktop computers by 3.\n\nHere are the steps to follow to solve this problem:\n\n1. Determine the fraction that represents the students without computers. If 2/3 of students have computers, then 1/3 of students do not.\n2. Use this fraction to find the total number of students. Given that 30 students make up the 1/3 without desktop computers, the total number of students can be found by multiplying these 30 students by 3.\n\nThus, the total number of students at that grade level is 30 * 3 = 90 students."
