      "content": "Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n  1. First, let's tackle the solo song. Sean has to memorize 54 lines.\n  \n  2. For the first scene, we know it has twice the number of lines as the solo song, i.e. 2 * 54  = 108 lines. However, only a third of those lines are Sean's. Therefore, the lines Sean has to memorize for the first scene are 108 / 3 = 36 lines. \n  \n  3. Now, let's look at the second scene. The problem states that the scene has six more lines than the song. That would be 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Also, we're told that 4/5 of these lines are Sean's. Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines. \n  \n  4. Additionally, Sean has to memorize 15 lines due to an absent actor.\n\n  5. Adding up all of Sean's lines from the one song, two scenes and the additional lines due to the absent actor would give the total lines Sean has to memorize. Therefore, the number of lines Sean has to memorize total = 54 (from song) + 36 (from first scene) + 48 (from second scene) + 15 (additional lines) = 153 lines.\n\nSo Sean has to memorize 153 lines total."

Calculate the total number of lines in the first scene which is twice the number of lines in the solo song, and then calculate Sean's lines which is a third of the total lines in the scene. Store this value in a variable `first_scene`.\n  \n  3. Calculate the total number of lines in the second scene which is six more than the number of lines in the solo song, then calculate Sean's lines which are four-fifths of the total. Also add the extra lines because of the absent actor. Store this in a variable `second_scene`.\n  \n  4.
