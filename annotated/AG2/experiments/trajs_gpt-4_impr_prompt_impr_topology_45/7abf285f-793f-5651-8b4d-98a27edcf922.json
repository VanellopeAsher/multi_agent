      "content": "To find out how much Jessica pays for her debts in a year, we need to execute the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the minimum payment: Add up the minimum payments for Jessica's student loan, credit card, and mortgage. The total sums up to $300/month (student loans) + $200/month (credit card) + $500/month (mortgage) = $1000/month.\n\n2. Calculate the amount Jessica desires to pay: Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts. So, 50% of $1000 is $500. Hence, she aims to pay $1000/month (minimum payment) +  $500/month (additional payment) = $1500/month.\n\n3. Calculate the total monthly payments: As she continues to pay for her Netflix subscription, her total monthly expenses would be $1500 (loan payments) + $15 (Netflix). Subtract the coupon value from this to get the final monthly payments.\n\n4. Calculate the annual payment: Multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to get the annual payment.\n\nFollowing this approach one step at a time will help us reach the correct solution."
