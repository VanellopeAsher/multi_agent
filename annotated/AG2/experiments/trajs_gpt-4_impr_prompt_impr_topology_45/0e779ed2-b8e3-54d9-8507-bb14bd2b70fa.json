First, calculate the age of the sisters: \"All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten.\" This means that each sister is 1.6 * 10 = 16 years old. Since there are 3 sisters, their total age is 16 * 3 = 48 years.\n\n2. Next, calculate the age of the younger brother: \"One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old.\" This means the younger brother is 20 * (3/5) = 12 years old.\n\n3. Then, find the age of the older brother: \"One of the brothers is half the age of the older brother.\" So, this means the older brother is 2 * 12 = 24 years old.\n\n4. Lastly, sum the ages of all 5 siblings to find the total: 48 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 84 years.\n\nSo, the total age of all these siblings is 84 years."

To evaluate this, we perform the calculation 1.6 times 10, which equals 16 years. Hence, each sister is 16 years old. Since there are 3 sisters, we multiply this age by 3 to get a total of 48 years for the sisters.\n\nStep 2: Determining the Age of the Younger Brother\nThe problem states that \"one of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old\". To find this value, we perform the multiplication 3/5 times 20, which gives us 12. Thus, the younger brother is 12 years old.\n\nStep 3: Determining the Age of the Older Brother\nThe problem states that the younger brother is \"half the age of the older brother\". Since the younger brother is 12 years old, we double this age to find the age of the older brother, resulting in 24 years.\n\nStep 4: Adding Up the Ages\nThe final step is to add the age of the sisters (48 years), the younger brother (12 years), and the older brother (24 years). This results in a total of 84 years for the siblings.\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."

Adding 48 (the total age of the sisters), 12 (the age of the younger brother), and 24 (the age of the older brother) together, gives you a total of 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years. \n\nThus, the total age of all these siblings is 84 years."
