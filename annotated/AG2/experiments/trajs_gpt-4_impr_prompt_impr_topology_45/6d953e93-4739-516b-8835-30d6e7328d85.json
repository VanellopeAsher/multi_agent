The total income from Thursday would be 60(6) + 40(4) = $600.\n\nSince the mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, the total income from Friday would be $600 - $40 = $560.\n\nFrom the information provided, we know that the only source of income on Friday was from the repaired car tires. Each car tire repair is charged $40. \n\nTherefore, if we divide the total income from Friday by the cost per car tire repair, we can find the number of car tires that were repaired on Friday. This gives us: $560/$40 = 14\n\nSo, the mechanic repaired 14 car tires on Friday."
