So, there are 2000 / 2 = 1000 robots.\n    - The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. So, there are 2 * 2000 = 4000 footballs.\n\n2. Sum the quantities of each item to calculate the total number of items:\n    - 2000 (helmets) + 1000 (robots) + 4000 (footballs)  = 7000 items. \n\nSo, Dominick saw a total of 7000 items."
