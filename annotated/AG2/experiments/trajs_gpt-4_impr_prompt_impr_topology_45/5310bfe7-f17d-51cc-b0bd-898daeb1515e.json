The statement \"Richie, the first teenager, scored 30 more goals than Mark\" implies that Mark scored 90 - 30 = 60 goals.\n2. The statement \"Richie...scored 55 more goals than Anna\" implies that Anna scored 90 - 55 = 35 goals.\n3. Adding all these together gives us the total number of goals: 90(Richie) + 60(Mark) + 35(Anna)  = 185 goals. \n\nSo, all three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals. \n\nOver to you, Agent Code Executor. You might want to confirm this with some Python code."
