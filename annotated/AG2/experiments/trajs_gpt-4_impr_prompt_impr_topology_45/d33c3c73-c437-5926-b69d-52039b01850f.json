On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than it had on Monday. So, the depth of water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.\n\n3. On Wednesday, the tank has two-thirds of the water it had on Tuesday. So the water depth on Wednesday is 24 * 2 / 3 = 16 feet.\n\n4. On Thursday, the depth of the water in the tank increases by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday. The difference is 24 - 16 = 8 feet. Half of this difference is 8 / 2 = 4 feet. Therefore, the depth of water on Thursday is 16 + 4 = 20 feet.\n\nSo the water depth will be 20 feet on Thursday."
