      "content": "Here is a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we calculate the total amount that Stephen owes his sister excluding his coin purchases. Initially, he borrowed $300 and had promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. This 2% of $300 is calculated by (2/100)*300 = $6. So the total amount he owes his sister is $300 + $6 = $306.\n\n2. Second, we evaluate how much he pays his sister in 11 months. Stephen will give his sister $25 per month for 11 months which is calculated  by 25*11 = $275.\n\n3. Finally, we find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month. Stephen has already paid $275 in 11 months, and he owes a total of $306. So in the twelfth month, he will pay the difference between what he owes and what he has already paid which is calculated by 306 - 275 = $31.\n\nSo Stephen will pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month excluding his coin purchases."
