First, find out how many rows Jackson can plant of each color of tulips by dividing the number of each color he has by the number that fits in each row.\n\nFor red tulips: \n   Jackson has 36 red tulips, and he can fit 6 in a row, so he can plant 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.\n   \nFor blue tulips:\n   Jackson has 24 blue tulips, and he can fit 8 in a row, so he can plant 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n   \nFor yellow tulips:\n   Jackson has 30 yellow tulips, and he can fit 5 in a row, so he can plant 30 / 5 = 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n\n2. Add these numbers together to find the total number of rows Jackson will plant. \n   The total number of rows is 6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 6 (yellow) = 15 rows. \n\nSo Jackson will plant 15 total rows of flowers."
