      "content": "Here's how I would approach solving this problem:\n\n1. We start by calculating the total age of all the sisters. Since we know that all 10 sisters are 16 years old, their combined age would be 10 * 16 = 160 years.\n\n2. Next, finding the total age of the two brothers. We know that one of the brothers is 12 years old, and this age is half the age of the older brother. That makes the older brother twice as old as the younger one, so he must be 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n\n3. Now, we add these ages together to get the total age of all the siblings. Summing 160 (the total age of all the sisters), 12 (the age of the younger brother), and 24 (the age of the older brother), we get 160 + 12 + 24 = 196 years.\n\nSo,  the total age of all these siblings should be 196 years."

Finally, we'll sum these values to get the total age of all the siblings. \n\n```python\n# Number of sisters\nnum_sisters = 10 \n\n# Age of each sister\nage_sister = 16 \n\n# Age of younger brother\nage_younger_bro = 12 \n\n# Determine total age of sisters\ntotal_age_sisters = num_sisters * age_sister \n\n# Determine age of older brother\nage_older_bro = 2 * age_younger_bro \n\n# Compute total age of siblings\ntotal_age_siblings = total_age_sisters + age_older_bro + age_younger_bro\n```\n\nLet's see if this yields the expected result."
