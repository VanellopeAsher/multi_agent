This involves figuring out the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th, and then factoring in the days off (which constitute 20% of the total days).\n\n2. Determine the total number of hours Billy worked during this period. Given that he works for 3 hours a day, this will involve multiplying the total number of working days by 3.\n\n3. Figure out the number of people Billy helps per hour. This will be done by dividing the total number of people he helped (in this case, 240 people) by the total number of hours he worked.\n\nLet me run through the calculations in detail next."

Based on the code execution by Agent Code Executor with Python, the result is 2. This means - according to their solution - Billy helps 2 people per hour.\n\nNext, I will compare the two given solutions, taking into account any possible assumptions or inaccuracies.\n\nLooking at the problem, there are no variables that have been assumedâ€”the problem statement provides all necessary variables explicitly. Agent Problem Solver correctly outlined the solution without assuming any values. Likewise, Agent Code Executor provided a Python solution aligning with the problem statement without assumptions.\n\nGiven that both methods yielded the same result and there were no erroneous assumptions or inaccuracies, the correct answer appears to be that Billy helps 2 people per hour.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2.0}**."
