You then calculate the total cost of the non-food items: 3 dollars for light bulbs, 3 dollars for cups, and 4 dollars for roach traps. This adds up to a total of 10 dollars.\n\n3. Because there is a 10% tax on non-food items only, you calculate 10% of the total cost of the non-food items. This will be your tax amount.\n\n4. You then add the tax to the total cost of the non-food items. This will be the total amount John has to pay for the non-food items.\n\n5. Next, you calculate the total cost of the food items: 2 dollars for milk, 3 dollars for eggs, 2 dollars for cookies, and 1 dollar for water. This adds up to a total of 8 dollars.\n\n6. Lastly, to find out the total John had to pay for both food and non-food items, you add the totals from step 4 and step 5. This will give you the total amount John had to pay."
