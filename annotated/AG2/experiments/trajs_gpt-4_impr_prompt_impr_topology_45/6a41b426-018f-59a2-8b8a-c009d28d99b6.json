Among these three days, he runs the same distance on two days, and half that distance on the third day. The question asks for his speed which we cannot compute because we don't have information about his time spent running. \n\nHowever, we can calculate how much distance he runs on each day. \n\nHere is how I would go about solving for that:\n\n1. Let's denote the distance John runs on the two days as `x`. Since he runs half as much the other day, the distance he runs on the third day is `0.5x`.\n2. From the problem, we know that the total distance John runs in a week is 60 miles or `x + x + 0.5x = 60`.\n3. Now, we can solve this equation to find `x`. Once `x` is found, the distance John runs on the third day is `0.5x`."

The total distance run in a week is 60 miles.\n\nWe'll denote the distance John runs each of the two days as x (miles). The distance run the third day is then half of that, or 0.5 * x. \n\nThe total distance run in the three days is therefore 2*x + 0.5*x = 60 miles. Simplifying it gives us 2.5*x = 60.\n\nWe can solve this equation to find x, the distance John typically runs in a day. We can then find the distance run on the third day by halving x.\n\nLet's do the computation now."
