Calculate the total amount Gerald earned from babysitting: He babysat for 2 hours each day for 7 days at a rate of $0. This means he made no money from babysitting.\n\n3. Determine how much Gerald spent on necessities: According to the problem, Gerald spent a total of $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n\n4.

Calculating the total amount earned: both agents deducted that Gerald's total earnings from the daycare job is indeed $210 since his daily wage is $30 and he worked for 7 days. Moreover, they recognized that although Gerald did provide babysitting services, he wasn't compensated for it.\n\n2. Calculating the total expenditure: both agents identified that Gerald spent a total of $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n\n3. Finally, calculating the remaining amount: both agents correctly subtracted the total expenditure from the total earnings to arrive at the final amount which is indeed $110.
