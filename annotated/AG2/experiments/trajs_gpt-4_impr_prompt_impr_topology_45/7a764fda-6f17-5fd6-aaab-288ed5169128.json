      "content": "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1. Since the price increased by 80% in December, this means it increased from its original value of $4000. To work out what the increased price is, we multiply the original price by 80% (or 0.8) and then add this to the original price. $4000 * 0.8 = $3200. This is the amount it increased by, so we add this to the original price to get the new price: $4000 + $3200 = $7200.\n\n2. For the discount in January, we need to reduce the price by 50%. To do this we multiply the December price by 50% or 0.5. So, $7200 * 0.5 = $3600.\n\nTherefore, if the toy was discounted by 50% in January after the price increase of 80% in December, the price of the toy would be $3600."
