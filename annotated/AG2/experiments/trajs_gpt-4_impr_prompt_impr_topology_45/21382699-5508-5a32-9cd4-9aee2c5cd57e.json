Since Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can represent Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where 'x' is a constant.\n\n2. Given that the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, we can form an equation as: 7x + 11x = 162.\n\n3. Solve this equation to find the value of 'x'. \n\n4. After finding 'x', substitute it into the expression for Allen's age (which is 11x) to find Allen's current age.\n\n5. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age.\n\nNote: The ratio of their height does not affect the calculation of Allen's age and is not relevant to this problem."
