      "content": "Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any discount or cash back. Each gallon costs $3.00, so 10 gallons would cost $3.00 * 10 = $30.00.\n\n2. Next, calculate the total amount of cash back the person gets from the app. The app offers $0.20 cash back per gallon, so total cash back for 10 gallons would be $0.20 * 10 = $2.00. \n\n3. We should then subtract the cash back from the total cost of the gas to get the cost after cash back. So, the cost of gas after cash back is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.\n\n4.  Now, we should apply the coupon for a 10% discount. A 10% discount on $28.00 is $28.00 * 0.10 = $2.80.\n\n5.  Finally, subtract the discount from the price after cash back to get the final cost. The final cost of the gas is $28.00 - $2.80 = $25.20.\n\nSo, after applying both the cashback and the coupon, the person will pay $25.20 for the gas."
