Therefore, multiply 5 classes by 5 days to get the total classes from Monday through Friday. Add to this the 8 classes she teaches on Saturday. She doesn't teach on Sunday, so this is how many classes she teaches in a week.\n   \n2. **Calculate total students in a week**: Each class has 15 students. Therefore, multiply the total number of classes in a week( from step 1) by 15 to get the total students in a week.\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings in a week**: Judy charges $15 per student for each class. Therefore, multiply the total students in a week (from step 2) by $15 to get the total earnings in a week.\n   \nRemember, the free 5-minute warm-up session doesn't affect her earnings and therefore doesn't need to be considered in the calculations. This ensures we are only calculating her earnings."
