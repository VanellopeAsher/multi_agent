So, the total becomes 80 - 2 = 78.\n\nStep 5: On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 78 - 21 = 57 passengers on the bus.\n\nStep 6: Then, 3 times fewer passengers than those who got off get on the bus. So, the number of new passengers is 21 / 3 = 7 and the total becomes 57 + 7 = 64.\n\nSo, 64 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop. Please correct me if I made a mistake in my calculations. Thank you."
