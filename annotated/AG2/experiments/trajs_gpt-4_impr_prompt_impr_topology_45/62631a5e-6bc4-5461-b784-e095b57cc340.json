This total is `700 corn chips/person * 2 people = 1400 corn chips`\n\nThe problem also states that Collins got 150 more corn chips than what Amora and Lainey got. If Amora and Lainey each got 700 corn chips, then Collins got `700 corn chips + 150 corn chips = 850 corn chips`\n\nTo find the total number of corn chips, we therefore add the number that Amora and Lainey got to the number that Collins got. The total becomes `1400 corn chips + 850 corn chips = 2250 corn chips`\n\nSo altogether there were 2250 corn chips."
