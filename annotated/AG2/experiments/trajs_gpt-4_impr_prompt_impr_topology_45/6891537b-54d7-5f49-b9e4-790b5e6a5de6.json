Then, calculate the total number of baseball cards Maria has. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards each, so 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards\n3. Now, add up these totals to find out how many cards in total Miss Maria has: 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards\n4. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards and gives the rest to her students. So subtract the 50 cards she kept from the total: 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards\n5. Each student gets 10 cards. So divide the total number of cards by the number of cards each student gets to find the number of students: 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students\n\nSo, Miss Maria has 30 students."
