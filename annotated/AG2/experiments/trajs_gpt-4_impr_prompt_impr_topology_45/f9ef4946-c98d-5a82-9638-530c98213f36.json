      "content": "Here is how to solve this problem:\n\n1. On Mondays and Tuesdays, Frankie watches an hour of TV each night. That adds 1 hour * 2 days = 2 hours.\n\n2. On Wednesday, Frankie watched three 30-minute episodes. Since one hour contains 60 minutes, three 30-minute episodes equate to 3 * 30 minutes = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours.\n\n3. On Thursday, Frankie watched one hour of episodes and an extra 30-minute show. This totals 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.\n\n4. On Friday, Frankie watched two one-hour episodes, which amounts to 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\nFinally, to get the total amount of TV Frankie watched, add all the hours:\n\n2 hours (Monday + Tuesday)\n+ 1.5 hours (Wednesday)\n+ 1.5 hours (Thursday)\n+ 2 hours (Friday)\n= 7 hours"

After calculating the hours for each day out and summing them up, we get the total as 7 hours. \n\nNow, let's execute this code and get the final result. \nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

Adding all these times together gives a total of 7 hours.\n\nBy verifying the calculations step by step, I can confirm that all steps are valid, and the methods employed by both agents are accurate.
