Therefore, we have 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of shells collected by the boys. As each boy collected 60 shells, 10 boys would have collected a total of (10 * 60) = 600 shells.\n\nStep 3: The girls collected an amount equal to the boys' total (\"600 shells\") plus \"4.5 times as many as the boys brought\". Therefore, the girls collected (1 * 600) + (4.5 * 600) = 600 + 2700 = 3300 shells.\n\nStep 4: As there are 10 girls, the number of shells brought by each girl is 3300 / 10 = 330 shells.\n\nTherefore, each girl brought back 330 seashells."

      "content": "To solve this problem using Python code, follow these steps:\n\n    1. Assign 20 to the variable `total_kids`\n    2. Divide `total_kids` by 2 to find the number of boys and girls (`boys = girls = total_kids//2`). We can use integer division `//` because we know the total number of kids can be evenly divided by 2\n    3. Compute the total number of shells brought by the boys (`total_boys_shells = boys * 60`)\n    4. Compute the total number of shells brought by the girls. Since the girls brought as many shells as the boys plus 4.5 times as many as the boys brought, we compute `total_girls_shells = (1+4.5)*total_boys_shells`\n    5. Find the number of shells each girl brought by dividing `total_girls_shells` by the number of girls. Let's store the result in the variable `shells_per_girl`\n\nNow, we can write and execute the Python code.\n\n```python\n# assign 20 to total_kids\ntotal_kids = 20\n# compute number of boys and girls\nboys = girls = total_kids // 2\n# compute total number of shells brought by boys\ntotal_boys_shells = boys * 60\n# compute total number of shells brought by girls\ntotal_girls_shells = (1 + 4.5) * total_boys_shells\n# compute number of shells brought by each girl\nshells_per_girl = total_girls_shells / girls\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

They have correctly determined that the total number of kids was divided equally into girls and boys, which means there are 10 girls and 10 boys. According to the problem, each boy collected 60 seashells, so collectively they gathered 600 seashells. The girls collected an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times what the boys collected, which totals 3300 seashells. When this total is divided by the number of girls, we find that each girl collected 330 seashells. \n\nI confirm the accuracy of this solution. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{330}."
