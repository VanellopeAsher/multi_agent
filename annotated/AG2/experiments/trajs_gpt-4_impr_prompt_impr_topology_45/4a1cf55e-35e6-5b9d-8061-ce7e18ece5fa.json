According to the problem, the gallon jar costs $2.5 more than the half-gallon jar. Knowing that the gallon jar costs $5.5, we can set up the following equation to find the price of the half-gallon jar: 5.5 - 2.5 = $3. \nSo, a half-gallon jar costs $3.\n\n2. Next, find the total cost for the gallon jars by multiplying the price of one gallon by the number of gallons: 5.5 * 10 = $55.\n\n3. Then find the total cost for the half-gallon jars by multiplying the price of a half-gallon jar by the number of half-gallons: 3 * 16 = $48.\n\n4. Finally, add the totals to find the overall cost: 55 + 48 = $103.\n\nTherefore, Cecelia spent $103 on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars."
