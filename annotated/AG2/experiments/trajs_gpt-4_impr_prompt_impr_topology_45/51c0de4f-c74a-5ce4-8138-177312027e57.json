The total is 500 (from neighbors) + 1500 (from the online fund) = 2000 dollars.\n2. Walter's lawyer offered to donate three times as much as everyone else, which sums up to 3 * 2000 = 6000 dollars.\n3. Now, let's subtract the total amount donated by the lawyer from the total amount he gave. So we have 6600 (the overall amount given by the lawyer) - 6000 (the tripled sum he promised to match). This leaves us with $600, which must be the amount donated by Walter's friend."
