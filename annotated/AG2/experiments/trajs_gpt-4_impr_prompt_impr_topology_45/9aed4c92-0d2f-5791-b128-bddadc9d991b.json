      "content": "Here's my approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. Identify the amount of money Mark currently has, which is $50.5.\n2. Identify the amount of money Mark earns per day at work, which is $12.5.\n3. Identify the cost of the bike Mark wants to purchase, which is $300.5.\n4. The total amount of money Mark needs to save to purchase the bike will be the cost of the bike minus the current money he has saved. We can represent it as a formula: Needed Money = Bike Cost - Current Money\n5. Having identified how much more money Mark needs to save, the next step is to determine how many days he needs to work in order to save that amount. Since we know how much Mark earns per day, we divide the needed money by daily earnings to get the number of days he needs to work. This can be formulated as: Days needed = Needed Money/Daily Earnings\n6. If the division result is a fraction, we round up to the nearest whole number of days as you can't work a fraction of a day.\n7. This will give us the number of days Mark needs to work and save in order to buy the bike. \n\nLet's execute these steps with the provided information."
