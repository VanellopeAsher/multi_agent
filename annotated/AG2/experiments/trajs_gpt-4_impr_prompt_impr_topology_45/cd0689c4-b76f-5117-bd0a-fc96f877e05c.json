That's a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 presents.\n\nShe has 144 inches of ribbon to allocate among all the presents. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can allocate for each present's bow, she would need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of presents.\n\nSo, the solution would be:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of presents, which we've already done (12 presents). \nStep 2: Divide the total length of the ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of presents (12 presents). This will give us the length in inches of ribbon that can be allocated to each present's bow. Let's call this value R. So, R = 144 inches / 12 presents.\n\nNow, we need to do the calculation for Step 2 to find the actual length."
