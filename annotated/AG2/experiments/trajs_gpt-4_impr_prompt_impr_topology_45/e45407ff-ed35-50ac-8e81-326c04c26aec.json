Calculate how many bottles of cognac John buys.\n4. Find the total cost of cognac.\n5. Sum the total costs of scotch and cognac to find the total spending.\n\nLet's start solving it.\n\nStep 1: Find out the cost of one bottle of scotch.\n   * If 10 bottles cost $600, then one bottle costs $600 ÷ 10 = $60.\n\nStep 2: Determine the cost of one bottle of cognac.\n   * We are told that one bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a scotch bottle. Therefore, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + (50% of $60) = $60 + $30 = $90.\n\nStep 3: Calculate how many bottles of cognac John buys.\n   * John buys twice as many cognac bottles as scotch bottles. Therefore, John buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n\nStep 4: Find the total cost of the cognac.\n   * If one bottle of cognac costs $90, then 20 bottles cost $90 × 20 = $1800.\n\nFinally, one can find John's total spending by summing the total costs of the scotch and the cognac. That is $600 (for scotch) + $1800 (for cognac) = $2400. Therefore, John spends $2400 in total."
