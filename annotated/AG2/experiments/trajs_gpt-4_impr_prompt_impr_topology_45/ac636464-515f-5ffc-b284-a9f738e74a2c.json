Find out how long James swims during the first part of his journey by dividing the traveled distance by his speed.\n3. Determine the resting time by taking half of the initial swimming time.\n4. Solve how far is left to swim by subtracting the initial swim from the total distance.\n5. Work out the time it takes to swim the second part of the journey by dividing the remaining distance by the new speed (which is half of the initial speed).\n6. Lastly, add all the time durations (swim part 1, rest, swim part 2) to find the total time it took for James to cross the lake."
