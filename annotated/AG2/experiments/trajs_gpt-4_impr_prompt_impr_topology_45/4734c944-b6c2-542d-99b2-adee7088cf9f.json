Determine how much he spends each day: Since Peter wants to spend an equal amount each day, divide his total money ($70) by 7 days in a week.\n\n2. Identify how many action figures he can buy in the first half of the week: From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures, each at $5. To find out how many he can buy with his daily allowance, we divide his daily spending by the price of a wooden action figure.\n\n3. Compute the total number of wooden action figures: Multiply the number of action figures he can buy per day by 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday). \n\n4. Identify how many action figures he can buy in the second half of the week: For the rest of the week (i.e., Thursday through Saturday), Peter buys plastic action figures, each at $2.5. To determine how many he can buy with his daily allowance, we divide his daily spending by the price of a plastic action figure.\n\n5. Calculate the total number of plastic action figures: Multiply the number of action figures he can buy per day by 3 days (Thursday through Saturday).\n\n6.
