Given, at the end of the game 12 balloons were left.\n\nSo to determine the number of balloons they threw, we need to subtract the number of remaining balloons from the total number of balloons.\n\nThe python code to solve for this would be as follows:\n\n```python\n# Initialize number of balloons per pack and remaining balloons\nballoons_per_pack = 30\nremaining_balloons = 12\n\n# Assume number of packs (P). This can be any number greater than zero\nnumber_of_packs = 3\n\n# Calculate total no of balloons \ntotal_balloons = number_of_packs * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Calculate thrown balloons\nthrown_balloons = total_balloons - remaining_balloons\n\n# print the result\nprint(thrown_balloons)\n```\n\nThis code will print the number of balloons that were thrown. It can be used regardless of the number of packs P, as long as P is greater than zero. Note that you can replace the value of number_of_packs with the actual number of packs used in the game. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor\n\nCan you try running this code?"
