To do this, we multiply the number of packets of celery seeds she bought (80) by the price per packet ($30).\n\nStep 2: Once we have the total spent on celery seeds, we subtract this amount from the total amount spent on all seeds ($3200). This will give us the total amount spent on tomato seeds.\n\nStep 3: Finally, to calculate the number of packets of tomato seeds purchased, we divide the total amount spent on tomato seeds by the price per packet of tomato seeds ($40).\n\nLet's discuss this approach with the other agents."

Each step will be laid out separately in the code.\n\nLet's look at the commented code now."
