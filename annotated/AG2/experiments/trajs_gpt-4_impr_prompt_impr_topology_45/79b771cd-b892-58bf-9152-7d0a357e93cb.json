However, she must stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames, which is at a distance of 10000 feet.\n\nThe distance beyond the reach of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is the difference between the distance she can throw the javelin (with the gemstone) and the reach of the dragon's flames, which is 12000 feet - 10000 feet = 2000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand as far as 2000 feet from the outer edge of the dragon's flames range and still hit the dragon."

Finally, the difference between the two gives us the safe distance outside the reach of the dragon’s flames where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. Both solutions correctly identified these steps and came to the correct answer of 2000 feet.\n\nA job excellently done, agents. Have a very pleasant day!"
