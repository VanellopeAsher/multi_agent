Calculate Tim's points: Bella has 78 points and Tim has 40 points less than Bella, so Tim would have 78 - 40 = 38 points.\n\n3. Calculate Mary's points: Mary has three times more points than Tim, so Mary would have 38 points * 3 = 114 points.\n\n4. Calculate the total points collected by the class: The total points would be the sum of the points collected by Antony, Bella, Tim, and Mary: 60 + 78 + 38 + 114 = 290 points.\n\n5. Calculate the points missing for the field trip: The class needs 500 points minimum to go on the field trip. Since they've collected 290 points so far, they would need 500 - 290 = 210 points more to reach the minimum threshold.\n\nSo, the class is missing 210 points to go on the field trip."
