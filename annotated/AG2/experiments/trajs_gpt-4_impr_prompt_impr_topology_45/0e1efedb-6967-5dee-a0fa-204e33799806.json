Next, we subtract $7, the value of the discount voucher, from the sum obtained in step 1. \n\n3. The result will give us the total amount of money that your mother spent at the garden store. \n\nLet's perform these calculations now."

Here we first define values for the prices of the pots and the soil bag, and for the voucher. We then calculate the total price before discount by summing the price of the pots and the bag, and we calculate the final total spent by subtracting the voucher value from the total cost before discount. Consequently, executing this Python code will give us the total amount your mother spent at the garden store."
