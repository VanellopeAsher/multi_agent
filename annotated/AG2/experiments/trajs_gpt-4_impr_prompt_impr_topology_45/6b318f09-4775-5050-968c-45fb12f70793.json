This can be done by multiplying the number of families with their respective family sizes and adding the results together. For example, Martha invited 12 families of 6 people and 15 families of 4 people, we calculate it like so: (12 * 6) + (15 * 4).\n\n2. Determine the total number of people who couldn't attend the party. This includes people who fell sick and those who had previous commitments. We know that 16 people were sick and that an additional 1/4 of this number had previous commitments.\n\n3. Subtract the total number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of invitees to find out how many people showed up for the party."

Identify the total number of guests who didn't attend: `16 + (16 / 4) = 16 + 4 = 20`.\n3. By subtracting the number of guests who were unavailable from the total invited, we arrive at the number of attendees: `132 - 20 = 112`.\n\nAfter evaluating both solutions, I have confirmed that the Python code executed is correctly aligned with the suggested steps to solve the problem. After the code was executed, the resulting output was `112.0`, which indicates that 112 people attended Martha's party.\n\nHence, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{112}**"
