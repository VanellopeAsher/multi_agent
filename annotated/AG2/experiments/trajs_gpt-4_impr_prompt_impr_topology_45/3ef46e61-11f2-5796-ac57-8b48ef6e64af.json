Convert the duration of each phone call to hours because Tim's work hours are in hours. 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, so each call takes 0.25 hours.\n\n2. Calculate how many calls Tim can handle in a day. This is found by dividing the number of hours he works each day (6) by the duration of each call (0.25). \n\n3. Calculate the total number of calls he can handle from Monday through Thursday. Each of these days, he works for 6 hours. \n\n4. For Friday, we have to put into account the 2 extra hours he works, therefore adding 2 to his regular 6 hours and computing how many calls he can handle in the 8 hours.\n\n5. Add up the total calls from Monday to Thursday and the total calls on Friday to get the total number of calls Tim can handle in one work week. \n\nLet's move to the discussion phase to see if everyone agrees with this approach."

Now, I will evaluate their solutions.\n\nAgent Problem Solver proposed a plan that firstly converts the duration of each phone call into hours because Tim's work hours are in hours. This is done correctly as 15 minutes is indeed a quarter of an hour, or 0.25 hours.\n\nThe solution then calculates how many calls Tim can handle in a usual workday (6 hours) by dividing the number of hours he works each day by the duration of each call. This results in the number of calls he can handle per day.\n\nThe solution then calculates the total number of calls he can handle from Monday through Thursday by multiplying the number of calls per day by 4 (the number of days from Monday to Thursday).\n\nConsidering Friday, when Tim works two extra hours, the plan calculates the number of calls he can handle in 8 hours (6 regular hours plus 2 extra hours). The number of calls on Friday is added to the total from Monday to Thursday to get the total number of calls in a week.\n\nAgent Code Executor implemented this plan in code without any erroneous assumptions and included clear comments to explain each step. The code correctly executes the steps proposed by Agent Problem Solver. It correctly calculates the total calls assuming that each call lasts exactly 15 minutes and that Tim works exactly 6 hours each day, plus an additional 2 hours on Friday.\n\nTherefore, the final solution, based on the proposed solutions, is that Tim can handle 128 calls during his 5-day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday. \n\nHence, SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{128}."
