Given that by doing DIY, Ethan saved 20%, it means the DIY cost represents 80% of the total cost.\n     2. We know that the amount Ethan saved is $200, which is 20% of the original cost.\n     3. To find out the original cost (prior to DIY), we can calculate it as $200 (Ethan's savings) divided by 20% (Amount Saved in one DIY cost) and multiplied by 100%.\n\nHence the original (total) cost can be calculated as:\n\n    total_cost = 200/20*100 \n\n    \nThen, since we know the total cost and the savings, the cost of materials (DIY Cost) would be the difference of the two:\n\n     DIY_cost = total_cost - savings\n     DIY_cost = total_cost - 200\n     \n\nLet's implement this calculation."

They both proposed finding the total cost (before the DIY) by assuming the $200 Ethan saved represents 20% of the total cost. They then subtracted the savings ($200) from this total cost to find the cost of materials. \n\nThe Python code ran by Agent Code Executor calculated the total cost as $1000 ($200 / 20% * 100%), and the cost of the materials as $800 ($1000 - $200).\n\nTherefore, the cost of materials for the DIY wallpaper project, according to the method suggested, is $800.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{800}."
