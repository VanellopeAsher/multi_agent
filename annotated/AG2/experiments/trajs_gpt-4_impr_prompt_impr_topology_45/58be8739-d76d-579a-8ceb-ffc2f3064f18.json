      "content": "The first step is to figure out the total time John spent during his vacation. This can be calculated by understanding that the non-sightseeing activities accounted for 30% of the total time. \n\nHere's how we arrive at the solution:\n\n1. Find out how much time John spent on non-sightseeing activities. We know he spent 6 hours boating and half of that time swimming. That's 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) = 9 hours. He also watched 3 different shows which are 2 hours each.  So that's 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours. Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 9 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours.\n\n2. Since the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows represents 30% of the total time John spent, we can now calculate the  total time by dividing the time spent on these activities by 30% (or 0.3). That's 15 hours / 0.3 = 50 hours.\n\n3. Finally, to find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we subtract the time spent on non-sightseeing activities from the total time. That's 50 hours (total time) - 15 hours (non-sightseeing activities) = 35 hours. \n\nSo, John spent 35 hours sightseeing."

Subtract the time spent on these activities from the total time to find the time spent sightseeing. \n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Time spent on boating\nboating_time = 6 \n\n# Time spent on swimming is half the boating time\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2 \n\n# Time spent on shows, 3 shows 2 hours each\nshows_time = 3 * 2\n\n# Time spent on non-sightseeing activities \nnon_sightseeing_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time \n\n# Non_sightseeing time is 30% of total time\ntotal_time = non_sightseeing_time / 0.3 \n\n# Sightseeing time is total time - non_sightseeing_time\nsightseeing_time = total_time - non_sightseeing_time\n\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the time John spent sightseeing."
