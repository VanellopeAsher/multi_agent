Subtract this total from the total amount Marie paid.\n3. Finally, divide the remaining amount by the cost of a box of pizza to get the number of pizza boxes.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. The cost of one chicken meal is $120.\n2. The cost for 5 packs of milk is 5 * $30 = $150.\n3. The cost for 40 apples is 40 * $1.50 = $60.\n\nAdding these up, we get $120 + $150 + $60 = $330.\nThen, to find out how much Marie paid for the pizzas, we subtract this total from the amount she paid: $900 - $330 = $570.\nFinally, we divide this amount by the cost of a box of pizza to get the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered: $570 / $57 = 10. \n\nHence, Marie ordered 10 boxes of pizza."
