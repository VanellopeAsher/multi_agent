Therefore, the total number of sets of ten questions he completed in the first test is 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4 sets.\nIn the second test, he completed the test at the same rate and he had 0.6 hours. Therefore, the total number of sets he finished in the second test is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 sets.\n\nStep 2: Find out the total number of sets of ten questions Mark was supposed to answer for each test.\nIn the first test, he was supposed to answer 7.5 sets of ten questions and in the second test, he was supposed to answer 10 sets of ten questions. \n\nStep 3: Find out how many sets of ten questions Mark did not complete.\nIn the first test, he completed 0.4 sets out of the total 7.5 sets, so the number of sets he did not complete for the first test is 7.5 - 0.4 = 7.1 sets. \nIn the second test, he completed 0.3 sets out of the total 10 sets, so the number of sets he did not complete for the second test is 10 - 0.3 = 9.7 sets.\n   \nTherefore, the total number of sets of ten questions Mark did not complete is 7.1 + 9.7 = 16.8 sets. His incomplete work consists of 16.8 sets of ten questions."
