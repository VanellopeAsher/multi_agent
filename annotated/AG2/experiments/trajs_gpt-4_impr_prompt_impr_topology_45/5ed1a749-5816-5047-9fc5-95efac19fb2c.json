We can represent it as '3A'.\n\nThe third box set reportedly has 1/4 the number of pieces compared to A. We can represent it as 'A/4'. \n\nAdding these up gives us the total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up:\n\nA + 3A + A/4 will give us the total if the number of blocks in the first box is A. \n\nPlease provide me with the exact number of Lego pieces that Johnny has in the first box set to allow me to provide a numerical solution."

The equation is equating 4.25A (A + 3A + 0.25A) to A, which naturally results in 0 as there are no additional constants in this equation. To determine the total number of blocks, we simply need to calculate 4.25A, however, A is not defined in the question. \n\nCurrently, we can only present the solution as a function of A. Therefore, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 4.25 times the number of blocks in the first box (A).
