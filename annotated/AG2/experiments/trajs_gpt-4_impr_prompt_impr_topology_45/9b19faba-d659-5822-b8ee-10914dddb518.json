First, we determine how many boxes of each product Sunny sold each day. \n\n   On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than he sold on Sunday. Since he sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, he must have sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\n\n   On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.\n\n   On Monday, he sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie.\n\n2. To calculate the total Sunny earned over the three days, we need to multiply the number of boxes sold each day by the cost of the product, and then sum up the earnings for all three days. \n\n   On Saturday, he earned 10 * $6 + 11 * $15 = $60 + $165 = $225.\n\n   On Sunday, he earned 15 * $6 + 15 * $15 = $90 + $225 = $315.\n\n   On Monday, he earned 2 * $6 + 4 * $15 = $12 + $60 = $72.\n\n3. Adding up the total earnings from all three days: $225 + $315 + $72 = $612.\n\nSo, Sunny earned a total of $612 over the three days."
