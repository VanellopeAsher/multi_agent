      "content": "To solve this problem, we are going to use simple algebraic cross-multiplication.\nExample:\nIf 60 potatoes make 360 hash browns, then 1 potato would make (360/60) = 6 hash browns.\nSo, 960 potatoes would make (6 * 960) = 5760 hash browns.\n\nHere are the explicit steps:\n1. Divide the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes to find the proportional ratio of  potatoes to hash browns.  For 60 potatoes making 360 hash browns, the ratio would be 360/60 = 6 hash browns per potato.\n2. Multiply the ratio found in step 1 (6 hash browns per potato) by the number of potatoes we're interested in (960). So, 6 * 960 = 5760 hash browns.\n\nThus, you would be able to make 5760 hash browns out of 960 potatoes."

The solution proposed by Agent Problem Solver is similar in method and results.\n\nThe method followed here was proper and considered the values explicitly given in the problem. It's important to accurately replicate the ratio established originally and use that to predict outcomes with different quantities. It seems both agents followed this correctly.\n\nTherefore, considering both solutions and verifying their proper application and correctness, I can confidently conclude and assert the solution.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{5760} hash browns can be made out of 960 potatoes."
