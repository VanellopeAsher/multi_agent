  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

Total weight of each type of feed:\n   - Sugar cubes: 20 boxes * 10 pounds/box = 200 pounds\n   - Carrots: 40 bags * 120 pounds/bag = 4800 pounds\n   - Hay: 420 bales * 750 pounds/bale = 315000 pounds\n   - Oats: 200 sacks * 650 pounds/sack = 130000 pounds\n\n2. Total feed weight = 200 pounds (sugar cubes) + 4800 pounds (carrots) + 315000 pounds (hay) + 130000 pounds (oats) = 450000 pounds\n\n3. Number of trips = Total feed weight / Weight the truck can carry in one trip = 450000 pounds / 22500 pounds/trip.
