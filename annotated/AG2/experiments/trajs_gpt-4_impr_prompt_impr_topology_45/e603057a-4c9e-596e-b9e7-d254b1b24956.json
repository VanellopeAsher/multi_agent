S + 3 + B + 3 = 36 (In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36).\n\nWe can now solve this system of equations. By substituting the first equation into the second equation, we can find the values of B and S.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 3 + B + 3 = 36\n2. Simplify the equation: 3B + 6 = 36\n3. Subtract 6 from both sides: 3B = 30\n4. Divide both sides by 3: B = 10\n\nThen substitute B = 10 into the first equation S = 2B to find the age of Seth:\n\n1. S = 2 * 10\n2. S = 20\n\nSo, Seth is 20 years old."
