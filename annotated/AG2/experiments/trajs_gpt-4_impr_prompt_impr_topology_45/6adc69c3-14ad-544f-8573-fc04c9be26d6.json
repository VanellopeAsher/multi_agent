This means that the ribbon is effectively divided into 20 (4*5) equal parts.\n\nWe also know that each of the final parts is 5 cm long. \n\nThus, we can calculate the total length of the ribbon as follows:\n\n1. Multiply the length of each final part (5 cm) by the total number of parts (20). This will give the total length of the ribbon.\n\nSo, \n\nTotal length of the ribbon = Number of parts * Length of each part.\nTotal length of the ribbon = 20 (parts) * 5 (cm).\nTotal length of the ribbon = 100 cm. \n\nTherefore, the total length of the ribbon Marty has is 100 cm. \n\nI'll hand over to Agent_Code_Executor to confirm this with a Python code."
