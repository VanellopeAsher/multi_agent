Calculate the cost of toys per month: Since a toy is bought every two months, the monthly cost is $10/2 = $5/month\n3. Add all the monthly costs: $100/month (food) + $20/month (treats) + $100/month (medicine) + $15/month (shampoo) + $5/month (toy) = $240/month\n4. Calculate the annual cost: 12 months/year * $240/month = $2880/year\n\nSo, Madeline spends $2880 on her dog per year."
