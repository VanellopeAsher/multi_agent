We can put the value of P in equation (3) to find S, and then put the value of S in equation (2) to find B. \n\nThis will give us the number of cards Becca has. This final number will be in hundreds as the original problems specifies the total in hundreds. For the total number of cards, we'll simply multiply our result with 100."
