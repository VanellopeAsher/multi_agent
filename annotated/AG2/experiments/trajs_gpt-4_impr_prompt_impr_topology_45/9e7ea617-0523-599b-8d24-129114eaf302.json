Since the shortest tree is 60 feet, the second tree is 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet.\n2. The combined height of the two shorter trees is 60 feet + 110 feet = 170 feet.\n3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so the tallest tree is 2 * 170 feet = 340 feet.\n   \nIn conclusion, the tallest tree is 340 feet tall."
