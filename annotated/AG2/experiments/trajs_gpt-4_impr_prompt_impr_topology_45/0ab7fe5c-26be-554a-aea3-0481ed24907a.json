According to the statement, he's buying:\n\n- 3.6 times of ten red tulips - it means he is buying 3.6 * 10 = 36 red tulips.\n- 2.4 times of ten blue tulips - it means he is buying 2.4 * 10 = 24 blue tulips.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many rows he will plant considering the fact that:\n\n- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, the number of rows for red tulips would be 36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips.\n- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, the number of rows for blue tulips would be 24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n\nFinally, adding up both the rows would give us the total number of rows that Jackson will plant:\n\n- 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows. \n\nTherefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."
