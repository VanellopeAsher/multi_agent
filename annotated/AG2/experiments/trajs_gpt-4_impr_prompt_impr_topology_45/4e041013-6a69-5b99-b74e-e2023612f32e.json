Since Jackson plants 6 red tulips per row, the total number of rows for red tulips would be the total number of red tulips (36) divided by 6. \n2. Similarly, as he plants 8 blue tulips per row, the total number of rows for blue tulips would be the total number of blue tulips (24) divided by 8. \n3. The total number of rows would be the sum of the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips. \n\nLet's calculate the total number of rows."
