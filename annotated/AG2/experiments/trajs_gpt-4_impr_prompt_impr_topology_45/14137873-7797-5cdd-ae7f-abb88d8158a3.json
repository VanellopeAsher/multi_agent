Before the ants took one, there must have been six fries.\n2. Prior to the raccoon taking two thirds of the fries, there must have been three times the amount left afterwards. So before the raccoon came, there should be 3 * 6 = 18 fries.\n3. Before the pigeons ate the fries, there were three more fries for each pigeon, so add 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Hence, before the pigeons came, there should be 18 + 9 = 27 fries.\n4. The seagull ate half the number of fries that Dave ate, which means the amount must have been two times what the seagull ate. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull must have eaten 7 fries. So, before the seagull ate the fries, there must have been 27 + 7 = 34 fries.\n5. Finally, add the 14 fries that Dave ate at the beginning to get the total amount. Therefore, the initial number of fries must have been 14 + 34 = 48. So, Dave initially had 48 fries."

Five fries remained after ants took one away, which meant there were six fries before the ants action.\n2. The raccoon took away two-thirds of the fries, meaning that before the raccoon came, there were three times as many fries, i.e., 6 * 3 = 18 fries.\n3. Each of the three pigeons consumed three fries, so before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 3 * 3 = 27 fries.\n4. The seagull ate half as many fries as Dave did (14), so it ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Therefore, before the seagull ate, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.\n5. Before Dave began eating, he had 14 more fries than there were when the seagull began eating, so the original packet contained 34 + 14 = 48 fries. \n\nThus, the initial packet bought by Dave contained 48 french fries. I will now execute this calculation in Python."
