Volleyball: The problem statement says there are twice the number of students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, which is 6*2 = 12 students playing volleyball.\n   \n3. Soccer: The problem statement says there are some boys and 22 girls. Since it doesn't specify how many boys there are, we will denote the unknown number of boys as 'b'.\n\nSo, the total number of students is the sum of the students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, which is 6(Tennis) + 12(Volleyball) + b(boys in Soccer) + 22(girls in Soccer).\n\nLet's discuss this with the other agents to see if the calculation matches theirs."

We have the number of students playing tennis and we know that the number of students playing volleyball is twice that number. The number of students playing soccer is not given fully; we only have the number of girls. So, we need to add another variable, 'b', for boys, to represent the unknown quantity. In Python, that would look like this:\n\n```python\n# Number of students playing tennis\ntennis = 6\n\n# Number of students playing volleyball (twice the number of tennis players)\nvolleyball = 2 * tennis\n\n# Number of girls playing soccer\ngirls_soccer = 22\n\n# Number of boys playing soccer is unknown, denoted as 'b'\nboys_soccer = Symbol('b')\n\n# Total number of students is the sum of all the students\ntotal_students = tennis + volleyball + girls_soccer + boys_soccer\n\nprint(total_students)\n```\n\nTo solve for the total number of students, we need to know 'b', the number of boys playing soccer. \n\nHowever, if the question is simply how many students are there in total given there are some unknown number of boys playing soccer, displaying the answer like this (with 'b' as part of the answer) is acceptable. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
