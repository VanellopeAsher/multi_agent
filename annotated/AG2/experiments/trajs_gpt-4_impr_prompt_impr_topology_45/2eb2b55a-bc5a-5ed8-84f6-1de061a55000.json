We know the following information from the problem:\n\n- On Day 1, they used 38 bandages and bought one pack of 50 bandages.\n- On Day 2, they used 10 bandages less than the previous day (i.e., 38 - 10 = 28 bandages) and didnâ€™t buy any bandages.\n- On Day 3, they bought two large packs of bandages (2*50 = 100 bandages), used half a pack of bandages (50 / 2 = 25 bandages), and had 78 bandages remaining at the end of the day.\n\nWe can use these pieces of information to determine the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day.\n\nStep 1: Identify the total number of bandages used and bought in three days.\nThe number of bandages used on Day 1 = 38\nThe number of bandages used on Day 2 = 28\nThe number of bandages used on Day 3 = 25.\n\nThe total number of bandages used in three days = 38 (Day1) + 28 (Day2) + 25 (Day3) = 91 bandages.\n\nThe total number of bandages bought in three days = 50 (Day1) + 0 (Day2) + 100 (Day3) = 150 bandages.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the total number of bandages used from the total number of bandages bought and the leftover bandages on day 3 to find the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day.\n\nThe number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day = (Total number of bandages bought in three days + leftover bandages on Day 3) - total number of bandages used in three days\n\nPlugging the numbers = (150 + 78) - 91 = 137\n\nTherefore, the medical staff had 137 bandages at the start of the first day."

According to the solution given by Agent Problem Solver, the number of bandages in the beginning is calculated as total number of bandages bought - total number of bandages utilized + end balance of bandages.
