Without this information, we can't determine what percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras. However, here are the steps to solve the problem if we had the shark's length:\n\n1. First, find the total length of the remoras. Since Benny saw 2 6-inch remoras, the total length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.\n\n2. Then, convert the length of the shark to inches if it is not already in inches.\n\n3. Next, divide the total length of the remoras by the length of the shark. This will give the fraction of the shark's body length that is made up by the remoras.\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nAgain, we can't complete this calculation without knowing the length of the shark."
