Therefore, the first child is 74 - 2 = 72 inches tall.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the height of the first child in feet rather than in inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert the height of the first child to feet:\n\n1. 72 inches รท 12 = 6 feet.\n\nThus, the first child is 6 feet tall."
