Therefore, they used (\"b-10\") on the second day.\nStep 4: On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, adding 100 bandages (50 bandages per bulk pack * 2 = 100 bandages).\nStep 5: They used half a pack on the third day, which is 25 bandages (since a pack contains 50 bandages).\nStep 6: They have 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\nLet's put these into an equation:\nThe total bandages at the end of first day (69), minus bandages used on first day (b), plus bandages at the start of second day (0), minus bandages used on second day (b - 10), plus total bandages at the start of the third day (100), minus bandages used on the third day (25) should equal the total bandages left at the end of third day (78).\nThis gives us this equation:\n\n69 - b + 0 - (b - 10) + 100 - 25 = 78\n\nFrom this, we can calculate b, the number of bandages used on the first day."
