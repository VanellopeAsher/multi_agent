      "content": "Here's how we can calculate the number of pizza boxes that Marie ordered:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal: it's a fixed price item, so the total cost is just $12.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the milk: 5 packs at $3.5 each equals 5 * $3.5 = $17.5.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the apples: 4 apples at $1.5 each equals 4 * $1.5 = $6. \n4. Now, let's subtract the cost of these items from the total amount that Marie paid: $52.5 - $12 (for the chicken) - $17.5 (for the milk) - $6 (for the apples). This will give us the total amount that Marie spent on the pizza.\n5. Finally, divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box ($8.5) to find out how many boxes Marie ordered.\n\nPlease note that this solution will only work if the resulting number of boxes is a whole number (e.g. not a fraction), as you can't order a fraction of a pizza box. If it's not a whole number, then there might be an issue with the information provided and we'd need to double-check the prices or the total amount paid."
