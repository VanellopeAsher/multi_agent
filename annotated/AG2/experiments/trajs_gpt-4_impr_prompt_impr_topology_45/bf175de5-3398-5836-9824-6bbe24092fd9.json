      "content": "To solve this question, we will use the concept of man-days (a unit of measure often used in project management to estimate the amount of work a task will require).\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Determine how many days it would take for the single person to paint the entire house. Since the individual can paint half of the house in 5 days, it would take this person 10 days to paint the whole house.\n2. Find out how many man-days it would take to paint the house. If it takes 10 days for one person to paint the house, this equates to 10 man-days.\n3. Determine how long it would take for a team of 5 people to complete these 10 man-days' worth of tasks. This calculation is made by dividing the total man-days by the number of workers: 10 man-days / 5 workers = 2 days.\n4. Convert these days into hours. Since each workday has 24 hours, 2 days would be equivalent to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.\n\nThus, it would take a team of 5 individuals 48 hours to paint the entire house."
