Hence, Total oranges = No. of boxes * Oranges per box\n\nStep 2: Calculate how many oranges Mrs. Harrington gifted to her mother and her sibling.\n    - She gifted two boxes each to her mother and sibling. Therefore total gifts =  2 boxes to her mother + 2 boxes to her sibling. And donâ€™t forget that each box has 20 oranges.\n\nStep 3: Figure out the number of oranges left over after she made the gifts.\n    - To get this, subtract the total gifts (step 2) from the total oranges purchased (step 1).\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself.\n    - She saved a quarter of the remaining oranges after gifts. Therefore oranges for herself = 1/4 * oranges left (step 3).\n\nStep 5: Finally, establish how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold.\n    - To get this, subtract the oranges she kept (step 4) from the oranges left after gifts (step 3)."
