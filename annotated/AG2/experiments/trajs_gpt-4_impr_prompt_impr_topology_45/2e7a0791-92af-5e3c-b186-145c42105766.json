Since this was half his daily goal, we know it's 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps.\n\nStep 2: Add the additional steps from his short walk with his friend to this total. That's 5,000 steps + 1,000 steps = 6,000 steps.\n\nStep 3: Add the steps Elliott took when he went shopping. So that's 6,000 steps + 500 steps = 6,500 steps.\n\nStep 4: Determine how many steps Elliott had left to take after his jog. Given that he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we subtract this from his daily goal of 10,000 steps to find the total number of steps he will take before his last 2,000 steps. That's 10,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 8,000 steps.\n\nStep 5: Now to find the number of steps taken during his jog, we subtract the total steps taken before his jog (from steps 1 to 3) from the total steps taken before his last 2,000 steps (from step 4). That would be 8,000 steps - 6,500 steps = 1,500 steps. \n\nSo, Elliott took 1,500 steps during his jog."
