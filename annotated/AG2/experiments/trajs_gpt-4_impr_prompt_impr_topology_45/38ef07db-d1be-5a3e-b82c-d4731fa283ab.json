The length of paper that James needs to buy should be equivalent to the total perimeter of the rectangle.\n\nThe formula to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle is:\n```Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)```\n\nJames' fence is a rectangle with a length of 20.5 feet and a width of 15.5 feet. Substitute these values into the formula, we will get:\n```Perimeter = 2 * (20.5 + 15.5)```\n\nBy executing this calculation, we can find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy."
