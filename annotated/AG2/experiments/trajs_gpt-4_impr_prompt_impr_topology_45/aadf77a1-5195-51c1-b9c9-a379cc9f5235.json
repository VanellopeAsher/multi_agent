Afterward, this needs to be subtracted from the total area of the quilt to figure out the left over area that needs to be filled with small shirts.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Determine the total area of Medium shirts: With each medium shirt being 4 square feet and 8 shirts used, the total area covered by medium shirts = 4 * 8 = 32 square feet.\n2. Compute the total area of Large shirts: Each large shirt being 6 square feet and 6 shirts used, total area = 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.\n3. Add the total areas of Medium and Large shirts: 32 + 36 = 68 square feet.\n4. Subtract this total area from the total area of the quilt to find the area that will be covered by Small shirts: 101 - 68 = 33 square feet.\n5. Since each small shirt covers an area of 3 square feet, the number of small shirts used = 33 / 3 = 11 shirts. \n\nSo, Octavia used 11 small shirts to make the quilt."

Subtract this amount from the total area of the quilt to get the area that needs to be covered by the small shirts: 101 square feet - 68 square feet = 33 square feet\n5.
