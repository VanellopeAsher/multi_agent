To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

For one jar, the cost of passion fruit is: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12.\n   For one jar, the cost of jackfruit is: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12.\n   For one jar, the cost of honey is: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20.\n\n3. The total cost for one jar is: $12 (Passion fruit) + $12 (Jackfruit) + $20 (Honey) = $44.\n\n4. He sells each jar for $50, so the profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6.\n\n5.

These costs are then summed to establish the total cost per jar, which is subtracted from the selling price to determine the profit per jar. The total profit for 10 jars was then calculated by multiplying the profit per jar by 10.
