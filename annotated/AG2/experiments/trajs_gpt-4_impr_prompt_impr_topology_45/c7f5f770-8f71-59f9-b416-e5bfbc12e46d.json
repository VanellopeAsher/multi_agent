Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 6 = 12 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 12 = 12 fries left.\nStep 4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 6 - 3 = 3 fries, so Griffin had 12 - 3 = 9 fries left.\nStep 5. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, which resulted in Griffin having 33 fries.\n\nTo find out how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin, simply subtract the number of fries Griffin had before Ginger gave him fries (9 fries) from the number of fries Griffin had after Ginger gave him fries (33 fries).\n\nSo, Ginger gave Griffin 33 - 9 = 24 fries."

Colby took 3 less than Kyle's amount (6 - 3 = 3 fries), which left Griffin with 9 fries.\n5. Ginger added some fries to Griffin's, resulting in a total of 33 fries.\n\nUsing these calculations, obtain the amount Ginger added by subtracting the amount Griffin had just before Ginger added more fries from the final amount he had.\n\n```python\ninitial_fries = 30\nfries_after_Kyle = initial_fries - 6\nfries_after_Billy = fries_after_Kyle - 2*6\nfries_after_Colby = fries_after_Billy - (6 - 3)\nfinal_fries = 33\n\nfries_from_Ginger = final_fries - fries_after_Colby\nprint(fries_from_Ginger)\n```"
