Start by finding how long he runs for the non-first days. He runs half as much as the first day, which is 10 hours, so he runs 10/2 = 5 hours on the second and third day. \n\n2. Now that we have how long he runs each day, add all these hours together to find the total hours he runs in a week. So the total hours he runs is 10 (first day) + 5 (second day) + 5 (third day) = 20 hours. \n\n3. Now we can find his speed by taking the total miles he runs and dividing it by the total hours. His speed is therefore 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles per hour. \n\nSo, John runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour."
