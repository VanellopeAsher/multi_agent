This 1/4 or 20 students represent 1/3 of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer at home.\n\nSolution:\n1. Since 20 students represent 1/3 of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop, then there are 20 * 3 = 60 students who do not own either a desktop or a laptop.\n2. If 60 students represent students who don't have a computer and this is equivalent to 1/4 of total students. Then there are a total of 60 * 4 = 240 students in that grade level.\n\nSo, based on the given problem and our calculations, there are 240 students in total at that grade level."
