      "content": "Here's how we arrive at the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the total cost of the jacket and shoes:**  Sara wants to buy a jacket which costs $120 and two pairs of shoes which cost $100 each. So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $120 + 2*$100 = $320\n\n2. **Calculate Sara's total earnings from babysitting:**  If she babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times and gets $5 each time, then her total earnings from babysitting is 10 * $5 = $50\n\n3. **Identify Sara's initial savings:**  Sara had $100 saved already.\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount that Sara has after babysitting and initial savings:** Combining her earnings from babysitting and her initial savings, she now has $100 + $50 = $150\n\n5. **Check if she can afford the jacket and shoes and Identify the remaining amount needed to buy the jacket and shoes:** Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes ($320) is greater than what she currently has ($150), she still needs $320 - $150 = $170\n\n6. **Calculate the number of times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money:**  Since her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn, to get $170, Sara must mow the lawn $170/$10 = 17 times. \n\nSo, Sara needs to mow the lawn 17 times to buy the jacket and the shoes she wants."

We calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes, the total amount Sara earns from babysitting, and add this to her initial amount. Next, we subtract the cost of the jacket and shoes from the total amount Sara has after babysitting to find out how much more she needs. Finally, we divide the remaining amount by how much she earns mowing the lawn to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn."
