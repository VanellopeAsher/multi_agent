The calculation is as follows:\n\nTotal candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy\n\nThen, divide the total amount of candy by three (since there are three individuals) to determine how much candy each person would have. This can be done using the formula:\n\nEqual share of candy = Total candy / 3\n\nSince we have numerical values for each person's candy, we can substitute those values into the formulas:\n\nTotal candy = 3 lbs (Robert's candy) + 5 lbs (Cindy's candy) + 4 lbs (Aaron's candy) = 12 lbs\nEqual share of candy = 12 lbs / 3 = 4 lbs\n\nThis indicates that each person would have 4 pounds of candy if they decided to equally distribute the candy they collected during Halloween."
