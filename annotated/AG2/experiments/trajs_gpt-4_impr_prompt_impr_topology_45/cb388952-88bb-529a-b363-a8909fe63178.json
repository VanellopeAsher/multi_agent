I'll start by adding 15 to both sides of the equation.\n\n45 + 15 = 10*(son's age) \n\n60 = 10*(son's age)\n\nStep 5: Divide both sides of the equation by 10 to isolate  the \"son's age\". This should give me the exact age of his son.\n\n60 / 10 = son's age\n\nStep 6: Conclude - After solving for \"son's age\", we can say that Carver's son is 6 years old. \n\nNow it's time for Agent Code Executor to write a Python function to check this manually calculated result."
