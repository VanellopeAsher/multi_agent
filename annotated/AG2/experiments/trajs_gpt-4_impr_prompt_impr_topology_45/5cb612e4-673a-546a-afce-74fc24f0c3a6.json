The net profit per bag is the selling price per bag ($30) minus the cost price per bag ($20) and minus the transportation cost per bag ($2). \n\nThen, I will calculate the total number of bags sold by dividing the total profit ($400) by the net profit per bag. This will give the number of bags sold by the trader. \n\nPlease note that to make calculations simpler, we will focus on the profit per bag for the moment. I will break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Define the selling price per bag (sp) as $30.\n2. Define the cost price per bag (cp) as $20.\n3. Define the transportation cost per bag (tc) as $2.\n4. Calculate the net profit per bag (nppb) by subtracting the cost price and the transportation cost from the selling price: nppb = sp - cp - tc.\n5. Define the total profit made by the trader (tp) as $400.\n6. Calculate the total number of bags sold (nbs) by dividing the total profit by the net profit per bag: nbs = tp / nppb.\n\nThe final answer will be the result from step 6. This is the total number of bags sold by the trader. \n\nLet's discuss further in case there are things that need to be clarified."
