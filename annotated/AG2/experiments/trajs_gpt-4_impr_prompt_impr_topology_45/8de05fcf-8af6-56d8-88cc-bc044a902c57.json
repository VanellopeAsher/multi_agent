      "content": "To solve this problem, I will go through the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. We know that she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than she did on Monday, and that she wrote 5 articles on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 additional articles on Tuesday, for a total of 7 articles on Tuesday.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total time Meredith spent writing on Monday and Tuesday. Since we know that each article takes her 4 hours to write, we can calculate the time she spent writing articles on these two days as (5 articles on Monday + 7 articles on Tuesday) * 4 hours/article = 48 hours.\n\nStep 3: Determine the time Meredith spent writing on Wednesday. We know that she spent a total of 104 hours writing over the three days, so she must have spent 104 total hours - 48 hours spent on Monday and Tuesday = 56 hours writing on Wednesday.\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday. Since each article takes 4 hours to write, Meredith must have written 56 hours / 4 hours/article = 14 articles on Wednesday.\n\nStep 5: Determine how many times as many articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday. This can be calculated as 14 articles on Wednesday / 7 articles on Tuesday = 2 times as many articles. \n\nThus Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday."
