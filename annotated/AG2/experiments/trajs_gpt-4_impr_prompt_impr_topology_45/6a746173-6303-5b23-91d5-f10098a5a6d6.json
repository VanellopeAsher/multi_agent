Calculate the sum of the contributions from his neighbors, the online fund, and his friend: $300 (neighbors) + $1200 (online fund) + $120 (friend).\n2. Multiply the result by 3 (because his lawyer contributes three times as much as this total amount).\n\nNow, let's compute the final amount the lawyer will contribute. \nAgent Code Executor, could you assist in completing these steps, please?"
