Adding boating time and swimming time together, we get 6.6 + 3.3 = 9.9 hours.\n\n3. He also watched 3 shows that were 2.5 hours each. The total time he spent watching shows is 3 * 2.5 = 7.5 hours. \n\n4. The total time he spent so far (boating, swimming, and watching shows) is 9.9 + 7.5 = 17.4 hours. \n\n5. Given that this total time of 17.4 hours represents only 30% of his total time, we can calculate the 100% total time by dividing the time he spent so far by 0.30 (30/100).\n\n6. Once we have the total time John spent on vacation, we can calculate the time he spent sightseeing by taking 40% of the total time. \n\n7. The final answer will be the time John spent sightseeing (from step 6). \n\nNext, I would recommend agent Code_Executor to assist in calculating the actual numbers."
