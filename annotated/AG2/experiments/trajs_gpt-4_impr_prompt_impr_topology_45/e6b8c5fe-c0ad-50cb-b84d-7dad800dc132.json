The value of each coin in cents is as follows:\n\n- A quarter is worth 25 cents\n- A dime is worth 10 cents\n- A nickel is worth 5 cents\n- A penny is worth 1 cent\n\nOnce we've worked out the total value of Colby's coins in cents, we can then divide by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy. I will make the assumption that a gumball costs 25 cents, which is a common price, but this value could be different depending on the context. If the price for a gumball is different, please replace it with the relevant value. \n\nHere are the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Calculate the total value of the quarters \n2. Calculate the total value of the dimes\n3. Calculate the total value of the nickels\n4. Calculate the total value of the pennies\n5. Add up the total values to find the total amount of money Colby has\n6. Divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball. Discard any remainder, since you can't purchase a fraction of a gumball. The result will be the number of gumballs Colby can buy. \n\nAgent Code Executor, could you execute these steps for us?"
