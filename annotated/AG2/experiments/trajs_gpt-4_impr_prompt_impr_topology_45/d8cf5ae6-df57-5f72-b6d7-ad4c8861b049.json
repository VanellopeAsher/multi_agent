Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Calculate the total weight of the sugar cubes: \n\n    ``Since each box weighs 1 pound and he buys 2 boxes, the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.``\n\n2. Calculate the total weight of the carrots:\n\n    ``Each bag weighs 12 pounds and he buys 4 bags, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.``\n    \n3. Calculate the total weight of the hay:\n\n    ``Each bale weighs 75 pounds and he buys 42 bales, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.``\n    \n4. Calculate the total weight of the oats:\n\n    ``Each sack weighs 65 pounds and he buys 20 sacks, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.``\n    \n5. Add the total weights of the sugar cubes, carrots, hay, and oats to get the total weight of all the feed:\n\n    ``Total feed weight = weight of sugar cubes + weight of carrots + weight of hay + weight of oats = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.``\n    \n6. Since the farmer can transport all the feed in 2 trips, the weight his truck can carry at a time is Total Feed Weight / number of trips. \n\n    ``Weight the farmer's truck can carry = Total feed weight / 2 = 4500 / 2 = 2250 pounds``\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time."
