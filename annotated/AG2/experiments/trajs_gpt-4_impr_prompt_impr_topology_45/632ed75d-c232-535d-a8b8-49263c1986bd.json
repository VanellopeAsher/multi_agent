For the remaining flights made by the first aircraft, 3/4 are to Greece and the rest are divided equally between France and Germany.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total flights of the first aircraft\nBy taking into account that 44 flights of the second aircraft are half of the flights made by the first aircraft, we can conclude that the total flights made by the first aircraft are 44 * 2 = 88 flights.\n\nStep 3: Find the flights to Greece\nGiven that 3/4 of the flights are to Greece, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece by multiplying 3/4 by 88. \n\nStep 4: Determine flights to France and Germany\nSince the flights to Greece take up 3/4 of all flights and the remaining flights are shared equally between France and Germany, the flights to each of these countries are 1/4 of the total flights divided by 2. \n\nStep 5: Implement the calculations\nImplementing the above operations we would derive the number of flights made daily by the first aircraft to France.

      "content": "Okay. Let's translate the logic provided by Agent_Problem_Solver into python code.\n\n1. **Understand the question**: The problem has given that the second aircraft flights are half of the first aircraft flights. In this case, the second aircraft makes 44 flights in a day. Therefore, the total flights of the first aircraft are twice that of the second aircraft. \n  \n2. **Total flights of the first aircraft**: We will double the total flights of the second aircraft, which are 44, to get the total flights of the first aircraft.\n\n3. **Flights to Greece**: It is given that 3/4th of the first flights go to Greece. We calculate this value.\n\n4. **Flights to France and Germany**: It's mentioned in the problem statement that the remaining flights after deducting the Greece flights from the total are evenly split between France and Germany. We get this value by subtracting the Greece flights from the total flights and then dividing the result by two.\n\nFinally, I'll print the flights to France.\n\n```python\n# total flights of the second aircraft\nsecond_aircraft_flights = 44\n\n# total flights of the first aircraft\nfirst_aircraft_flights = second_aircraft_flights * 2\n\n# flights to Greece\ngreece_flights = (3 / 4) * first_aircraft_flights\n\n# remaining flights are to France and Germany, Do note, they are shared equally\nremaining_flights = first_aircraft_flights - greece_flights\nfrance_flights = remaining_flights / 2\ngermany_flights = remaining_flights / 2  # not needed for this particular problem, but calculated for completeness\n\nprint(france_flights)\n```\nI'll now execute this code to find the solution."
