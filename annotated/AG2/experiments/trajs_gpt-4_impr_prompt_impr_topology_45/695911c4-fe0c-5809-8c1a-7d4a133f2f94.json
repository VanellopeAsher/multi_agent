      "content": "Here's how you would solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate how much she spent on her visits in the first 10 years. \n   Since she visits the museum three times a year and each visit costs $10, this amounts to 3 visits/year * 10 years * $10/visit = $300. \n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of one visit after a 150% increase. \n   A 150% increase from $10 adds a 1.50 times the original price to it. Thus, the new price would be $10 original price + $10 * 1.50 = $25 per visit.\n\n3. Then, we need to calculate how much she spent on her visits in the next 3 years with the increased visit cost. \n   Since she still visits the museum three times a year and each visit now costs $25, this amounts to 3 visits/year * 3 years * $25/visit = $225. \n\n4. Finally, we add the total amount she spent in the first 10 years with what she spent in the next 3 years to get the total amount she spent over the 13 years. Therefore, $300 for the first 10 years + $225 for the next 3 years = $525. \n\nSo, Pauline spent a total of $525 on all visits to the museum."
