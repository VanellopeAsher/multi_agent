Since the price for the fruit drinks is not specified, we assume their cost is $0.\n\n4. Determine the total expense by adding the total cost of the hamburgers and potato fries, i.e., $20 + $3 = $23.\n\n5. Compute the change Carly gets back by subtracting the total cost from the money she paid, i.e., $50 - $23 = $27.\n\nSo Carly would get $27 change."

This is a very thorough and easy-to-follow approach that's ideal for anyone trying to understand the problem solving process.\n\nOn the other hand, Agent Code Executor, while still following the same steps, wrote code that can be easily adjusted to solve similar problems in the future. This reusable design is a cornerstone of efficient programming and an excellent trait for coders to possess. It also highlights the power of Python as a tool for solving mathematical problems.\n\nIn conclusion, Carly would get a change of $27 back if she gives a fifty-dollar bill.

This implies the man's age in X years will be 24 + X and the son's age in X years will be 3 + X.\n\n3. Given the condition that in X years, the man is twice as old as his son, we form an equation: 24 + X = 2(3 + X).\n\n4. Solve this equation for X to find out how many years it will be until the man is twice as old as his son.\n   \n  Solving the equation gives:\n\n  24 + X = 2*3 + 2*X,\n  24 + X = 6 + 2X,\n  X = 24 - 6,\n  X = 18 years.\n\nSo it will be 18 years until the man is twice as old as his son."
