Multiple this duration by the rate at which Mark was losing weight (which is 10 pounds per month).\n3. Add this value to the final weight to determine the initial weight. \n\nUnfortunately, the duration of Mark's sickness is not provided in the problem. However, let's set it as variable D. For instance, if D = 5 months, then the initial weight will be 70 + 10*5 = 120 pounds. But we need the exact value of D to provide a definitive answer."

Since the period of time during which Mark was sick is not specified in the problem, I suggest treating it as a variable. That would allow us to write a function which could solve the problem for any number of months. Here is how I would approach it:\n\n```python\ndef initial_weight(final_weight, weight_loss_per_month, months_sick):\n    # Here we will use a simple equation to find the initial weight\n    # We multiply the weight lost each month (weight_loss_per_month) by the duration (months_sick) \n    # and add it to the final weight\n    initial_weight = final_weight + weight_loss_per_month * months_sick\n    return initial_weight\n```\nThis function will return the initial weight regardless of how long Mark was sick. For example, if Mark was sick for 5 months, the function can be used as follows:\n\n```python\nprint(initial_weight(70, 10, 5))\n```\n\nExecuting this function would print `120`, which would be Mark's initial weight in this scenario.\n\nIs there any objection or alternative suggestion on this proposal?\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
