Since Patty charges $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour, and the job required 2.25 hours, we round this up to 3 hours. Multiply this by the $35 hourly rate.\n\nStep 2: Add the service fee of $40 and the cost of parts which is $60.\n\nStep 3: Add together the labor charge, the service fee, and the cost of parts to obtain the total amount billed."

Import the ceiling function from the math library which will allow us to always round up the number of hours. This is because Patty charges for each hour or fraction of an hour. \n2. Compute the labor charge by multiplying the number of hours (rounded up) with the hourly rate.\n3. Compute the total cost by adding the service fee, labor charge, and parts cost.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Defining the given variables\nservice_fee = 40 \nhourly_rate = 35 \nhours_worked = 2.25 \nparts_cost = 60 \n\n# Calculate the labor charge\nlabor_charge = math.ceil(hours_worked) * hourly_rate \n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_amount_billed = service_fee + labor_charge + parts_cost\n\nprint(total_amount_billed)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
