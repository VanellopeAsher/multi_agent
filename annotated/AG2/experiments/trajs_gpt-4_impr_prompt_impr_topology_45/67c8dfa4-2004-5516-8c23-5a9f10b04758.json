This can be done by dividing the total profit ($160) by the profit per bag (calculated in step 1).\n\n3. Figure out how many packs of bags were bought. Since each pack contains 5 bags, divide the total number of bags sold (from step 2) by 5 to find out how many packs Tara bought. \n\nNow let's proceed with these steps."
