You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

We will use Python to calculate these values.\n\nHereâ€™s the step-by-step process to determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.\n2. Calculate how much money Ali gives to his sister.\n3. Calculate how much money Ali uses to buy dinner.\n4. Determine the amount remaining after buying dinner.\n\nLet's calculate using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import required libraries\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Calculate total amount of money initially\nten_bills = 4 * 10\ntwenty_bills = 6 * 20\ntotal_money = ten_bills + twenty_bills\n\n# Calculate the amount given to Ali's sister\nsister_share = Fraction(1, 2) * total_money\n\n# Calculate the remaining money after giving to his sister\nremaining_after_sister = total_money - sister_share\n\n# Calculate the money spent on dinner (3/5 of remaining amount)\ndinner_expense = Fraction(3, 5) * remaining_after_sister\n\n# Calculate remaining money after buying dinner\nremaining_money = remaining_after_sister - dinner_expense\n\n# Display the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\nThe above code will provide the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner in a fraction form. Let's run this to find the answer."
