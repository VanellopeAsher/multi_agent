You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

We'll proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the total time spent running each week:**\n\n    - John runs for 3 hours on the first day.\n    - On the other two days, he runs for half of that, which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) hours each day.\n\n2. **Calculate total running time for the week:**\n\n    Total time = \\( 3 + 2 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\n3. **Calculate John's speed:**\n\n    - John's total distance per week is 60 miles.\n    - Using the formula for speed: \\(\\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}}\\).\n\nLet's calculate using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total running time in hours\nday1_time = 3\nday2_and_3_time = Rational(3, 2)\ntotal_time = day1_time + 2 * day2_and_3_time\n\n# Total distance in miles\ntotal_distance = 60\n\n# Calculate speed in miles per hour\nspeed = Rational(total_distance, total_time)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"John's running speed is: {speed} miles per hour\")\n```\n\nRun this code to find John's running speed."
