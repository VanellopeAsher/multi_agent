You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia.

Calculate how much money Kassidy has using the relation with Aurelia's money.\n2. Calculate how much money Rayna has using the relation with Kassidy's money.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money between Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia.\n4. Divide the total by 3 to find the equal share.\n\nLet's write the program:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Known values\naurelia_money = 150\n\n# Calculate Kassidy's money\nkassidy_money = Rational(2, 3) * aurelia_money\n\n# Calculate Rayna's money\nrayna_money = kassidy_money + 70\n\n# Total money\ntotal_money = aurelia_money + kassidy_money + rayna_money\n\n# Equal share\nequal_share = total_money / 3\n\nprint(equal_share)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the equal amount each would have if their money is shared equally."
