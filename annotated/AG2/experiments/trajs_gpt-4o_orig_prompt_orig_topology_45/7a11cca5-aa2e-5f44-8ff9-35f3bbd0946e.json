You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We will set up a simple calculation to find the increase amount on the third day.\n\n1. We know the initial amount of water passing is 4000 gallons.\n2. After a heavy rain, this amount doubles, meaning the second day's amount is \\(4000 \\times 2 = 8000\\) gallons.\n3. On the third day, the total amount of water is given as 14000 gallons.\n4. We need to find the increase in the amount of water on the third day compared to the second day.\n\nThis can be done by subtracting the amount on the second day from the amount on the third day.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Initial amount of water\ninitial_amount = 4000\n\n# Amount of water on the second day\nsecond_day_amount = 2 * initial_amount\n\n# Total amount of water on the third day\nthird_day_amount = 14000\n\n# Calculate the increase amount on the third day\nincrease_amount = third_day_amount - second_day_amount\n\n# Print the increase amount\nprint(increase_amount)\n```\n\nNow let's continue with the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Output the boxed result\nfrom sympy import symbols\nfrom sympy import init_printing\n\ninit_printing(use_unicode=True)\n\ninitial_amount = 4000\nsecond_day_amount = 2 * initial_amount\nthird_day_amount = 14000\n\nincrease_amount = third_day_amount - second_day_amount\n\nprint(f\"\\\\boxed{{{increase_amount}}}\")\n```\n\nThis should give us the increase in the amount of water on the third day.\n\n"
