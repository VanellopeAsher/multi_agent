You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

Calculate the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.\n2. Use the leftover wheels information to find the initial number of wheels in the box.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the code:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbol and mathematical operations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the number of toys\ncars = 57\nmotorcycles = 73\n\n# Calculate the total number of wheels used\n# 4 wheels per car and 2 wheels per motorcycle\nwheels_used = 4 * cars + 2 * motorcycles\n\n# Let x be the initial number of wheels in the box\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation setup, where x - wheels_used is the leftover wheels\nequation = Eq(x - wheels_used, 276)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\ninitial_wheels_in_box = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the number of wheels initially in the box\nprint(initial_wheels_in_box)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the initial number of wheels that Henry had in the box."
