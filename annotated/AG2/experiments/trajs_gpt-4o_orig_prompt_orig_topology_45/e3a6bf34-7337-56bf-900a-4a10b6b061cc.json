If a yellow tie costs $30, then a green tie costs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of green tie} = 30 + 0.7 \\times 30 = 51\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine costs for red and blue ties based on their quantities:**\n   - We don't have specific costs for red or blue ties, nor quantities mentioned other than red ties being twice the blue ties.\n\nWe will utilize this reasoning to determine these calculations and will encode calculations for further clarity.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Number of yellow ties\ncost_per_yellow_tie = 30\ntotal_spent_on_yellow_ties = 300\nnumber_of_yellow_ties = total_spent_on_yellow_ties // cost_per_yellow_tie\n\n# Step 2: Cost of a green tie\ncost_per_green_tie = cost_per_yellow_tie * 1.7\n\n# Using variables for the unknowns (x = number of blue ties)\nx = Symbol('x')  # number of blue ties\nr = 2 * x        # number of red ties\n\n# Assume Blue tie costs b, and Red tie costs r\nb_cost = Symbol('b')\nr_cost = Symbol('r')\n\n# Eq3 and Eq4 establish spendings if unknowns needed.\n# \n# You must determine these spendings through known constraints.\n# More information will be needed about either prices or total spending.\n\n# Costs are placeholders to determine an answer.\n# As price or quantities are unknown for blue/red, we assert this theoretically:\neq3 = Eq(b_cost + r_cost + cost_per_green_tie, 'total cost to be determined')\n\nprint(number_of_yellow_ties)\nprint(cost_per_green_tie)\n```\n\nSince we're missing details on the total spending or prices for red and blue ties, there must be resolved information which involves assumptions or further inputs relevant to the ties other than green/yellow. If they're irrelevant, focus primarily on the verified calculations from yellow and green."
