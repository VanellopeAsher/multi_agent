You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween.

This is a straightforward problem that can be directly solved using Python code.\n\nHere's how we'll approach it:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of candy.\n2. Divide the total candy amount by the number of people to find out how much each person gets.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial amounts of candy\nrobert_candy = 3\ncindy_candy = 5\naaron_candy = 4\n\n# Total amount of candy\ntotal_candy = robert_candy + cindy_candy + aaron_candy\n\n# Number of people\nnumber_of_people = 3\n\n# Amount of candy each person gets\ncandy_per_person = Rational(total_candy, number_of_people)\n\n# Print the result in fractions\nprint(f\"Each person will have {candy_per_person} pounds of candy.\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total candy, divides it equally among the three people, and prints the result in fractional form to comply with the requirement. \n\nRunning the code will give you the answer in \\(\\boxed{\\text{fraction form}}\\)."
