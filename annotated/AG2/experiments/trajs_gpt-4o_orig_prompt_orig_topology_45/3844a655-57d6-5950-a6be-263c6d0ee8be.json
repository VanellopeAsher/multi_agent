  "problem": "Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $2000, regardless of how many guests attend. While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation that captures the total cost of each venue as a function of the number of guests.\n\nHere's how you can break down the problem:\n\n1. **Total cost for the first venue:**\n   - Flat fee: $2000\n   - Additional cost per guest for food: $50\n   - If \\( n \\) is the number of guests, the total cost for the first venue is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost}_1 = 2000 + 50n\n     \\]\n\n2. **Total cost for the second venue:**\n   - Costs per guest: $250 (already includes food)\n   - Similarly, for \\( n \\) guests, the total cost for the second venue is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost}_2 = 250n\n     \\]\n\n3. **Equating the costs:**\n   - For the costs for the two venues to be equal:\n     \\[\n     2000 + 50n = 250n\n     \\]\n\nWe solve this equation for \\( n \\) using Python to find how many guests are necessary for both options to cost the same.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(2000 + 50 * n, 250 * n)\n\n# Solve the equation\nnumber_of_guests = solve(equation, n)\n\n# Print the result \nprint(number_of_guests)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give the value of \\( n \\), which represents the number of guests necessary for the costs to be equal at both venues. The result will appear as a fraction if necessary, in accordance with the query requirements."
