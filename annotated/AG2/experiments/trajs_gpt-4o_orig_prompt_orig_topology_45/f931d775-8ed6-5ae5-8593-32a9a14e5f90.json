      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of lines that Sean has to memorize for the song and both scenes. We will consider Sean's solo song, the two scenes, and his specific lines.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Solo Song**: Sean has to memorize 54 lines directly from his solo song.\n\n2. **First Scene**:\n   - Total lines: The scene has twice the number of lines as the song. Therefore, 2 × 54 = 108 lines.\n   - Sean's lines: One-third of these 108 lines are his. Therefore, (1/3) × 108 = 36 lines.\n\n3. **Second Scene**:\n   - Total lines: The scene has six more lines than the song. Therefore, 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\n   - Sean's lines: Four-fifths of these 60 lines are his. Therefore, (4/5) × 60 = 48 lines.\n   - However, Sean needs to memorize only 15 lines because one actor can't come. So, he memorizes 15 lines instead of 48.\n\n4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize**: Combine all of the lines he needs to memorize:\n   - Song lines: 54\n   - His lines in the first scene: 36\n   - Adjusted lines in the second scene: 15\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of lines in the solo song\nsong_lines = 54\n\n# Number of lines in the first scene\nfirst_scene_total_lines = 2 * song_lines\nsean_first_scene_lines = first_scene_total_lines / 3\n\n# Number of lines in the second scene\nsecond_scene_total_lines = song_lines + 6\nsean_second_scene_lines = Rational(4, 5) * second_scene_total_lines\n\n# Adjusted lines Sean has to memorize due to another actor\nadjusted_second_scene_lines = 15\n\n# Total lines Sean has to memorize\ntotal_lines = song_lines + sean_first_scene_lines + adjusted_second_scene_lines\n\nprint(total_lines)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will provide the total number of lines Sean has to memorize:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]"

Let's ensure our result is presented in whole numbers since the number of lines must be an integer.\n\nWhen adding up the number of lines, it should directly come out as a whole number.
