  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

We can break down the solution into a series of steps and perform calculations with Python.\n\n**Key idea:** \nWe will use the definition of profit to find the total expenses, and from there, calculate the cost of each pack of cloths.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Calculate the total number of current and potential clients.\n2. Calculate the total number of bleach bottles used each week.\n3. Calculate the total expenses on bleach.\n4. Calculate the total weekly expenses using the profit formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Income} - \\text{Expenses}\n   \\]\n5. Extract the cost of cloth packs by subtracting bleach expenses from total expenses and dividing by the number of packs.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Number of current and potential clients\nclients = 3 + 5\n\n# Bottles of bleach needed per client\nbottles_per_client = 2\ncost_per_bottle = 2\n\n# Total bottles and cost\ntotal_bottles = clients * bottles_per_client\ntotal_bleach_cost = total_bottles * cost_per_bottle\n\n# Income and profit\nincome = 92\nprofit = 20\n\n# Calculate total expenses\nexpenses = income - profit\n\n# Number of packs of cloths needed\npacks_per_client = 1\ntotal_packs = clients * packs_per_client\n\n# Using the equation to solve for the cost of each pack of cloths\ncloth_cost = symbols('cloth_cost')\nequation = Eq(expenses, total_bleach_cost + total_packs * cloth_cost)\n\n# Solve the equation\ncloth_cost_value = solve(equation, cloth_cost)\nprint(cloth_cost_value[0])\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the cost of each pack of cloths. Running this will give us the value."
