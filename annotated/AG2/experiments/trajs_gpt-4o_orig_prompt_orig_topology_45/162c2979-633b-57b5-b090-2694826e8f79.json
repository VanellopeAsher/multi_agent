  "problem": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.

This problem can be solved directly by calculation.\n\nHereâ€™s the breakdown of the costs:\n- Strawberry gum: Suzie bought two packs, each costing $2, so the total is \\(2 \\times 2\\).\n- Grape gum: She bought one pack for $2.\n- Green apple gum: She paid half as much as the grape gum, which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\).\n\nNow we can calculate the total cost directly using Python:\n\n```python\n# Using sympy for rational calculations\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate costs for each type of gum\nstrawberry_cost = 2 * 2  # two packs of strawberry gum\ngrape_cost = 2  # one pack of grape gum\ngreen_apple_cost = Rational(1, 2) * 2  # half of the grape gum price\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = strawberry_cost + grape_cost + green_apple_cost\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nAfter running the code, we get the total amount that Suzie paid.
