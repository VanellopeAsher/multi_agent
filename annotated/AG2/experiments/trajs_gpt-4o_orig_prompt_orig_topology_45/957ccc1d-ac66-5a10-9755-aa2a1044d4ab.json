You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th.

Calculate the total weight loss required by Andy, which is given as 30 lbs.\n2. Calculate the total calorie deficit needed to achieve this weight loss using the fact that 3500 calories need to be burned to lose 1 pound.\n3. Calculate the total number of days from December 31 to July 19.\n4. Compute the daily calorie deficit by dividing the total calorie deficit by the number of days.\n\nNow, let's write a Python program to solve it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\n\n# Define constants\nlbs_to_lose = 30\ncalories_per_pound = 3500\n\n# Calculate total calories needed to lose\ntotal_calories = lbs_to_lose * calories_per_pound\n\n# Calculate the number of days between Dec 31st and July 19th\nstart_date = date(2023, 12, 31)\nend_date = date(2024, 7, 19)\ndays_difference = (end_date - start_date).days\n\n# Calculate daily calorie deficit\ndaily_calorie_deficit = total_calories / days_difference\n\n# Output the daily calorie deficit\nprint(f\"Daily Calorie Deficit: {daily_calorie_deficit:.2f} calories\")\n```\n\nLet's calculate:"
