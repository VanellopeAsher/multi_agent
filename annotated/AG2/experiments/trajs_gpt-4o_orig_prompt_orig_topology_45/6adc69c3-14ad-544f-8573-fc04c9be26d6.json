You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's define what we need to find:\n\nMarty has a ribbon that he must cut into equal parts in a sequence of steps. The final parts are each 5 cm long. We will work backwards from this information to determine the total length of the ribbon.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Let's denote the total length of the ribbon as \\( L \\) cm.\n2. The ribbon is first cut into 4 equal parts.\n3. Each of these 4 parts is then cut into 5 equal smaller parts.\n4. Each of the final parts is 5 cm in length.\n\nWe need to determine what \\( L \\) is.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. The final parts are 5 cm each and result from dividing the ribbon twice:\n   - 4 initial parts, each divided further into 5 parts: total \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) parts.\n   - Total length of all parts: \\( 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\) cm.\n\nTherefore, the length of the ribbon is \\( L = 100 \\) cm.\n\nThis problem can be solved with basic reasoning without the need for Python code, as it involves straightforward multiplication and is a simple logical deduction problem.\n\nThus, the total length of the ribbon is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) cm."
