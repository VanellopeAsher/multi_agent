      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs were found by the friends. Here's how to approach it:\n\nWe know:\n- The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\) eggs.\n- All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.\n\nLet's denote the total number of eggs as \\(E\\). Thus, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Total eggs found by Smith twins} + \\text{Total eggs found by friends} + 10 = E \\]\n\nGiven that the total eggs found by Smith twins is 60, and friends found the rest except 10, we can represent it as:\n\\[ 60 + \\text{Eggs found by friends} + 10 = E \\]\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{Eggs found by friends} = E - 60 - 10 \\]\n  \nSince all the eggs were found except 10, we can equate the total number of eggs to:\n\\[ E = \\text{Eggs found by Smith twins} + \\text{Eggs found by friends} + 10 \\]\n\nWe can substitute the expression for the eggs found by friends:\n\\[ E = 60 + (E - 60 - 10) + 10 \\]\n\nSolving for the eggs found by friends:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nE = symbols('E')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(E, 60 + (E - 60 - 10) + 10)\n\n# Solve the equation for E and calculate eggs found by friends\nsolution_E = solve(equation, E)[0]\neggs_found_by_friends = solution_E - 60 - 10\n\n# Print the result in the specified format\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends)\n```\n\nRun this Python code, and it will give you the number of eggs found by the friends."

There isn't a need to solve for \\(E\\) explicitly.\n\nSo, the eggs found by friends are:\n\\[ \\text{Eggs found by friends} = 60 - 0\\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs found by friends is simply \\(60\\).\n\nLet's correct the code:\n```python\n# Calculate eggs found by friends\neggs_found_by_friends = 60\n\n# Print the result\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the correct number of eggs found by the friends. \\(\\boxed{60}\\) eggs."
