Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Let's calculate.\n\n```python\n# calculated cost\ntotal_cost = 10.00 + 2 * 2.50 + 3 * 2.00 + 2.00\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThe output will be the total amount Scarlett spent.
