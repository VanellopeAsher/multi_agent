You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Calculate the rate at which one individual paints the house in terms of the whole house per day.\n2. Scale this rate by the number of individuals to find the combined rate of the team.\n3. Calculate the total time required for the team to paint the entire house using their combined rate.\n\nLet's carry out the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols, solve\n\n# Define a symbol for the number of days (d) it takes for the team to paint the house.\nd = symbols('d')\n\n# Define the rate at which one individual paints:\n# Half a house in 5 days means the rate is 1/10 of a house per day.\nindividual_rate = Rational(1, 10)\n\n# For 5 individuals, the combined rate is:\ncombined_rate = 5 * individual_rate\n\n# We set up the equation: combined_rate * d = 1 (they paint 1 whole house)\nequation = combined_rate * d - 1\n\n# Solve this equation for d (in days)\ndays_to_paint = solve(equation, d)[0]\n\n# Convert days to hours (1 day = 24 hours)\nhours_to_paint = days_to_paint * 24\n\n# Output in fraction form\nprint(hours_to_paint)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we get the result as a fraction, representing the number of hours it takes for the team of 5 individuals to paint the entire house. Let's box the final answer:\n\n\\(\\boxed{24}\\)"
