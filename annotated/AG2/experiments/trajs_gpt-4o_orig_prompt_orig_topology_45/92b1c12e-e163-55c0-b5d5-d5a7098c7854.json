You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.

Carver is 45 years old and 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter:\n   \\[\n   45 = 2d - 5\n   \\]\n   \n2. Carver's daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son:\n   \\[\n   d = 3s + 4\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Equations\n1. First, solve the equation \\( 45 = 2d - 5 \\) for \\( d \\).\n2. Substitute the value of \\( d \\) from the first result into the equation \\( d = 3s + 4 \\) to find \\( s \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nd, s = symbols('d s')\n\n# Equation 1: 45 = 2d - 5\neq1 = Eq(2*d - 5, 45)\n\n# Equation 2: d = 3s + 4\neq2 = Eq(d, 3*s + 4)\n\n# Solve the first equation for d\nd_value = solve(eq1, d)[0]\n\n# Substitute d_value into the second equation to solve for s\neq2_substituted = eq2.subs(d, d_value)\ns_value = solve(eq2_substituted, s)[0]\n\n# Print the solution for s\nprint(s_value)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the equations and output the age of Carver's son. \nOnce you execute it, you'll find the son's age encapsulated in the box:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{s}\n\\]"
