Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of Scarlett's purchases. Let's categorize and break down each purchase:\n\n- Fish tank: $10.00\n- Two packets of stones: $2.50 each, so $2.50 * 2\n- Three coral pieces: $2.00 each, so $2.00 * 3\n- 20 fish: $0.50 each, so $0.50 * 20\n- One packet of fish food: $2.00\n\nThe key idea is to calculate the cost for each category and then sum them up to get the total expense. We'll use Python to perform these calculations and present the result in dollars using the 'print' function. \n\nLet's write the code for it:\n\n```python\n# Using Python to calculate the total cost based on given details\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# calculate each component's total cost\nfish_tank_cost = 10\nstone_cost = Rational('2.50') * 2\ncoral_cost = 2 * 3\nfish_cost = Rational('0.50') * 20\nfish_food_cost = 2\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = fish_tank_cost + stone_cost + coral_cost + fish_cost + fish_food_cost\n\n# print total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThe script will compute the total by adding all individual costs and display the result using a rational number format to avoid decimals. This approach follows Case 1, as all the problem components are directly calculable via Python."
