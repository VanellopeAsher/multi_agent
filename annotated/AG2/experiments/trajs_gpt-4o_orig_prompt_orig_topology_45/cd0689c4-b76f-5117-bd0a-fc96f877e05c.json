You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows.

We know the total number of presents and the total length of ribbon available.\n\nHere is the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Determine the total number of presents by summing the presents for family, buddies, and educators.\n2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of presents to find out how much ribbon can be allocated to each bow.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Total number of presents\nfamily_presents = 6\nbuddies_presents = 4\neducators_presents = 2\ntotal_presents = family_presents + buddies_presents + educators_presents\n\n# Total ribbon length\ntotal_ribbon_length = 144  # inches\n\n# Ribbon per present\nribbon_per_present = total_ribbon_length / total_presents\n\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Using Rational to express the result as a fraction\nribbon_per_present_fraction = Rational(total_ribbon_length, total_presents)\n\nprint(ribbon_per_present_fraction)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the length of ribbon that can be allocated for each present's bow in fraction form."
