You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJenna shares her living space with four other people.

This is a straightforward calculation that can be directly solved with Python by calculating each person's share of the monthly bill and then multiplying it by 12 to get the annual amount.\n\nKey Idea:\n- Split the monthly electricity cost evenly among the five total people.\n- Multiply each person's monthly share by 12 to get the annual contribution.\n\nThis corresponds to Case 1, as the problem can be solved directly with Python code.\n\nLet's write a Python program to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total monthly cost\nmonthly_cost = 100\n\n# Number of people sharing the cost\nnum_people = 5\n\n# Monthly contribution per person\nmonthly_contribution_per_person = Rational(monthly_cost, num_people)\n\n# Annual contribution per person\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_contribution_per_person * 12\n\n# Display the result\nprint(f\"Annual contribution per roommate: {annual_contribution_per_person}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the annual contribution per roommate in its simplest fractional form.
