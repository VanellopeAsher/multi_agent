You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJolene and her friends are celebrating the start of summer with a water balloon battle.

Calculate the total number of balloons prepared initially.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons remaining after the fight to find the number of balloons used.\n\nThis problem can be directly handled with basic arithmetic calculations. Let's proceed to write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\n# total number of sets of balloons\ntotal_sets = 10\n# number of balloons per set\nballoons_per_set = 30\n# total balloons prepared initially\ntotal_initial_balloons = total_sets * balloons_per_set\n\n# balloons remaining after the fight\nballoons_remaining = 12\n\n# balloons used in the fight\nballoons_used = total_initial_balloons - balloons_remaining\n\n# print the result\nprint(balloons_used)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the number of water balloons used in the fight, providing a step-by-step check. The answer will be printed, and you will be able to see the number of balloons that were used.\n\nLet's run this code to get the result."

Total balloons prepared initially = 10 sets × 30 balloons per set = 300 balloons.\n2. Balloons remaining after the fight = 12.\n3. Balloons used = 300 (initially prepared) - 12 (remaining) = 288.\n\nSo the number of balloons used in the fight is \\(\\boxed{288}\\)."
