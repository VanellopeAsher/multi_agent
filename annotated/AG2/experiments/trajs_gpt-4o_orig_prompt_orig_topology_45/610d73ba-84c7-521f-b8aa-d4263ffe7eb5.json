You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPaisley, Reggie, and Lynn went for a run.

We need to find \\( L \\).\n\nWe solve these relationships with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nP = symbols('P')\nR = symbols('R')\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Given distances\nP_value = 4\n\n# Equations based on the problem statement\nequation1 = Eq(R, 5 * P)\nequation2 = Eq(R, L + 3)\n\n# Substitute P_value into the equations\nequation1 = equation1.subs(P, P_value)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (R, L))\n\n# Output the distance that Lynn ran\nprint(solution[L])\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the distance Lynn ran in fraction or integer format."
