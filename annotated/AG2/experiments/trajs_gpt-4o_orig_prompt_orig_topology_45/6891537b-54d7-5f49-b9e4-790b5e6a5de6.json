  "problem": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to determine how many cards Miss Maria gives to her students and then divide that number by 10 to find the number of students, as each student receives 10 cards. Here's the step-by-step process we'll follow:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards: Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards each.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards: Miss Maria has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards each.\n3. Calculate the total number of cards that Miss Maria has in total.\n4. Subtract the 50 cards that she keeps.\n5. Calculate the number of cards Miss Maria gives to her students.\n6. Divide the number of cards given to students by 10 to determine the number of students.\n\nThis problem can be solved directly with Python code because it involves straightforward arithmetic operations. Here's the Python program to solve it:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to use for fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n\n# Total number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n\n# Total number of cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\n\n# Cards kept by Miss Maria\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Each student gets 10 cards\nstudents = Rational(cards_given_to_students, 10)\n\n# Output the number of students\nprint(students)\n```\n\nThis program will print the number of students Miss Maria has. Let's run the code and get the result."
