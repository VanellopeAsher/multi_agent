In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 600 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

Determine the amount of seashells collected by the girls, which is \\( n_g \\) (number of girls) times the number a specific girl collected.\n4. Write an equation to represent the total number of seashells collected by the girls using the provided information.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Since there are 200 kids divided equally into two groups, there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n2. Each boy collects 600 seashells, so the total number of seashells collected by the boys is \\( 100 \\times 600 \\).\n3. Each girl collects a certain amount \\( x \\) of seashells, and the total number collected by the girls is \\( 100 \\times x \\).\n4. According to the problem, the girls brought back the same amount as the boys plus four times as many, so their total should be \\( 5 \\times \\) (the number collected by the boys).\n\nLet's write a Python program using sympy to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let x be the number of seashells collected by each girl\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total shells collected by boys\nboys_shells = 100 * 600\n\n# Equation for shells collected by girls\ngirls_shells_equation = Eq(100 * x, boys_shells + 4 * boys_shells)\n\n# Solve the equation\ngirls_shells_per_girl = solve(girls_shells_equation, x)[0]\n\nprint(girls_shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of seashells collected by each girl."
