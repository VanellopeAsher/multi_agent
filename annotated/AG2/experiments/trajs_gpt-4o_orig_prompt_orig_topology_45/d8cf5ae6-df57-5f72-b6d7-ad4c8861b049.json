  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed the farmer is buying and then determine how much the truck can carry per trip given that the total weight needs to be divided between two trips.\n\n### Key Idea\n1. Calculate the total weight of each type of feed.\n2. Sum up the weights to get the total weight of all the feed.\n3. Divide the total weight by 2 to find out how many pounds the truck can carry on a single trip since the transportation should be done in 2 trips.\n\nLet's break this down and calculate using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the weight of each type of feed:\nsugar_cubes_weight = 2 * 1  # pounds\ncarrots_weight = 4 * 12    # pounds\nhay_weight = 42 * 75       # pounds\noats_weight = 20 * 65      # pounds\n\n# Calculate total weight\ntotal_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight\n\n# The truck needs to carry this in 2 trips\nweight_per_trip = Rational(total_weight, 2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The farm truck can carry {weight_per_trip} pounds per trip.\")\n```\n\nThis code logic will calculate the total weight and determine how many pounds the truck should carry in each trip, using fractions for any calculations.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n1. Sugar Cubes: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) pounds\n2. Carrots: \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) pounds\n3. Hay: \\(42 \\times 75 = 3150\\) pounds\n4. Oats: \\(20 \\times 65 = 1300\\) pounds\n\nNow, calculate the total:\n\\[ 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \\]\n\nThen, divide by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{4500}{2} = 2250 \\]\n\nHence, the farm truck can carry \\(\\boxed{2250}\\) pounds per trip."
