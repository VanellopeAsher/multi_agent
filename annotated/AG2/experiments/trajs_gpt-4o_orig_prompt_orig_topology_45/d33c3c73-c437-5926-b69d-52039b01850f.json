Let's break it down step by step and use Python to assist with any necessary calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Monday's depth:** The initial depth of the tank on Monday is given as 17 feet.\n  \n2. **Tuesday's depth:** On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than it had on Monday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tuesday's depth} = \\text{Monday's depth} + 7 = 17 + 7 = 24 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Wednesday's depth:** On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wednesday's depth} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{Tuesday's depth} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Wednesday's depth:** We'll use Python to compute this value.\n\n5. **Thursday's depth:** On Thursday, the tank's water depth increased by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase on Thursday} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{Tuesday's depth} - \\text{Wednesday's depth})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Thursday's depth} = \\text{Wednesday's depth} + \\text{Increase on Thursday}\n   \\]\n\n### Python Code to Perform Calculations\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial depths\nmonday_depth = 17\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + 7\n\n# Calculate Wednesday's depth using rational arithmetic\nwednesday_depth = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_depth\n\n# Calculate the increase on Thursday\nincrease_thursday = Rational(1, 2) * (tuesday_depth - wednesday_depth)\n\n# Calculate Thursday's depth\nthursday_depth = wednesday_depth + increase_thursday\n\n# Output Thursday's depth in exact form\nprint(thursday_depth)\n```\n\nLet's compute Wednesday's depth and increase on Thursday, then find the depth on Thursday using these results.\n\nUpon executing this code, you will find:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20 \\text{ feet}}\n\\]\nThis is the depth of the water in the tank on Thursday."
