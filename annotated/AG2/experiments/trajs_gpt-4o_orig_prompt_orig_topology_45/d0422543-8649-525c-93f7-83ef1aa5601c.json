You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.

Here's how to approach it:\n\nWe know:\n- Carver's age \\( C = 60 \\).\n- Carver's age is 8 years less than twice the age of his son.\n\nLet the son's age be \\( S \\). According to the problem, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ C = 2S - 8 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( C = 60 \\) in the equation:\n\\[ 60 = 2S - 8 \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation using Python and the sympy package to ensure the son's age is determined using symbolic computation.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nS = symbols('S')\n\n# Create the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(60, 2*S - 8)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, S)\n\n# Print the son's age\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the age of Carver's son, which will be our final answer."
