  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Then, we'll subtract these expenses from her total budget to find out how much money she will have left.\n\n```python\n# Total budget\nbudget = 1500\n\n# Costs of the items Elvira decided to purchase\ncomputer_cost = 1090\nscanner_cost = 157\ncd_burner_cost = 74\nprinter_cost = 102\n\n# Calculate total expenses\ntotal_expenses = computer_cost + scanner_cost + cd_burner_cost + printer_cost\n\n# Calculate the remaining money for the new outfit\nremaining_money = budget - total_expenses\n\n# Print the remaining money using fractions/radical forms instead of decimals\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Convert the amount to a fraction\nremaining_money_fraction = Rational(remaining_money)\n\n# Output the remaining money\nprint(remaining_money_fraction)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount of money Elvira has left for her new outfit in exact form."
