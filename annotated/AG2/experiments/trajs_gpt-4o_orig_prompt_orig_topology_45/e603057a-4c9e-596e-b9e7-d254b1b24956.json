You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSeth is twice as old as Brooke.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we should express the relationship between their ages using algebra. Seth being twice as old as Brooke gives us one equation, and their ages adding to 36 in 3 years gives us another. Using these equations, we can solve for Seth's age.\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step using algebraic equations.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( S \\) be Seth's current age.\n   - Let \\( B \\) be Brooke's current age.\n\n2. **Formulate Equations**:\n   - From the problem, we know \\( S = 2B \\) (Seth is twice as old as Brooke).\n   - In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36: \\( (S + 3) + (B + 3) = 36 \\).\n\n3. **Simplify and Solve**:\n   - From the second equation: \\( S + B + 6 = 36 \\), so \\( S + B = 30 \\).\n   - Now substitute \\( S = 2B \\) into \\( S + B = 30 \\):\n     - \\( 2B + B = 30 \\)\n     - \\( 3B = 30 \\)\n     - Solve for \\( B \\) to find Brooke's age.\n\n4. **Calculate Seth's Age**:\n   - Once \\( B \\) is found, use \\( S = 2B \\) to find Seth's age.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables for Brooke's and Seth's current ages\nB = symbols('B')\n\n# Equation for Seth being twice Brooke's age\nS = 2 * B\n\n# Equation for the sum of their ages in 3 years being 36\nequation = Eq(S + B, 30)\n\n# Solve for Brooke's age\nBrooke_age = solve(equation, B)[0]\n\n# Calculate Seth's age\nSeth_age = 2 * Brooke_age\n\n# Print Seth's age\nprint(Seth_age)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the equations and compute Seth's current age."

Let's check it:\n\nWe solved the equations as follows:\n1. \\( S = 2B \\)\n2. \\( S + B = 30 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( S = 2B \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ 2B + B = 30 \\Rightarrow 3B = 30 \\]\n\nFrom this, we find:\n\\[ B = \\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\]\n\nUsing \\( S = 2B \\), we find:\n\\[ S = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Seth's age is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
