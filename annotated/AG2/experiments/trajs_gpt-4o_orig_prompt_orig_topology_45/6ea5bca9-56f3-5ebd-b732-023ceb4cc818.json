You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has: \\( S = 3P \\).\n\nWe can substitute these equations into Python to solve for \\( B \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the variables\nB, S, P = symbols('B S P')\n\n# Equation 1: B + S + P = 3.41\neq1 = Eq(B + S + P, Rational(341, 100))\n\n# Equation 2: B = S + 0.12\neq2 = Eq(B, S + Rational(12, 100))\n\n# Equation 3: S = 3P\neq3 = Eq(S, 3*P)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (B, S, P))\n\n# Solution for B\nbecca_cards = solution[B]\n\nprint(becca_cards)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the system of equations and give us the number of hundred cards Becca has. \nOnce you execute it, you should get the answer in fractional form, which we'll put inside \\(\\boxed{}\\)."
