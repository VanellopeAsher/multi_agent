You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

Calculate the sum of the known scores.\n2. Add the unknown score \\( x \\) to this sum.\n3. Divide the total sum by the total number of scores to set up an equation.\n4. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Known scores\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\nnum_scores = len(scores) + 1  # Including the unknown score\nmean_score = 70\n\n# Calculate the sum of the known scores\nsum_known_scores = sum(scores)\n\n# Let x be the unknown score\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation for the mean\nequation = Eq((sum_known_scores + x) / num_scores, mean_score)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nforgotten_score = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the forgotten score\nprint(f\"The forgotten score is {forgotten_score}\")\n```\n\nNow let's continue with the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Output the boxed result\nfrom sympy import latex\nprint(f\"The forgotten score is \\\\boxed{{{latex(forgotten_score)}}}\")\n```\n\nThis code will solve for the missing score, ensuring we present the result in the specified format."
