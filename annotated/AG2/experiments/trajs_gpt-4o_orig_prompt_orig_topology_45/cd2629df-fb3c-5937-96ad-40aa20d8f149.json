For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month after accounting for the fixed monthly payments and the interest.\n\nKey idea:\nThe problem can be solved using Python by calculating the total amount Stephen owes, his monthly payments, and determining the final payment to be made in the twelfth month.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step and solve it:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return including the interest.\n2. Subtract the total payments made over the first 11 months.\n3. The remaining amount will be the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.\n\nHere is the code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial borrowed amount\nprincipal = 300\n\n# Interest rate of 2%\ninterest_rate = Rational(2, 100)\n\n# Total amount including interest\ntotal_amount = principal * (1 + interest_rate)\n\n# Monthly payment for the first 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\ntotal_paid_first_11_months = monthly_payment * 11\n\n# Amount to be paid in the twelfth month\nfinal_payment = total_amount - total_paid_first_11_months\n\n# Print the final payment in fraction form\nprint(final_payment)\n```\n\nThis will give us the amount Stephen needs to pay his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchase, in a fraction form to keep it precise."
