You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We are not given the total length of ribbon available, so I'll assume that we need to report this information in terms of the number of bows.\n\n**Key Idea: Case 1**: If the total amount of ribbon is given, we can programmatically calculate how many inches of ribbon Monica can use per bow.\n\nHere's how you can write the Python code to calculate the number of gifts:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of gifts Monica has\ntotal_gifts = 6 + 4 + 2\n\n# Define total ribbon in inches (example value)\ntotal_ribbon_inches = 100  # You can replace this with the actual total if specified\n\n# Calculate inches of ribbon per gift bow\nribbon_per_bow = Rational(total_ribbon_inches, total_gifts)\n\n# Output\nprint(ribbon_per_bow)\n```\n\nYou can replace `total_ribbon_inches` with the actual available ribbon length if that information was given. The code above calculates the amount of ribbon per bow using the `Rational` class from `sympy` to keep it in fractional form instead of decimal. Please specify the total ribbon length if you have it. Otherwise, we assume the above example."
