You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home.

Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \\( x \\).\n2. According to the problem, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the students have a desktop computer.\n3. This implies that \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the students do not have a desktop computer.\n4. We know the number of students who do not have a desktop computer is 30.\n5. Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times x = 30\\).\n6. We can solve this equation to find \\( x \\).\n\nLet's calculate using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq((1/3) * x, 30)\n\n# Solve the equation\nstudents = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the number of students\nprint(students)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of students. The expected result is the value that satisfies the equation \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times x = 30\\)."
