We will use Python to handle these calculations.\n\n**Key idea**: This problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\nLet's break down the cost calculations and solve it step by step.\n\n1. Compute the total cost of the hamburgers.\n2. Compute the total cost of the potato fries.\n3. Assume we don't have the cost of the drinks, and clarify it in the input.\n4. Calculate the total cost and subtract from $50 to find the change.\n\nLet's proceed with the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Costs of individual items\nhamburger_cost = 4\nfries_cost = Rational(30, 100)  # 0.30 dollars\n\n# Quantities\nhamburgers = 5\nfries = 10\n\n# Total costs\ntotal_hamburgers_cost = hamburgers * hamburger_cost\ntotal_fries_cost = fries * fries_cost\n\n# Assuming we do not know the cost of fruit drinks, let's denote it as a variable\nfruit_drink_cost = symbols('fruit_drink_cost')\n\n# Cans of fruit drinks\nfruit_drinks = 5\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = total_hamburgers_cost + total_fries_cost + fruit_drinks * fruit_drink_cost\n\n# Amount given\namount_given = 50\n\n# Calculate change\nchange = amount_given - total_cost\n\n# Output the expression for change\nprint(f'Change expression: {change}')\n```\n\nThis code will help you establish the relationship with an unknown variable `fruit_drink_cost`; you need to define this variable or provide its value to find the exact change."
