You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

This math problem involves straightforward arithmetic, so it falls under Case 1, where we can solve it directly using Python.\n\nKey Idea: \n1. Determine Charmaine's current age.\n2. Calculate her age 4 years from now.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let x be Charmaine's current age\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# According to the problem, in 12 years, Charmaine will be 16\n# So, x + 12 = 16\nequation = Eq(x + 12, 16)\n\n# Solve for Charmaine's current age\ncharmaine_current_age = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate Charmaine's age after 4 years\ncharmaine_age_in_4_years = charmaine_current_age + 4\n\n# Print the result\nprint('Charmaine\\'s age after 4 years:', charmaine_age_in_4_years)\n```\n\nThis Python code uses sympy to solve the equation to find Charmaine's current age, then calculates her age after 4 years. Let's determine the answer:\n\nCharmaine's current age is \\( x = 4 \\) (since \\( 4 + 12 = 16 \\)), so in 4 years, her age will be \\( 4 + 4 = 8 \\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{8}\\)"

We established the equation based on the problem statement: In 12 years, Charmaine will be 16.\n2. From this, we solved for Charmaine's current age: \n   \\[\n   x + 12 = 16 \\implies x = 4 \n   \\]\n   So Charmaine is currently 4 years old.\n3. We then determined her age 4 years from now:\n   \\[\n   4 + 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Charmaine's age after 4 years from now is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).\n\nIf you have another problem or need additional assistance, please feel free to let me know!"
