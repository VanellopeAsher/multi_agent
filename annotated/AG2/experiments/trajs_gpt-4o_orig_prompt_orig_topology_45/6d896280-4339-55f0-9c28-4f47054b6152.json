You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Let \\( x \\) be the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday (and Wednesday).\n2. Since they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, they also make \\( x \\) chimichangas on Wednesday.\n3. On Friday, they make double the amount, so they make \\( 2x \\) chimichangas.\n\nThe total number is given by:\n\\[ x + x + 2x = 500 \\]\n\nWe will solve this equation to find \\( x \\).\n\n### Python Code:\n\nWe can use Python and the sympy library to solve this equation, keeping everything in exact form (no decimals).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(x + x + 2*x, 500)\n\n# Solve the equation\nchimichangas_tuesday = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(chimichangas_tuesday)\n```\n\nThis code will provide the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday. Let's run it to find the answer."
