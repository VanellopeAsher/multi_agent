You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

This problem can be directly solved using Python.\n\nFirst, we'll determine the number of hash browns produced by one potato, and then we'll multiply that rate by 960 potatoes.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\npotatoes_1 = 60\nhash_browns_1 = 360\n\n# Number of hash browns per potato\nhash_browns_per_potato = Rational(hash_browns_1, potatoes_1)\n\n# Number of potatoes to use\npotatoes_2 = 960\n\n# Calculate the number of hash browns for 960 potatoes\nhash_browns_2 = hash_browns_per_potato * potatoes_2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(hash_browns_2)\n```\n\nThis code will output the number of hash browns made from 960 potatoes. Let's run the code to find the answer."
