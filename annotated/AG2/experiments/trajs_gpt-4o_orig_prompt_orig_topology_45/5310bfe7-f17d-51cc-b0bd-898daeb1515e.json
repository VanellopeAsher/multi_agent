You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Since Richie scored 90 goals, the following relationships can be established:\n\n- Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n- Richie also scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\nWe can derive the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna from these equations:\n\n1. \\( \\text{Richie's goals} = \\text{Mark's goals} + 30 \\)\n2. \\( \\text{Richie's goals} = \\text{Anna's goals} + 55 \\)\n\nLet's translate these into Python code to find the goals scored by Mark and Anna, and then compute the total goals scored by all three teenagers.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to handle symbolic mathematics\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for Mark's and Anna's goals\nmark_goals, anna_goals = symbols('mark_goals anna_goals')\n\n# Richie's goals\nrichie_goals = 90\n\n# Create equations based on the given information\neq1 = Eq(richie_goals, mark_goals + 30)\neq2 = Eq(richie_goals, anna_goals + 55)\n\n# Solve these equations to find Mark's and Anna's goals\nmark_goals_solution = solve(eq1, mark_goals)[0]\nanna_goals_solution = solve(eq2, anna_goals)[0]\n\n# Calculate the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers\ntotal_goals = richie_goals + mark_goals_solution + anna_goals_solution\n\n# Output all the results in a readable format\nprint(f\"Richie's goals: {richie_goals}\")\nprint(f\"Mark's goals: {mark_goals_solution}\")\nprint(f\"Anna's goals: {anna_goals_solution}\")\nprint(f\"Total goals scored by all three teenagers: {total_goals}\")\n```\n\nRun this code to get the number of goals each of them scored and the total number of goals scored altogether.
