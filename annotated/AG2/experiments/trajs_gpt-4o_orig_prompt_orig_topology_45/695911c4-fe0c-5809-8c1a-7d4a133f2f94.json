You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

Calculate the cost of visits for the first 10 years before the price increase.\n2. Calculate the cost of visits for the additional 3 years after the price increase.\n3. Sum the total cost for all visits over 13 years.\n\nThe key math operation is calculating the cost increase, which is a simple percentage increase.\n\nLet's write a Python program to compute the total cost:\n\n```python\n# initial cost per visit\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10\n\n# number of visits per year\nvisits_per_year = 3\n\n# duration before price increase\nyears_before_increase = 10\n\n# price increase percentage\nincrease_percentage = 150  # equivalent to 1.5 times increase\n\n# duration after price increase\nyears_after_increase = 3\n\n# Total cost before the increase\ntotal_cost_before_increase = initial_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_before_increase\n\n# New cost per visit after the increase\nnew_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit * (1 + increase_percentage / 100)\n\n# Total cost after the increase\ntotal_cost_after_increase = new_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_after_increase\n\n# Total cost for all visits\ntotal_cost = total_cost_before_increase + total_cost_after_increase\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the total cost Pauline spends on all her visits to the museum over the 13 years.
