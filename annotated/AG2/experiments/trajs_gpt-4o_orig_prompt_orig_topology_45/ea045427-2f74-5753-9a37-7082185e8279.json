You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each.

We will use Python to handle these calculations.\n\nKey Idea:\nThe problem can be solved using Python directly by calculating the cost of notebooks, the cost of a ballpen, the cost of a pencil case, and then summing everything up for the total cost. This is Case 1.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the total spending:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of five notebooks.\n2. Calculate the cost of one ballpen.\n3. Calculate the cost of one notebook and two ballpens.\n4. Calculate the cost of the pencil case, which is twice the cost of one notebook and two ballpens.\n5. Sum all the costs to find the total amount William spent.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the costs\ncost_of_notebook = Rational(3, 2)  # $1.50 in fraction form\ncost_of_ballpen = Rational(1, 2)   # $0.50 in fraction form\n\n# Calculate the total cost of notebooks\ntotal_cost_notebooks = 5 * cost_of_notebook\n\n# Calculate the cost of one ballpen\ntotal_cost_ballpen = cost_of_ballpen\n\n# Calculate the cost of one notebook and two ballpens\ncost_of_one_notebook_and_two_ballpens = cost_of_notebook + 2 * cost_of_ballpen\n\n# Calculate the cost of a pencil case\ncost_of_pencil_case = 2 * cost_of_one_notebook_and_two_ballpens\n\n# Calculate the total amount spent\ntotal_amount_spent = total_cost_notebooks + total_cost_ballpen + cost_of_pencil_case\n\n# Print the total amount in fraction form\nprint(total_amount_spent)\n```\n\nRunning this code will provide the total amount William spent on all the items."
