You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

The calculation tells us that there are 27 unicorns in total in the world. \n\nNow, let's determine how many unicorns are not in Scotland, since \"how many are left in the world\" implies unicorns not in Scotland.\n\nTo find this:\n\n1. From our earlier calculation, we have:\n   - Total unicorns worldwide: 27\n   - Unicorns in Scotland: 9 (which was calculated as \\( x = 9 \\))\n\n2. So, unicorns outside Scotland = Total unicorns - Unicorns in Scotland\n   - Unicorns outside Scotland = \\( 27 - 9 \\)\n\nLet's compute this.\n\n```python\nunicorns_in_scotland = total_scottish_unicorns\nunicorns_outside_scotland = total_world_unicorns - unicorns_in_scotland\n\nprint(unicorns_outside_scotland)\n```\n\nAfter calculating this using the steps above, the number of unicorns outside Scotland is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).
