You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.

Let's follow Case 1, where the problem can be solved directly using Python.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many eggs Claire uses in 12 weeks. Claire uses 3 eggs per day. We need to find the total number of eggs she uses in 12 weeks and then convert that number into dozens of eggs.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the answer:\n\n```python\n# Number of eggs Claire uses per day\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# Number of days in 12 weeks\ndays_in_12_weeks = 12 * 7  # 12 weeks * 7 days per week\n\n# Total number of eggs used in 12 weeks\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_day * days_in_12_weeks\n\n# Convert eggs to dozens (1 dozen = 12 eggs)\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / 12\n\n# Print the result\nprint(dozens_of_eggs)\n```\n\nNow let's run the code to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks."
