You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

      "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step. James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers around his backyard fence, which is a rectangle measuring \\(20\\) feet by \\(15\\) feet. He also has a tree, but since he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree, we only need to calculate the amount of crepe paper required to go around the perimeter of the fence.\n\n**Key Idea**: \nThe problem can be solved directly using Python by calculating the perimeter of the rectangular fence.\n\n**Solution**:\nTo find the total length of crepe paper needed, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nIn this case, the length is \\(20\\) feet and the width is \\(15\\) feet. Let's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\nlength = 20\nwidth = 15\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nRun this code to get the number of feet of crepe paper James needs to buy."
