You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJake is shopping at a clothing store.

T-shirt cost: Calculate the cost of 10 full-price T-shirts and 10 half-price T-shirts.\n2. Shoes cost: Calculate the price after a 40% discount.\n3. Total cost: Sum the cost of the T-shirts and shoes.\n\nI'll use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices\ntshirt_price = 80\ntshirt_count = 20\nshoe_original_price = 400\nshoe_discount = Rational(40, 100)\n\n# Calculate total T-shirt cost\nfull_price_tshirts = tshirt_count // 2\nhalf_price_tshirts = full_price_tshirts\ntshirt_total_cost = full_price_tshirts * tshirt_price + half_price_tshirts * Rational(tshirt_price, 2)\n\n# Calculate total shoe cost\nshoe_discounted_price = shoe_original_price * (1 - shoe_discount)\n\n# Calculate total expense\ntotal_cost = tshirt_total_cost + shoe_discounted_price\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nOnce the code runs, it will display the total cost in an exact fraction form.
