Let's go through the solution step by step:\n\nGiven:\n- Each pack costs $4 and contains 5 canvas bags.\n- Each canvas bag is sold for $8, and the total profit is $160.\n\nWe set up the profit equation correctly as:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 5x - 4x = 160\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n40x - 4x = 160\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n36x = 160\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{160}{36} = \\frac{40}{9}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents the number of packs, and \\( \\frac{40}{9} \\) is not an integer, it indicates that the calculation might be incorrect.\n\nLet's verify the correct calculation through reasoning:\n\n1. Each bag's profit is \\( 8 - \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{40}{5} - \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{36}{5} \\).\n2. The total profit from \\( 5x \\) bags is \\( \\frac{36}{5} \\times 5x = 36x \\).\n3. So, we need to solve \\( 36x = 160 \\).\n\nThis simplification error means my setup incorrectly represented understanding the contribution by explaining each bag instead of checking accurate whole packs easy summation. \n\nHence, the fractional result does not correctly solve the problem definition, needing re-examining the sales quotient or initial variables."
