You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total amount of time John spent on activities during his vacation. We can determine this by setting up an equation based on the information given. Since this is primarily a mathematical calculation, we can go with Case 1, which involves using Python code to calculate the required values.\n\nKey points from the problem:\n\n1. John spent 60 hours boating.\n2. He spent half of his boating time swimming, which is \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) hours swimming.\n3. John watched 30 shows, each of 20 hours, totaling \\( 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\) hours.\n4. These 600 hours constitute 30% of the total time.\n5. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.\n\nWe need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\nWe will use this information to determine the total time spent and how much of that was spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let T be the total time John spent\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# 30% of the total time was spent watching shows, which was 600 hours\nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, 600)\n\n# Solve for the total time T\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# 40% of the time was spent sightseeing\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time\n\n# Print the result in hours\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, you will find the amount of time John spent sightseeing."
