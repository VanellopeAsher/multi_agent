You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11.

The ratio of their ages: \\( \\frac{7}{11} \\)\n2. The total age: 162 years\n\nWe need to calculate Allen's age ten years in the future.\n\n### Solution Plan\nLet's use the following steps:\n1. Let Darrell's age be \\( 7x \\) and Allen's age be \\( 11x \\) because their age ratio is 7:11.\n2. Write the equation for their total age: \\( 7x + 11x = 162 \\).\n3. Solve for \\( x \\).\n4. Calculate Allen's current age, \\( 11x \\).\n5. Determine Allen's age 10 years from now by adding 10 to his current age.\n\nLet's implement it in Python using the sympy library:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nage_equation = Eq(7*x + 11*x, 162)\n\n# Solve for 'x'\nx_value = solve(age_equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate Allen's current age\nallen_current_age = 11 * x_value\n\n# Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now\nallen_age_future = allen_current_age + 10\n\n# Display the result\nprint(allen_age_future)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will yield Allen's age 10 years from now."
