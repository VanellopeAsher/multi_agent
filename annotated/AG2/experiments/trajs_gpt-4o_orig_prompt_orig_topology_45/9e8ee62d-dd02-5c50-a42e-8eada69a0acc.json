You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

Determine the height after the first week.\n2. Calculate the height after the second week (since it doubled in height).\n3. Determine the amount it grew in the third week by subtracting the height after the second week from the final height after the third week.\n\nWe'll use these calculations to determine how many inches the beanstalk grew in the third week.\n\nLet's write the Python code:\n\n```python\n# Initial height after the first week\nheight_after_week1 = 3\n\n# Height after the second week (it doubles)\nheight_after_week2 = 2 * height_after_week1\n\n# Final height after the third week\nheight_after_week3 = 10\n\n# The growth in the third week\ngrow_in_week3 = height_after_week3 - height_after_week2\n\nprint(grow_in_week3)\n```\n\nNow, run this code to find out how much the beanstalk grew in the third week."
