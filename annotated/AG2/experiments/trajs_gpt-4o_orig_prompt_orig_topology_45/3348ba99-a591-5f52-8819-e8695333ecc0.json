You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark took a test yesterday that consisted of 7.5 sets of ten questions.

After determining the number of complete sets for each test, we can find how many sets were left incomplete.\n\n### Key Idea:\nUse the given rate and time constraints to compute the number of completed sets for each test and calculate the difference from the total sets to find the incomplete sets.\n\n#### Step-by-step plan:\n1. Calculate how many sets of ten questions Mark could have completed for each test given the time constraints.\n2. Subtract the number of completed sets from the total number of sets for each test separately.\n3. Sum the incomplete sets from both tests to get the final result.\n\nSince this problem can be solved with Python code directly, let's write a program to solve it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given rates\nrate = Rational(1, 2)  # sets of ten questions per hour\n\n# Test 1\ntotal_sets_test1 = Rational(75, 10)  # 7.5 sets of ten questions\nallowed_time_test1 = Rational(8, 10)  # 0.8 sets of ten hours\ncompleted_sets_test1 = rate * allowed_time_test1  # sets completed in given time\n\n# Test 2\ntotal_sets_test2 = Rational(100, 10)  # 10 sets of ten questions\nallowed_time_test2 = Rational(6, 10)  # 0.6 sets of ten hours\ncompleted_sets_test2 = rate * allowed_time_test2  # sets completed in given time\n\n# Calculate incomplete sets \nincomplete_sets_test1 = total_sets_test1 - completed_sets_test1\nincomplete_sets_test2 = total_sets_test2 - completed_sets_test2\ntotal_incomplete_sets = incomplete_sets_test1 + incomplete_sets_test2\n\n# Print the results in fractional form\nprint(f\"Incomplete sets in Test 1: {incomplete_sets_test1}\")\nprint(f\"Incomplete sets in Test 2: {incomplete_sets_test2}\")\nprint(f\"Total incomplete sets: {total_incomplete_sets}\")\n```\n\nLet's compute these results."
