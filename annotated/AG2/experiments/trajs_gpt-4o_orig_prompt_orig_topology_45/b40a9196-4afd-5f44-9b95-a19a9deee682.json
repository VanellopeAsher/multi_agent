You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

The total cost of all items, including the 10% tax on non-food items, is indeed 16 dollars.\n\nTo break it down as per the calculation:\n- Milk and eggs are food items, so no tax is applied to them: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) dollars.\n- Light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items:\n  - Light bulbs: \\(3 \\times 1.1 = 3.3\\) dollars\n  - Cups: \\(3 \\times 1.1 = 3.3\\) dollars\n  - Roach traps: \\(4 \\times 1.1 = 4.4\\) dollars\n- Total from non-food items: \\(3.3 + 3.3 + 4.4 = 11\\) dollars.\n- Total cost: \\(5 + 11 = 16\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total cost including tax is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) dollars."
