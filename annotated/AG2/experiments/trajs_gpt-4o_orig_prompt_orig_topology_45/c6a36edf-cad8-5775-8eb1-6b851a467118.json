  "problem": "Upon the conclusion of the academic year, Kate requested her instructor for the 3 containers of 64 crayons that were all reduced to tiny fragments. The instructor consented. Kate brought the crayons to her house and chose to create crayon muffins by fusing 8 tiny fragments of crayons in a muffin tin that she heated in an oven for a short period.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nUpon the conclusion of the academic year, Kate requested her instructor for the 3 containers of 64 crayons that were all reduced to tiny fragments.

Therefore, the total number of crayon fragments is \\(3 \\times 64\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of muffins she can make:** Since each muffin requires 8 crayon fragments, divide the total number of fragments by 8.\n\n3. **Calculate the total revenue:** Multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin ($1.50).\n\nWe can implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\n# Total number of crayons\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# Number of crayons per muffin\ncrayons_per_muffin = 8\n\n# Calculate the number of muffins\nnumber_of_muffins = total_crayons // crayons_per_muffin\n\n# Price per muffin\nprice_per_muffin = 1.50\n\n# Calculate total revenue\ntotal_revenue = number_of_muffins * price_per_muffin\n\nprint(total_revenue)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the total amount of money that Kate can earn by selling her crayon muffins.
