You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard.

We'll be using algebraic expressions to find the solution.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. The height of the shortest tree is given as 60 feet.\n2. The second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest tree. So, the height of the second tree is \\(60 + 50\\) feet.\n3. The tallest tree is twice the height of the sum of the shortest and second tree.\n\nWe can solve this directly with Python code using these expressions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the height of the shortest and second tree\nh_shortest = 60  # height of the shortest tree in feet\nh_second = h_shortest + 50  # height of the second tree in feet\n\n# Total height of the shortest and second tree combined\nh_combined = h_shortest + h_second\n\n# The tallest tree is twice the combined height\nh_tallest = 2 * h_combined\n\n# Output the height of the tallest tree\nprint(h_tallest)\n```\n\nWhen you run the code, you should find the height of the tallest tree. Let's evaluate this."
