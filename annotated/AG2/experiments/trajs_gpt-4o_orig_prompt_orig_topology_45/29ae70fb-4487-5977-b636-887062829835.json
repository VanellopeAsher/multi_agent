Since this problem involves a calculation that can be directly performed, we'll use Case 1 and write a Python program to solve it.\n\nInitially, let's calculate the threshold number of classes Manny needs to attend to satisfy the cost requirement. If he attends \\( a \\) classes, the cost per class is \\( \\frac{60}{a} \\). We need to satisfy the constraint that this value is not greater than $10.\n\nHere's how we'll calculate it:\n\n1. Set up the equation: \\(\\frac{60}{a} \\leq 10\\).\n2. Solve for \\( a \\).\n\nLet's write a Python program to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable\na = symbols('a', positive=True, integer=True)\n\n# Solve the inequality\ninequality = 60 / a <= 10\n\n# Solve for a\nmin_classes_to_attend = solve(inequality, a)\n\n# Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss\ntotal_classes = 10\nclasses_missed = total_classes - min_classes_to_attend[0]\n\nprint(\"Manny can miss a maximum of\", classes_missed, \"Karate classes.\")\n```\n\nSimply run this program, and it will provide you with the number of classes Manny can safely miss. After solving this, we find the boxed answer as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
