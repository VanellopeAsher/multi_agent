You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn is a carpenter.

This is a straightforward calculation problem, so we will proceed with Case 1 by writing a simple Python program to perform the calculations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Calculate the cost of the 40 wooden tables at $200 each.\n2. Calculate the cost of the 20 roof frames at $100 each.\n3. Add the costs from steps 1 and 2 to find the total amount Ali has to pay.\n\nNow, let's write the code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Number of wooden tables and their price\nnumber_of_tables = 40\nprice_per_table = 200\n\n# Number of roof frames and their price\nnumber_of_frames = 20\nprice_per_frame = 100\n\n# Calculate total cost for tables\ntotal_cost_tables = number_of_tables * price_per_table\n\n# Calculate total cost for roof frames\ntotal_cost_frames = number_of_frames * price_per_frame\n\n# Calculate total amount Ali has to pay\ntotal_amount = total_cost_tables + total_cost_frames\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_amount)\n```\n\nNow, run this code to find out how much Ali has to pay John."
