You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are 80 deer in a field.  30 percent of them are bucks.  50 percent of the bucks are 6 points.

We'll calculate the number of bucks, then find 50 percent of those bucks that are 6 points.\n\nHere is how we will solve it:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bucks as 30 percent of the total deer.\n2. Calculate the number of 6 point bucks as 50 percent of these bucks.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of deer\ntotal_deer = 80\n\n# Percentage of bucks\npercent_bucks = Rational(30, 100)\n\n# Percentage of 6 point bucks\npercent_6_point = Rational(50, 100)\n\n# Calculate the number of bucks\nnumber_of_bucks = total_deer * percent_bucks\n\n# Calculate the number of 6 point bucks\nnumber_of_6_point_bucks = number_of_bucks * percent_6_point\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_6_point_bucks)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of 6 point bucks in the field."
