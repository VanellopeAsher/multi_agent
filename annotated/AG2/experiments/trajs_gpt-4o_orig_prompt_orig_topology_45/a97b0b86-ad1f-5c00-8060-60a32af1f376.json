Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

This will be solved using algebraic methods with Python's sympy package.\n\n**Key Idea**: We will calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples, then set up an equation for the total cost including the pizza. Then, we will solve for the number of boxes of pizza.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.\n2.

The result will be displayed in exact form using the print function, adhering to the initial problem requirements."
