You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can directly calculate the amount of protein John gets per week based on his daily intake of mushrooms.\n\nKey Idea:\nFor this problem, we can use Python to perform the calculations required to determine how many grams of protein John consumes in a week.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Determine the amount of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n2. Calculate the amount of protein John consumes daily.\n3. Calculate the weekly protein intake.\n\nFor each 150 grams of mushrooms, there are 4 grams of protein. John consumes 300 grams per day, so the amount of protein he consumes per day can be calculated using a simple proportion.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Amount of mushrooms in grams and corresponding protein\nmushroom_weight = 150\nprotein_per_mushroom_weight = 4\n\n# John's daily intake in grams\njohn_daily_intake = 300\n\n# Calculate protein per gram\nprotein_per_gram = Rational(protein_per_mushroom_weight, mushroom_weight)\n\n# Calculate daily protein intake\ndaily_protein_intake = john_daily_intake * protein_per_gram\n\n# Calculate weekly protein intake (7 days in a week)\nweekly_protein_intake = daily_protein_intake * 7\n\n# Output the result\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\nThe Python code above calculates the weekly protein intake in fractional form. Let's run this code to get the answer in terms of grams of protein."

      "content": "Great! Based on the calculation:\n\n- John consumes 8 grams of protein per day since \\( \\frac{4}{150} \\times 300 = 8 \\).\n- Over the course of a week, this results in \\( 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\) grams of protein.\n\nTherefore, John gets \\(\\boxed{56}\\) grams of protein per week."
