You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.

We can calculate how much Gerald earned in total during the week and then determine how much he spent by subtracting the amount he saved from his total earnings.\n\nKey idea: \n1. Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week.\n2. Subtract the amount he saved from his total earnings to find out how much he spent.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this problem:\n\n```python\n# Total number of days Gerald worked\ndays_worked = 7\n\n# Daily wage\ndaily_wage = 30\n\n# Total earnings in the week\ntotal_earnings = days_worked * daily_wage\n\n# Total savings\ntotal_savings = 110\n\n# Amount spent\namount_spent = total_earnings - total_savings\n\n# Print the amount spent\nprint(amount_spent)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount Gerald spent."
