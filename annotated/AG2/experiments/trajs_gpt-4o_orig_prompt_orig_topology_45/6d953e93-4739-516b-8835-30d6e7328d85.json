  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided and solve them to find the number of car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings for Thursday.\n2. Set up an equation for the earnings on Friday in terms of the number of car tires repaired.\n3. Use the fact that the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday to set up an equation and solve it.\n\nLet's proceed with solving the problem using the given information.\n\n**1. Calculate earnings on Thursday:**\n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.\n- Earnings from truck tires: \\(6 \\times 60\\)\n- Earnings from car tires: \\(4 \\times 40\\)\n\n**2. Total earnings on Thursday:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Thursday earnings} = 6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40 \\]\n\n**3. Set up earnings for Friday:**\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n- Earnings from car tires on Friday: \\( x \\times 40 \\)\n\n**4. Equation from the earnings difference:**\n\nThe mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday:\n\n\\[ (6 \\times 60) + (4 \\times 40) = (x \\times 40) + 40 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve the equation. We'll use Python to do the calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate Thursday's earnings\nthursday_earnings = 6 * 60 + 4 * 40\n\n# Setup the equation for the earnings on Friday\nequation = Eq(thursday_earnings, 40 * x + 40)\n\n# Solve the equation\nfriday_car_tires = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(friday_car_tires)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of car tires repaired on Friday."
