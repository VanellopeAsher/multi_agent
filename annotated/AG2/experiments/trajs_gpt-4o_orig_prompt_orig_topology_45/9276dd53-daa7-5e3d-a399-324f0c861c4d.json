You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Here's how we will approach it:\n\nKey Idea: We are given that the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. With this information, we can calculate the total number of items.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. We know Dominick saw 2000 helmets.\n2. The number of robots is half the number of helmets.\n3. The number of footballs is twice the number of helmets.\n4. Finally, we calculate the total number of items by summing the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to help in mathematical calculations\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# Number of robots is half the number of helmets\nrobots = helmets / 2\n\n# Number of footballs is twice the number of helmets\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\n# Total number of items is the sum of robots, helmets, and footballs\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\n\n# Use Rational for fractions; here, it will not affect as we have integers, but it's for completeness\nprint(Rational(total_items))\n```\n\nThis code calculates and prints the total number of items Dominick saw in the team's changing room. Let's run the code to find the total number of items."
