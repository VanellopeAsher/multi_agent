You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours. He then works double that duration on Wednesday. On Thursday, he puts in 2 hours less than his Wednesday's work hours. What is the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days?"

He worked double that duration on Wednesday, so we'll multiply Tuesday's hours by 2.\n3. On Thursday, he worked 2 hours less than Wednesday, so we'll subtract 2 from Wednesday's work hours.\n4. Finally, we'll add the hours worked each day to get the total.\n\nLet's now write Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the hours Bruce worked on Tuesday\ntuesday_hours = 5\n\n# calculate the hours Bruce worked on Wednesday\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\n\n# calculate the hours Bruce worked on Thursday\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# calculate the total hours Bruce worked over these three days\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\n\n# print the result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\nBy running above code we will get our answer."
