You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs.

We know that there were 10 eggs that were not found by anyone. The friends found all the other eggs. So, to get the number of eggs the friends found, we have to subtract the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the eggs that were not found by anyone from the total number of eggs.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the total number of eggs the team hid. But it is not required for our calculations. This problem can be solved by simple subtraction in Python. \n\nIt's a case 1 problem. Let's calculate this."
