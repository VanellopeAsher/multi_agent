  "problem": "Greta wanted brownies for her birthday.  She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, each cake has 4 strawberries. At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.
