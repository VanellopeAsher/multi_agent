So in total, they had 19 + 50 = 69 bandages.\n- On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day.\n- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. So they added 50 * 2 = 100 bandages and used 0.5 * 50 = 25 bandages.\n- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n```python\n# Initial number of bandages plus one bulk pack\ninitial_bandages = 19 \nbulk_pack = 50\ntotal_first_day = initial_bandages + bulk_pack \n\n# Amount of bandages used on the second day\nused_second_day = 10\n\n# Total bandages at the start of the third day (subtracting what they used on the second day)\ntotal_third_day_start = total_first_day - used_second_day\n\n# Total bandages after ordering two bulk packs and using half on the third day\ntotal_third_day_end = total_third_day_start + 2*bulk_pack - 0.5*bulk_pack\n\n# Therefore, the equation we form for the total bandages at the end of the third day is\n# total_third_day_end = 78, we can solve this equation to find the amount of bandages used on the first day\n\n```\nLet's solve this equation.\n"
