My apologies for any confusion caused by this oversight.\n\nConsidering this, without the specific value of how many boxes Mrs. Harrington originally bought, it's not possible to obtain an absolute number of oranges she sold. Instead, we can express the number of oranges sold in terms of `oranges_in_box`. \n\nHowever, based on the calculation, we can interpret that Mrs. Harrington sold three times the number of oranges in one box, after giving away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 to her sister, and keeping 1/4 of the rest for herself.\n\nSo the formula `3*oranges_in_box` giving the number of the oranges Mrs. Harrington sold holds true for each box of oranges if the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington originally bought is the solution to the equation. \n\nIn conclusion, with given conditions and using the provided formula, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is three times the number of oranges in one box.\n\n$\\boxed{3 \\times \\text{{oranges\\_in\\_box}}}$"
