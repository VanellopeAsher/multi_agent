You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries.

We have three equations from the problem:\n1. R + J + Rb = 6000 (The sum of all cherries)\n2. Rb = R + 1000 (Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard)\n3. Rb = 3000 (Robert has 3000 cherries)\n\nThis can be solved using Python sympy library.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Defines the symbols\nR, J, Rb = symbols('R J Rb')\n\n# Defines the system of equations\nequation1 = Eq(R + J + Rb, 6000)\nequation2 = Eq(Rb, R + 1000)\nequation3 = Eq(Rb, 3000)\n\n# Solves the system of equations\nresults = solve((equation1, equation2, equation3), (R, J, Rb))\n\n# Calculates the difference between number of cherries Robert has and Jerry has\ndifference = results[Rb] - results[J]\n\n# Prints the result\nprint('Robert has', difference, 'more cherries than Jerry.')\n```"
