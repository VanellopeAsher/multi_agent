You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOf the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic.

Number of semi-automatic cars among the available cars: 4 (Because none of the semi-automatic cars are mentioned as being under maintenance or rented out)\n\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the remaining available cars that are semi-automatic. \n\nSo, the key idea is to calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available cars by finding the ratio of the number of semi-automatic cars to the number of total available cars and then multiplying by 100.\n\nPython code can help us calculate this percentage. \n\nLet's write Python code to compute this."
