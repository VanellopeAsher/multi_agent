We already know that his neighbours and the online fund contributed $500 and $1500 respectively. We need to find out how much his friend gave him.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Calculate how much the neighbours and the online fund have collectively donated.\n2. Consider this amount and the friend's donation as the total collection that needs to be three times less than the lawyer's contribution.\n3. So, we can write an equation for the lawyer's contribution: $6600 = 3 * (neighbours donation + online fund donation + friend's donation).\n4. Using the equation, we can compute the friend's donation.\n\nLet's carry out these steps."
