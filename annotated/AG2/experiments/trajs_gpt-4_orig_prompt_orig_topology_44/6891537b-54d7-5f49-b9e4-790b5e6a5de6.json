  "problem": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "Key Idea: To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has by summing the total basketball cards and total baseball cards. After Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, we subtract these from the total to find out how many cards Miss Maria gave to her students. If each student receives ten cards, we can find out the number of students by dividing the remaining cards by ten.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# calculate total cards Maria has\ntotal_basketball_cards = 6 * 25\ntotal_baseball_cards = 5 * 40\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards\n\n# calculate how many cards Maria gave to her students\ncards_for_students = total_cards - 50\n\n# calculate number of students\nnumber_of_students = cards_for_students / 10\nprint(number_of_students)\n```"
