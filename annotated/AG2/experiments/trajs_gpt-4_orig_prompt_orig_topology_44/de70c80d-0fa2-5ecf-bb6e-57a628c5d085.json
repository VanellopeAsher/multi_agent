You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

The steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n\n- Find the total number of letters in the alphabet.\n- Calculate the amount of letters Elise has written initially - that is, the alphabet written in full three times and then half of it once.\n- The last step in the problem is that Elise re-writes everything she has already written, so she repeats the letter count from the previous step.\n\nThe key idea here is that we count the number of times the complete alphabet is written, carry out the multiplication and finally add up everything.\n\nWe can solve this directly using Python:\n\n```python\n# Defining the number of letters in the alphabet\nalphabet_length = 26\n\n# Calculating the total letters written initially\nletters_written_initially = (alphabet_length * 3) + (alphabet_length * 0.5)\n\n# As per the problem, Elise re-writes everything she has written initially\ntotal_letters_written = letters_written_initially * 2\n\nprint(total_letters_written)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the total number of letters Elise has written."
