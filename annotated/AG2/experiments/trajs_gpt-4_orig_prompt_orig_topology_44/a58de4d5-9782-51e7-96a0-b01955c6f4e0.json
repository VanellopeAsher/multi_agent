  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Each of them can be calculated as the price per pound of the ingredient times the amount of the ingredient used in one jar. The cost of secret ingredient (water) is $0, so it does not contribute to the cost.\n\nNext, subtract the cost of ingredients for one jar from the selling price of one jar to get the profit from selling one jar. \n\nLastly, multiply the profit from one jar by the number of jars sold to find the total profit.\n\nLet's use Python to do these calculations."
