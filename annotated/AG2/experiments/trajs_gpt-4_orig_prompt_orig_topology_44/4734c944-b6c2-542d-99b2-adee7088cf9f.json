You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

So for Sunday to Wednesday (4 days), he spends every day $10 on wooden action figures that cost $5, and for the rest of the week (3 days), he spends $10 every day on plastic action figures that cost $2.5. We can calculate the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week by calculating separately how many wooden and plastic action figures he can buy and then adding these two numbers together.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Peter spends $10 each day for the whole week \nmoney_per_day = 10\n\n# cost of each wooden action figure\nwooden_figure_cost = 5\n\n# cost of each plastic action figure\nplastic_figure_cost = 2.5\n\n# number of days he buys wooden action figures\nwooden_figure_days = 4\n\n# number of days he buys plastic action figures\nplastic_figure_days = 3\n\n# calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he can buy\nnum_wooden_figures = wooden_figure_days * (money_per_day / wooden_figure_cost)\nnum_plastic_figures = plastic_figure_days * (money_per_day / plastic_figure_cost)\n\n# calculate the total number of figures\ntotal_figures = sp.simplify(num_wooden_figures + num_plastic_figures)\n\nprint(total_figures)\n```\n\nThe exact total number of figures should be obtained from running the above Python script."
