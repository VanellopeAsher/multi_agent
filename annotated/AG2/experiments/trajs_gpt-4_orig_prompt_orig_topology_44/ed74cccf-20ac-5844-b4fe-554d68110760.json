You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Since the problem tells us that twice the number of students playing tennis are playing volleyball, we have 2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball.\n\nWe also know that there are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. Therefore, the problem implies every student in the soccer group is either a boy or a girl. \n\nThe total number of students is therefore the sum of the number of students playing each sport.\n\n```python\n# number of students playing tennis\ntennis_students = 6\n\n# number of students playing volleyball\nvolleyball_students = 2 * tennis_students\n\n# number of girls playing soccer\ngirls_playing_soccer = 22\n\n# total number of students = tennis_students + volleyball_students + number of girls playing soccer \n# let's calculate that.\n\nfrom sympy import *\ninit_printing(use_unicode=False, wrap_line=False)\n\n# define the variables\ntennis_students, volleyball_students, girls_playing_soccer = symbols('tennis_students volleyball_students girls_playing_soccer')\n\n# total number of students formula\ntotal_students_formula = Eq(tennis_students + volleyball_students + girls_playing_soccer, total_students)\n\n# substitute the known values into the formula\ntotal_students_calculated = total_students_formula.subs({\n    tennis_students: 6,\n    volleyball_students: 12,\n    girls_playing_soccer: 22\n})\n\n# print the total number of students\nprint(total_students_calculated)\n```\n\nFinally, we just need to solve the equation to get the total number of students.
