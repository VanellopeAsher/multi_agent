You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

      "content": "Key idea: The problem provides the relationships between the ages of the siblings. The age of the sisters is given as 1.6 times 10, which indicates that all three sisters have the same age. The age of one brother is given as 3/5 times 20, which is half the age of the other brother. Therefore, we first calculate the ages individually, then add up the ages of all siblings to get the total age.\n\nTo implement this in Python, we will use sympy to perform the calculations. The program will directly solve the problem.\n\nNow, Let's write the Python program.\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the ages of all siblings according to the problem\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10  # All sisters have the same age\nyounger_brother_age = 3 / 5 * 20  # The age of the younger brother\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age  # The age of the older brother is twice the younger brother\n\n# Calculate the total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = 3 * sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\nprint(total_age)\n```"
