You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

      "content": "Key idea to solve the problem:\nThis problem is a type of algebraic word problem involving system of linear equations. The key idea to solve this problem is to express the given conditions in the problem with two variables. We know that each small stuffed animal costs $40. So, we can assume the price for large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of the small ones. We also know she earned $1200 today by selling twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. These conditions are enough to set up two linear equations, which will be solved to get the quantity of small stuffed animals she sold.\n\nCase 1: Solving this problem using Python code\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# s represent number of small stuffed animals\n# l represent number of large stuffed animals\n\ns, l = symbols('s l')\n\n# The price of a small stuffed animal is $40\n# The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of small one, so it's $120\n# Teresa earned $1200 today by selling the stuffed animals\neq1 = Eq(40*s + 120*l, 1200)\n\n# The number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large ones sold\neq2 = Eq(s, 2*l)\n\n# Solve these simultaneous equations\nsold_stuffed_animals = solve((eq1,eq2), (s, l))\n\n# Print the number of small stuffed animals she sold\nprint('The number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is', sold_stuffed_animals[s])\n```\nSimply run this code to get the answer for the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold."
