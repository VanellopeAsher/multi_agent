You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "Key idea: The painting speed of one individual is half of a house per 5 days. The painting speed of 5 individuals is simply the speed of one individual multiplied by 5. We can find out how long it takes for the team to paint the whole house by dividing the total work by the team's speed.\n\nBased on the problem description, one individual can paint half of a house in 5 days (120 hours), which means one individual can paint a whole house in twice the time - 240 hours.\n\nThe problem is asking how long it would take a team of 5 individuals to paint the entire house. This means the painting speed is 5 times that of one individual.\n\nThis problem can be solved directly using Python code. We will divide the total work (which is 1 whole house) with the team's speed.\n\nLet's demonstrate this with Python code:\n\n```python\n# Python code\none_person_speed = 240 # the time one person takes to paint a house in hours\nteam_size = 5 # the number of people in the team\n\nteam_speed = one_person_speed / team_size # the time the team takes to paint a house\n\nprint(\"The team can paint the house in\", team_speed, \"hours.\")\n```"
