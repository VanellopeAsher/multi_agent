  "problem": "Every month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Additionally, Madeline also buys a special shampoo for her dog that costs $15 per month and a toy that costs $10 every two months. If there are 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year, how much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

Compute the total cost of food per month by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a month.\n2. Compute the total cost of treats and medicine per month.\n3. Compute the total cost of shampoo per month.\n4. Compute the total cost of toys per month, considering that one toy is bought every two months.\n5. Add up all the monthly costs calculated in earlier steps to get the total monthly cost.\n6. Multiply the total monthly cost by the number of months in a year to get the total yearly cost.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# given values\nfood_per_week = 25 # dollars\ntreats_per_month = 20 # dollars\nmedicine_per_month = 100 # dollars\nshampoo_per_month = 15 # dollars\ntoy_per_two_month = 10 # dollars\nweeks_per_month = 4 # weeks\nmonths_per_year = 12 # months\n\n# calculate total monthly cost\nfood_per_month = food_per_week * weeks_per_month\ntoy_per_month = toy_per_two_month / 2\ntotal_monthly_cost = food_per_month + treats_per_month + medicine_per_month + shampoo_per_month + toy_per_month\n\n# calculate total yearly cost\ntotal_yearly_cost = total_monthly_cost * months_per_year\n\nprint(total_yearly_cost)\n```\n\nThis program calculates the total cost that Madeline spends on her dog each year."
