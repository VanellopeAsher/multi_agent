You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80.

      "content": "Key Idea: The cost per class is calculated as the total cost divided by the number of classes attended. We can calculate the number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $20.\n\nBased on the problem description, Manny's total cost for all classes is $80, and the requirement from his parents is that each class Manny attends can't cost more than $20.\n\nTo solve the problem, we can write a program to find out how many classes Manny can miss while still keeping the cost of each class attended below $20. The cost per class attended is calculated as the total cost divided by the number of classes attended. We iterate from 1 class missed to 11 classes missed (as there are 12 classes in total, Manny cannot miss them all), and stop when the cost per class attended first exceeds $20.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# total cost for all classes\ntotal_cost = 80\n\n# total number of classes\ntotal_classes = 12\n\n# cost per class limit\nclass_cost_limit = 20\n\n# number of classes Manny can miss without exceeding the cost per class limit\nmissed_classes = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, total_classes):\n    # cost per class if Manny misses i classes\n    cost_per_class = sp.Rational(total_cost, (total_classes - i))\n    if cost_per_class > class_cost_limit:\n        missed_classes = i - 1\n        break\n\n# output the result\nprint(missed_classes)\n```\nThe result will be the maximum number of classes Manny can miss and still have his classes cost $20 or less each."
