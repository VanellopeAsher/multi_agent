You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month.

The total cost for one year would be the cost for the first half of the year plus the cost for the second half of the year.\n\nThe cost for the first six months is $200 each month, and the cost for the second six months is 85% of $200 each month (15% less than $200).

Add the two costs together.\n\nWe can represent these steps in the following Python code. \n\n```python\n# Cost per month\ncost_per_month = 200 \n\n# Number of months in a year\nmonths_in_year = 12\n\n# The cost of the first half of the year\nfirst_half_cost = cost_per_month * (months_in_year / 2)\n\n# The cost of the second half of the year is 15% less\nsecond_half_cost = cost_per_month * 0.85 * (months_in_year / 2) \n\n# The total cost for the year\ntotal_cost = first_half_cost + second_half_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```"
