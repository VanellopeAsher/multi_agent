You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old.

According to the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1. P + Q + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)\n2. Q = J + 18  (Paul is 18 years older than John)\n3. P = Q + J (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)\n\nUsing sympy, we will be able to solve this system of equations.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbols\nP, Q, J = symbols('P Q J')\n\n# define the equations\neq1 = Eq(P + Q + J, 100)\neq2 = Eq(Q, J + 18)\neq3 = Eq(P, Q + J)\n\n# solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1,eq2,eq3), (P, Q, J))\n\n# print the solution\nprint(f\"Peter's age is {solution[P]} years old.\")\n```\nThe output will be the age of Peter."
