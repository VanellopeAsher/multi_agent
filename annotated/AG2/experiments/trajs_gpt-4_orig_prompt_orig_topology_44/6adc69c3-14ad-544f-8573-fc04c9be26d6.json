You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThe key idea to solve this problem is to reason backwards from the information given. The problem describes that each final cut is 5 cm. Each of these final parts is a result of dividing each cut part into 5 equal parts. Each cut part is a result of dividing the whole ribbon into 4 equal parts.\n\nSo every cut part equals to 5 (cm)* 5, and the whole ribbon equals to 4* cut part.\n\nPython code is suited for this problem because it can perform these calculations swiftly.\n\nCase 1: We can solve this using Python code directly. \n\n1. Multiply 5 by 5 to get the length of each cut part.\n2. Multiply this result by 4 to get the total length of the ribbon.\n\nWe can represent these steps in the following Python code: \n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate length of ribbon\ncut_part = 5 * 5  # each cut part is 5 cm * 5\nribbon = cut_part * 4 # the whole ribbon is 4*cut part\nprint(ribbon)\n```\n\nThis will output the length of the ribbon in cm. You may input this Python script into your Python environment to obtain the result."
