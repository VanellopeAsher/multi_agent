  "problem": "At the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces. The teacher agreed. Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she sold all her muffin crayons and made $36, how much each muffin crayon sells for?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this is to first figure out how many muffin crayons Kate made and then to divide the total money she made by the number of muffin crayons.\n\nFirstly, we need to figure out how many crayons in total Kate has, which is 3 boxes of 64 crayons. Then, as she would melt 8 small pieces of crayons to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total crayons by 8 to get the number of muffin crayons. Finally, we divide the total money she made by the number of muffin crayons she made to figure out how much each muffin crayon sells for.\n\nWe can solve this problem using Python directly:\n\n```python\n# calculate the total number of crayons by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64 \n\n# calculate the number of muffin crayons by dividing total crayons by the number of crayons needed for each muffin crayon\ntotal_muffin_crayons = total_crayons // 8 \n\n# calculate the cost of each muffin crayon by dividing the total money made by the total number of muffin crayons\ncost_per_muffin_crayon = 36 / total_muffin_crayons \n\n# print the output\nprint(cost_per_muffin_crayon)\n```\n\nThe output will be the cost of each crayon muffin, which we can write as \\boxed{} once we know the value."
