You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to understand that the mean or average of a set of numbers is calculated by adding all numbers in the set and then dividing by the count of numbers in the set. From the problem, we know that the mean score is 70 and the count of quizzes is 9 (including the forgotten one). We can set up the equation to solve for the forgotten score.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can solve this problem by writing a Python program.\n\nCase 1: The problem can be solved with Python code directly. I'll write a program to solve it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# recorded scores\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# mean score\nmean_score = 70\n\n# total quizzes including the forgotten one\ntotal_quizzes = 9\n\n# defining a symbol for the forgotten score\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# equation setup\nequation = Eq(sum(scores) + x, mean_score * total_quizzes)\n\n# solving the equation for x\nforgotten_score = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# print the result\nprint(forgotten_score)\n```\n\nThis program first defines the symbol 'x' to represent the forgotten score, then sets up an equation based on the formula for the mean. The 'solve' function from the sympy package is used to solve this equation for x, yielding the forgotten score."
