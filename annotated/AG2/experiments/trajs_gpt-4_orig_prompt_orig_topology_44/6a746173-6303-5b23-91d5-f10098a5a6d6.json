You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

So we first need to calculate the total amount donated by others, which includes the money collected from neighbors, the money collected from the online fund, and the money given by the friend. Then we multiply this total by 3 to get the amount the lawyer will contribute.\n\nIn Python, this can be calculated directly. Here is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\n# values provided in problem\nneighbors_donation = 300\nonline_fund_donation = 1200\nfriend_donation = 120\n\n# total donation from others \ntotal_donation_others = neighbors_donation + online_fund_donation + friend_donation\n\n# lawyer donation which is three times the total donation from others\nlawyer_donation = 3 * total_donation_others\n\n# print the lawyer's donation\nprint(lawyer_donation)\n```\n"
