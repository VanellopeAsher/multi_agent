You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead?\"\n\nTo maximize earnings, he should be working all the time. However, realistically, an individualday is 24 hours, and a week is 7 days. So, if we disregard sleep and other activity and consider him working every hour of the week, we can calculate the maximum money he could earn. Let's calculate assuming he's working all 24 hours for a week.\n\n```python\nhours_per_day = 24\ndays_per_week = 7\nhourly_wage = 10\n\ntotal_hours = hours_per_day * days_per_week\ntotal_earnings = total_hours * hourly_wage\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nThis is under the hypothetical scenario where Jordan works every hour of the day consecutively for a week, which is humanly unfeasible and unhealthy.
