You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "Key Idea: First, we figure out how many rows of each color tulip Jackson can plant. Then, based on these numbers, we find out how many rows of yellow tulips Jackson will need. Ultimately, we add all the rows together to get the total number of rows.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Calculate the number of rows of red and blue tulips that Jackson would plant by dividing the total red tulips and blue tulips by the number of tulips that can be planted in a row.\n2. There will be a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips. So, calculate the number of yellow tulips rows.\n3. Add all the rows together to get the total number of rows.\n\nImplementation in Python:\n```python\n# import sympy library for symbolic computation\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# calculate number of rows for each color\nred_rows = 36 / 6\nblue_rows = 24 / 8\nyellow_rows = (red_rows + blue_rows) - 1  # there will be one row of yellow flowers less because they are planted between the red and blue rows\n\n# calculate total number of rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\n# output the total number of rows\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you will get the total number of rows of flowers that Jackson will plant."
