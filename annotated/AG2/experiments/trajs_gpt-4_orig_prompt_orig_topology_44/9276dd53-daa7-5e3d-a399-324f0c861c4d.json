You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there.

      "content": "The key to this problem is understanding the relationships between the quantities. According to the problem, the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. \n\nTo solve this, we can set up a simple equation for each relationship and solve for each quantity. So, we'll do:\n1. Find the number of robots (which is half the number of helmets).\n2. Find the number of footballs (which is twice the number of helmets).\n3. Add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs to get the total number of items. \n\nHere's the Python code that will perform these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# Number of robots (half the number of helmets)\nrobots = helmets / 2\n\n# Number of footballs (twice the number of helmets)\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\n# Total number of items\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\n\nprint(total_items)\n```\nGiven the above steps, we can run this Python code to find the total number of items that Dominick saw."
