You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThe key idea to solve this problem is simple multiplication and addition. The problem states that the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is 1/3 of the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson. Therefore, we need to calculate 1/3 of 84 and then add that to the total number of messages delivered to both teachers.\n\nSolution using Python:\nWe can directly solve this problem using Python. We first calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu, and then add that to the number delivered to Ms. Thompson to get the total number of messages. The Python code is given below.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson\nthompson_messages = 84\n\n# calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu\nyu_messages = Rational(1, 3) * thompson_messages\n\n# calculate the total number of messages delivered\ntotal_messages = thompson_messages + yu_messages\n\n# print the total number of messages\nprint(total_messages)\n```\n\nThis code first assigns the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson into a variable. Then it calculates the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu by using 1/3 of the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson. The total number of messages is then computed by adding the number of messages delivered to both teachers. The total number of messages is then printed out."
