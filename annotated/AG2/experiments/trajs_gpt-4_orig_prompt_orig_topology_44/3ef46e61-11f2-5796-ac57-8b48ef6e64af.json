You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

Each day (except Friday) Tim spends 6 hours answering calls. So, over the course of four days (Monday to Thursday), he would work 6 * 4 = 24 hours.\n\n2. But on Fridays, he works an extra two hours, which means he works 6 + 2 = 8 hours on Fridays.\n\n3. To get the total work hours for the whole week, we should sum up the hours from Monday to Thursday with the hours on Friday.\n\n4. We know that it takes 15 minutes (which is 15/60 = 0.25 hours) for him to handle a single call.\n\n5. To find out the total number of calls he can handle, we should divide the total working hours by the time he spends on a single call.\n\nLet's solve this step by step with Python."
