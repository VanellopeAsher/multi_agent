You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\n48 people are riding a bus.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThe key idea to solve this problem is basically addition and subtraction operations. Initially, there are 48 people in the bus. On the first stop, 8 people get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. This is a multiplication operation, we multiply 8 by 5 which gives us the number of passengers who got into the bus. However, before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. Then, on the second stop 21, passengers get off, and 3 times fewer passengers got into the bus than got off. This multiplication operation gives us the number of passengers who got into the bus at the second stop. Subtracting the total people who got off from the total people who got in, we get the final number of passengers in the bus after the second stop.\n\nThis problem can be solved with Python code directly (Case 1):\n\n```python\ninitial_passengers = 48\nfirst_stop_get_off = 8\nfirst_stop_get_on = 5*first_stop_get_off - 2\n\nsecond_stop_get_off = 21\nsecond_stop_get_on = second_stop_get_off // 3\n\ntotal_passengers = initial_passengers - first_stop_get_off + first_stop_get_on - second_stop_get_off + second_stop_get_on\nprint(total_passengers)\n```\nSimply execute this code to get the answer for the total number of passengers after the second stop. The Python floor division operator, `//`, is used to get an integer result of the division."
