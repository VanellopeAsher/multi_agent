You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.

      "content": "The problem can be solved directly with Python code. The key idea is to find out how many balloons they had at first and then subtract the remaining balloons from it.\n\nAssuming Jolene and her friends have filled up `n` packs, they had initially `n * 30` balloons. If `r` is the total number of remaining balloons, the total number of balloons they threw is `n * 30 - r`.\n\nThe problem doesn't give the value of `n`, so we can't get a specific numerical answer. But we can express the answer in terms of `n`.\n\nLet's write the Python code. \n\n```python\ndef calculation(n, r=12):\n    total_balloons = n * 30\n    thrown_balloons = total_balloons - r\n    print(f\"The number of balloons they threw is {thrown_balloons}.\")\n\ncalculation(n)  # You need to replace `n` with an actual number to get a numerical result.\n```\n\nGiven the above function, you can substitute any number for `n` to find out how many balloons were thrown for that many packs. \n\nFor example,\nIf they filled up 5 packs, the answer would be `calculation(5)`. \nIf they filled up 10 packs, the answer would be `calculation(10)`. \n\nSo, without information regarding the number of packs filled up, the answer is \\boxed{30n - 12}."
