Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

After finding the minimum payment, we can then add 50% more to this amount to find out how much she actually ends up paying each month. This payment is then multiplied by 12 to find the cost in a year.\n\nNow, Let's work through it step by step. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total minimum payment for all her debts.\nStep 2: Calculate how much 50% more of the minimum payment is.\nStep 3: Add the increase from step 2 to the minimum payment from step 1. This will give us how much Jessica pays each month.\nStep 4: Multiply by 12 to find out how much Jessica pays in a year.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations in python."
