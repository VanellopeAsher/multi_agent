You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKatherine has 50 hanging baskets to fill.

Calculate the cost for petunias and sweet potato vines for one basket.\n2. Multiply the cost for one basket by the number of baskets to get the total cost.\n\nWe can directly write a program to solve it.\n\nCase 1: Use Python to carry out the computation. \n\n```python\n# define the cost of individual plants\ncost_per_petunia = 3\ncost_per_vine = 2.5\n\n# define the number of plants per basket\npetunias_per_basket = 30\nvines_per_basket = 20\n\n# calculate the cost per basket\ncost_per_basket = cost_per_petunia * petunias_per_basket + cost_per_vine * vines_per_basket \n\n# define the total number of baskets \ntotal_baskets = 50\n\n# compute the total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_per_basket * total_baskets \n\n# print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n\n```"
