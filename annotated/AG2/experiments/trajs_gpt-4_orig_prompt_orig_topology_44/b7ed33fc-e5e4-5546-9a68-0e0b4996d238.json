You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

      "content": "John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. \n\nThe normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes which is the same as half an hour. Hence, he drinks one bottle of water while solving a normal sudoku puzzle.\n\nAn extreme sudoku takes 3 times longer than the normal one, so it takes 3*30 = 90 minutes.\n\nIn every 30 minutes (or half an hour), he drinks a bottle of water. Hence, in 90 minutes, he should drink 90/30 = 3 bottles of water.\n\nSo, let's write a Python code to carry out these computations and verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the time it takes John to finish a normal sudoku puzzle\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30  # minutes\n\n# Define the number of bottles John drinks during a normal sudoku puzzle\nbottles_per_normal_sudoku = normal_sudoku_time / 30 \n\n# An extreme sudoku takes 3 times longer than a normal one\nextreme_sudoku_time = 3 * normal_sudoku_time \n\n# Calculate the number of bottles John drinks during an extreme sudoku puzzle\nbottles_per_extreme_sudoku = extreme_sudoku_time / 30 \n\n# Print the result\nprint(int(bottles_per_extreme_sudoku))\n```\nThis code will give us the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle."
