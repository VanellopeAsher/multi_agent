You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.

We then convert that total to dozens by dividing by 12.\n\nWe can solve the problem with Python code directly:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the number of eggs in a dozen, days in a week, and weeks\neggs_in_a_dozen = 12\ndays_in_a_week = 7\nweeks = 12\n\n# Calculate the total number of eggs Claire consumes\ntotal_eggs = 3 * days_in_a_week * weeks\n\n# Convert the total number of eggs to dozens\ndozens_of_eggs = sp.Rational(total_eggs, eggs_in_a_dozen)\n\nprint(dozens_of_eggs)\n```\n\nThe \\boxed{number} represents the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks."
