For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Calculate Stephen's initial debt, which is $300.\n2. For each of the first 11 months, remove $25 from the debt and add 2% interest to the new debt.\n3. On the 12th month, add 2% interest again, and that's the amount Stephen needs to pay back.\n\nLet's now write the Python code to calculate the exact amount for the 12th month using the sympy package to keep everything in fractions:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, N\n\n# initial debt\ndebt = 300\n\n# for the first 11 months, pay $25 per month and add 2% interest\nfor month in range(11):\n    debt = debt - 25\n    debt = debt * Rational(102, 100)\n\n# on the 12th month, pay back the remaining amount after adding 2% interest\ndebt = debt * Rational(102, 100)\n\n# print the result\nprint(debt)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you will get the 12th month payment amount that Stephen needs to make to his sister, ignoring his coin purchases.
