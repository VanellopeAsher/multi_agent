  "problem": "A math teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk to write equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher is environmentally conscious and tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. However, on Monday, the teacher had to conduct an extra class for his students who needed additional help. As a result, he ended up using 45% of the chalk, which was 1.5 times more than his usual consumption. He also noticed that the chalk weighed 0.5 ounces, but this didn't affect his usage. Given that the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches and he plans to return to his usual 20% usage per day, how many days does he have before he needs to recycle this piece of chalk?",

Since he used 45% of the chalk, we multiply the total length of the chalk (5 inches) by 0.45 to get the length of the chalk used.\n\nThen, we calculate how much chalk is left after Monday's class by subtracting the used chalk from the total length.\n\nFinally, we calculate how many days the remaining chalk will last by dividing the remaining length of chalk by the daily usage (20% of 5 inches), and rounding down to the nearest whole number since the teacher cannot use a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches.\n\nLet's apply this approach in Python."
