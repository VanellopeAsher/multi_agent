You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarly wants to treat her friends.

We then need to add these totals together to get the total cost. After we have the total cost, we can subtract this from the fifty-dollar bill Carly gives to find out how much change she gets back.\n\n```python\n# The number and cost of each item\nnum_burgers = 5\ncost_burger = 4\nnum_fries = 10\ncost_fries = 0.30\nnum_drinks = 5\ncost_drink = 0\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the burgers, fries and drinks\ntotal_burger = num_burgers * cost_burger\ntotal_fries = num_fries * cost_fries\ntotal_drinks = num_drinks * cost_drink\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = total_burger + total_fries + total_drinks\n\n# Calculate the change Carly gets back\nchange = 50 - total_cost\n\n# Output the change\nprint(change)\n```\n\nSince we don't know the price of the cans of fruit drink, I've set cost_drink to 0 in the initial code. In reality, we should replace cost_drink with the correct price of a can of fruit drink when running the code."
