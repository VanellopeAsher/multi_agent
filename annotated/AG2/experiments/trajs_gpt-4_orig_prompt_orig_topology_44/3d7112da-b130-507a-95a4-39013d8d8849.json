You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We know the time he spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows. We also know that the time he spent watching shows is 30% of the total time and the time he spent sightseeing is 40% of the total time. To find how much time he spent sightseeing, we can thus solve the problem as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total time he spent watching shows by multiplying the number of shows with the duration of each show.\n2. Add the time he spent boating and the time he spent swimming to the total time watching shows to get the total time he spent on vacation.\n3. Find 30% of the total time and subtract it from the total time to get how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\nTo solve this, we will be following the third way of solving the problem as outlined in the query requirements.\n\nHere are the Python queries we'll need to run:\n\n1. Total time John spent watching shows.\n2. Total time John spent.\n3. How much time John spent sightseeing."
