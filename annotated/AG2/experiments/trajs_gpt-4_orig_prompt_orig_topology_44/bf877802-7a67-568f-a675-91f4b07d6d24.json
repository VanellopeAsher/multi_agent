You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "Key idea: To solve the problem is to sum the starting angle of the pyramid from the ground, the angle the sun moved in the first 10 hours, and the angle the sun moved in the last 2 hours.\n\nFirstly, the initial degrees from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is given as 32 degrees. \n\nFor the first 10 hours, the degrees that the sun moves straight upward per hour is 5 degrees. Therefore, in 10 hours the sun will have moved = 10 * 5 degrees.\n\nAfter 10 hours, the sun begins moving at a rate of 3 degrees per hour. In the next 2 hours, the amount the sun moves = 2 * 3 degrees.\n\nSo the total degrees from the ground to sun can be calculated by summing above three parts.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate the total degrees:\n\n```python\ninitial_degrees = 32\nfirst_sun_move = 10 * 5\nsecond_sun_move = 2 * 3\n\ntotal_degrees = initial_degrees + first_sun_move + second_sun_move\nprint(total_degrees)\n```"
