You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to understand that the cumulative time John spends boating, swimming and watching shows accounts for 30% of his total time. Therefore, we can set up an equation that reflects this relationship and solve for the unknown variable, representing his total time. The difference between his total time and the time spent on the previously mentioned activities will give us the sightseeing time.\n\nWe can use Python to solve this problem directly.\n\nFirstly, let's calculate the total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows. The given in the problem are: he spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, and also watched three different shows which were 2 hours each.\n\nThen, we know that this total time was 30% of the total time he spent. So, we can set up the equation: \n\ntime_boating + time_swimming + time_shows = 0.3 * total_time\n\nWe can solve this equation to find out the total time.\n\nFinally, the time he spent sightseeing is the difference between the total time and the time he spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Time spent on each activity\ntime_boating = 6\ntime_swimming = 0.5 * time_boating\ntime_shows = 3 * 2\n\n# Cumulative time spent on these activities\ntime_spent = time_boating + time_swimming + time_shows\n\n# Define the total time as a symbol\ntotal_time = sp.symbols('total_time')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = sp.Eq(time_spent, 0.3 * total_time)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_time_val = sp.solve(equation, total_time)[0]\n\n# Time spent sightseeing\ntime_sightseeing = total_time_val - time_spent\n\n# Print the result\nprint('John spent {} hours sightseeing.'.format(time_sightseeing))\n```\n\nThe result will be the time John spent sightseeing."
