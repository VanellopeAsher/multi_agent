You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

Emil is 21 now, and will be 26 in five years.\n2. When Emil is 26, he will be half as old as his dad. So, his dad will be 2*26 = 52 years old. Therefore, his dad is currently 52 - 5 = 47 years old.\n3. When Emil is 26, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, his brother will be 26/2 = 13 years old in five years. So, his brother is currently 13 - 5 = 8 years old.\n\nFinally, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. \n\nLet's create a Python script using the sympy package to solve these equations."
