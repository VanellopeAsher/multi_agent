You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

In the third week, it grew some more and the total height was 10 inches. \n\nWe need to find out how much it grew in the third week. We can do this by subtracting the height at the end of the second week from the total height at the end of the third week.\n\n```python\n# calculate height growth in the third week\nheight_second_week = 3 * 2\ntotal_height_third_week = 10\ngrowth_third_week = total_height_third_week - height_second_week\nprint(growth_third_week)\n```\n\nJust run this code and you will get the answer.\n"
