Once we have the total time, we can use the fact that he spent 40% of this time sightseeing to find the answer.\n\n1. **Calculate the time for each activity:**\n\n   - Boating: 6 hours.\n   - Swimming: He spent half of the boating time swimming, so \\(6 \\text{ hours}/2 = 3 \\text{ hours}\\).\n   - Watching shows: He watched 3 shows and each was 2 hours, so \\(3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n2. **Sum the times of the activities to find the total activities time:**\n\n   - Total time spent on activities = Time boating + Time swimming + Time watching shows\n   - Total time spent on activities = \\(6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\text{ hours}\\)\n  \n   According to the problem statement, this total of 15 hours represents 30% of the total time spent, including sightseeing.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time including sightseeing:**\n\n   Since 15 hours accounts for 30% of the total time spent, we can use the following formula to find the total time, \\( X \\):\n\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times X = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{15}{0.30}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   X = 50 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n\n   Since sightseeing accounted for 40% of the total time:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \\times X = 0.40 \\times 50 = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nSo, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
