Walter collects $1500 from an online fund.\n3. Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times the amount of money that everyone else donates.\n4. Walter's friend also makes a donation, although we initially don't know how much.\n\nThe lawyer donated $6600 in total, and according to the problem, this is three times the amount of the total donations from others (neighbors, online fund, and Walter's friend). Let's denote the donation from Walter's friend as \\( F \\).\n\nThe total donation from everyone except the lawyer is:\n\\[\n500 \\text{ (from neighbors)} + 1500 \\text{ (from online fund)} + F \\text{ (from the friend)}\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the lawyer donates three times this total:\n\\[\n6600 = 3 \\times (500 + 1500 + F)\n\\]\n\nWe can now set up the equation and solve for \\( F \\):\n\\[\n6600 = 3 \\times (2000 + F)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\n2200 = 2000 + F\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2000 from both sides to solve for \\( F \\):\n\\[\nF = 2200 - 2000\n\\]\n\\[\nF = 200\n\\]\n\nThus, Walter's friend gave him $200. \n\nIn summary, Walter's friend contributed $200 to the charity."
