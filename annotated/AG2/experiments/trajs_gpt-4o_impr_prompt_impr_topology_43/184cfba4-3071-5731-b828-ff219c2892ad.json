So, the total revenue from small stuffed animals is \\( 2x \\times 40 = 80x \\).\n   - The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one. Therefore, it costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\). So, the total revenue from large stuffed animals is \\( x \\times 120 = 120x \\).\n\n3. **Total Revenue**:\n   - The total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is $1200. Therefore, the equation is:\n     \\[\n     80x + 120x = 1200\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Combined terms: \\( 200x = 1200 \\)\n   - Divide both sides by 200 to find \\( x \\): \n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the Number of Small Stuffed Animals Sold**:\n   - Since \\( x = 6 \\), Teresa sold \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) small stuffed animals.\n\nTherefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."
