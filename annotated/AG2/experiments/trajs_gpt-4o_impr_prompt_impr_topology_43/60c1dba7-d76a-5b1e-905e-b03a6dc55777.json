Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the number of cards Becca has.\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the number of cards Smendrick has.\n   - Let \\( P \\) represent the number of cards PJ has.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equations**:\n   - We know from the problem statement that the total number of cards is 447:\n     \\[\n     B + S + P = 447\n     \\]\n   - Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick:\n     \\[\n     B = S + 15\n     \\]\n   - Smendrick has 4 times the number of cards PJ has:\n     \\[\n     S = 4P\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the Relationships**:\n   - Using the equation \\( B = S + 15 \\) in the total cards equation, we substitute:\n     \\[\n     (S + 15) + S + P = 447\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( S = 4P \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     (4P + 15) + 4P + P = 447\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify and Solve for \\( P \\)**:\n   - Combine the terms:\n     \\[\n     9P + 15 = 447\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 15 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     9P = 432\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 9:\n     \\[\n     P = 48\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find \\( S \\) and \\( B \\)**:\n   - Now that we know \\( P \\), calculate \\( S \\):\n     \\[\n     S = 4P = 4 \\times 48 = 192\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( B \\):\n     \\[\n     B = S + 15 = 192 + 15 = 207\n     \\]\n\nThus, Becca has 207 Magic Cards. \n\nLet me know if there are any other thoughts or if further verification is needed!"
