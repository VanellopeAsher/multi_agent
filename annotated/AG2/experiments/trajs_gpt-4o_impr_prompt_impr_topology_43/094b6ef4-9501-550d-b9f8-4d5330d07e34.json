According to the problem, the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) is 10% of the shark's body length.\n\n   The equation is:\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times L = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - Divide both sides by 0.10 to solve for \\( L \\).\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{12}{0.10} = 120\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The length of the shark is 120 inches.\n\nTherefore, we have determined that the shark is 120 inches long, given the conditions in the problem."

This gives us a combined remora length of 12 inches. \n   - This 12-inch length is stated to be 10% of the shark's length.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - Given that 12 inches is 10% of the shark's length, we can express this relationship mathematically:\n     \\[\n     0.10 \\times \\text{Shark Length} = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving for the Shark's Length**:\n   - The equation \\( 0.10 \\times L = 12 \\) is correctly solved by dividing both sides by 0.10, resulting in the shark's length \\( L = \\frac{12}{0.10} = 120 \\).\n\n4. **Consistent Results**:\n   - The result calculated manually by Agent Problem Solver and verified programmatically by Agent Code Executor both confirm the shark's length as 120 inches.\n\nAs all parts align with the initial problem statement, I can confidently state the final solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{120}**"
