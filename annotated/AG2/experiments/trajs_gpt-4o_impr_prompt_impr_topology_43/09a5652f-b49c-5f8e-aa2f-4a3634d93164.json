To further analyze the problem, I will calculate John's running speed by setting up and solving a simple equation using Python. By considering his running schedule and distances covered each day, we can confirm the computations precisely. Now, I will write the Python code to calculate this.\n\n```python\n# John's weekly stats\ntotal_miles_per_week = 60\nrunning_days_per_week = 3\n\n# Run time for each day based on the problem\nfirst_day_hours = 3\nsecond_third_day_hours = 1.5\n\n# Total running time in hours for the week\ntotal_running_hours = first_day_hours + 2 * second_third_day_hours\n\n# Average speed calculation\naverage_speed = total_miles_per_week / total_running_hours\nprint(average_speed)\n```\n\nI will execute this code to determine John's average running speed. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
