We can represent this as \\(\\frac{1}{3}x\\).\n- We are told that 30 students do not have desktop computers.\n\nWe can now set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}x = 30\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 30 \\times 3 = 90\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 90 students at that grade level."
