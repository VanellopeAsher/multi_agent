He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll break it down step by step using the information given:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Clients**: \n    - Kim currently has 3 clients and expects 5 more, so he plans for a total of \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) clients.\n\n2. **Calculate the Bleach Expenses**:\n    - Each home requires 2 bottles of bleach, costing $2 each.\n    - For 8 clients, Kim needs \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) bottles of bleach.\n    - The bleach cost is \\(16 \\times 2 = $32\\).\n\n3. **Understand the Profit Equation**:\n    - The profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.\n    - Here, it is given that the profit is $20, and the total income is $92.\n    - Let \\(E\\) be the total expenses, then:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Profit} = \\text{Total Income} - \\text{Total Expenses} \\Rightarrow 20 = 92 - E \n      \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Expenses**:\n    - Rearranging the above equation, we find:\n      \\[\n      E = 92 - 20 = 72\n      \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Cloth Packs Cost**:\n    - The total expense \\(E\\) includes the cost of bleach and cloths.\n    - If \\(C\\) is the total cost for the packs of cloths for all clients, then:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Bleach Cost} + \\text{Cloth Packs Cost} = \\text{Total Expenses} \\Rightarrow 32 + C = 72 \n      \\]\n    - Solving for \\(C\\) gives:\n      \\[\n      C = 72 - 32 = 40\n      \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Cost Per Pack of Cloths**:\n    - \\(C\\) represents the total cost for the packs of cloths for 8 clients.\n    - Therefore, the cost per pack of cloths is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n      \\]\n\nThus, the cost of each pack of cloths is $5. Please let me know if there are any details you would like to discuss or further explore with the other agents."

Total number of clients is 8.\n2. Bleach costs for 8 clients is $32.\n3. Total weekly income is $92, and with a profit of $20, total expenses must be $72.\n4. Total cloth cost is the difference between total expenses and bleach cost, i.e., $72 - $32 = $40.\n5. Cost per pack of cloths is $40 divided by 8 clients: $5.\n\nTherefore, the cost of each pack of cloths is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5}**"
