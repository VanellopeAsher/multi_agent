      "content": "To calculate how much Jessica pays on her debts in a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minimum Payments for Each Debt**:\n   - Student Loans: $300/month\n   - Credit Card: $200/month\n   - Mortgage: $500/month\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Minimum Monthly Payment**:\n   Total minimum monthly payment for debts = Student Loans + Credit Card + Mortgage \n   = $300 + $200 + $500 \n   = $1,000\n\n3. **Jessica Wants to Pay 50% More than the Minimum**:\n   We are to calculate 50% more than the total minimum payment.\n   - Additional 50% = 50% of $1,000 = 0.50 * $1,000 = $500\n\n   Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica intends to make is:\n   - Total monthly payments = Total minimum + Additional 50% \n   = $1,000 + $500 \n   = $1,500\n\n4. **Calculate the Annual Payment for Debts**:\n   - Annual payments = Total monthly payments * 12 months \n   = $1,500 * 12 \n   = $18,000\n\nTherefore, Jessica will pay $18,000 on her debts in a year. Note that the Netflix subscription and gym are not included in this calculation as we are focusing on debts only, and the $15 Netflix cost is fully offset by a coupon."

They both correctly calculated the total annual debt payment considering the 50% increase Jessica intends to pay on her minimum debt obligations each month. Here's a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. Jessica's minimum monthly payments are:\n   - Student Loans: $300\n   - Credit Card: $200\n   - Mortgage: $500\n   \n   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000\n\n2. She plans to pay 50% more than the minimum:\n   - 50% of $1,000 is $500\n   - Total monthly payment = $1,000 + $500 = $1,500\n\n3. The annual payment on debts is:\n   - $1,500/month * 12 months = $18,000\n\nJessica will pay $18,000 on her debts for the year. The problem explicitly focuses on debt payments, ignoring the Netflix subscription offset by a coupon. \n\nThus, the confirmed final solution is:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{18000}**"
