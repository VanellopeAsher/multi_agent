Let's assume the length of the entire ribbon is \\( L \\) centimeters.\n\n2. **Further Divide Each Part into 5 Equal Segments**: Each of these 4 parts is then divided into 5 equal segments. This means that by dividing each of the 4 parts into 5 segments, he is ultimately dividing the ribbon into \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) equal segments.\n\n3. **Final Segment Length Requirement**: We know that each final segment must be 5 cm long.\n\nSo, to find how long the entire ribbon must be, we multiply the number of segments by the length of each segment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Length} = \\text{Number of Segments} \\times \\text{Length of Each Segment} = 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marty must have a ribbon that is 100 centimeters long in order to meet all of the cutting requirements. \n\nDiscussion:\nThis explanation lays out the process clearly and concisely. Does this approach make sense to everyone, or is there anything I might have overlooked?"
