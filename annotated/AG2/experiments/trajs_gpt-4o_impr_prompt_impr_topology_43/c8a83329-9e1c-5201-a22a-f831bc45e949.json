Since the number of cards per box is not specified, we need to assume each box contains a certain number of cards. Let \"x\" represent the number of cards per box.\n\n3. **Total Cards Initially**:  \n   - Therefore, the total cards Erica initially has = Cards made by Erica + Cards from Dad\n   - Total = \\(20 + 2x\\)\n\n4. **Cards Passed Out**:  \n   - Passed out to classmates: 24 cards\n   - Passed out to her family: 5 cards\n   - Total passed out = \\(24 + 5 = 29\\) cards\n\n5. **Cards Received**:  \n   - Erica received 17 cards from family and friends.\n\n6. **Calculation of Cards Erica Now Has**:\n   - Cards remaining after passing out = Total initial cards - Cards passed out\n   - Cards remaining = \\(20 + 2x - 29\\)\n   - Total cards Erica now has = Cards remaining + Cards received\n   - Total = \\(20 + 2x - 29 + 17\\)\n   - Simplifying the expression: \\(2x + 8\\)\n\nSince the number of cards per box \"x\" is unknown, the final result is dependent on \"x\". To find the exact number of cards Erica now has, we need to know how many cards were in each box. Once we have that value, we can substitute it into the expression \\(2x + 8\\) to find the exact total."

We will assume each box contains a specific number, say 10 cards, and then calculate how many cards Erica has after giving out and receiving cards. \n\nLet's calculate this using the given information and the assumed number of cards per box.\n\n```python\n# Assumptions\ncards_per_box = 10  # Assumed number of cards per box\n\n# Step 1: Calculate total cards initially\ncards_made = 20\ncards_from_dad = 2 * cards_per_box\n\n# Total initial cards\ntotal_initial_cards = cards_made + cards_from_dad\n\n# Step 2: Calculate cards passed out\ncards_passed_out = 24 + 5  # To classmates and family\n\n# Step 3: Calculate cards received\ncards_received = 17\n\n# Step 4: Compute Erica's remaining cards\ncards_after_passing_out = total_initial_cards - cards_passed_out\ntotal_cards_now = cards_after_passing_out + cards_received\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_cards_now)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

We cannot verify the specific number of cards Erica has without this crucial information. \n\nGiven this lack of information, the problem lacks a definitive solution.
