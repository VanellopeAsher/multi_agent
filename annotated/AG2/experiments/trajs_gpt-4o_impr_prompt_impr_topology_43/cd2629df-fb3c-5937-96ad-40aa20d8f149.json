Here is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Amount Owed with Interest**:\n   - Initial loan amount = $300\n   - Additional 2% interest = $300 * 0.02 = $6\n   - Total owed amount = $300 + $6 = $306\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid in the First 11 Months**:\n   - Monthly payment = $25\n   - Total payment over 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month**:\n   - Remaining balance after 11 months = Total owed amount - Total paid in 11 months\n   - Remaining balance = $306 - $275 = $31\n\nTherefore, in the twelfth month, Stephen will pay his sister $31, excluding any coin purchases."
