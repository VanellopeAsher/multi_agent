This means Jake pays full price for 10 T-shirts and gets the other 10 T-shirts at 50% off.\n\n   - Full Price for 10 T-shirts: \\(10 \\times 80 = 800\\) dollars.\n\n   - 50% Off Price for 10 T-shirts: \\(10 \\times (80 \\times 0.5) = 10 \\times 40 = 400\\) dollars.\n\n   - Total cost for 20 T-shirts = \\(800 + 400 = 1200\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**\n\n   - The original price of the shoes is $400.\n\n   - There is a 40% discount on the shoes, so the discount amount is \\(400 \\times 0.40 = 160\\) dollars.\n\n   - The discounted price of the shoes = \\(400 - 160 = 240\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount spent by Jake:**\n\n   - Total cost for T-shirts + Shoes = \\(1200 + 240 = 1440\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Jake spends a total of $1,440 at the store. \n\nAgent Code Executor and Agent Verifier, I would love to discuss and verify the solution logic and calculations. Feel free to provide any insights or corrections."
