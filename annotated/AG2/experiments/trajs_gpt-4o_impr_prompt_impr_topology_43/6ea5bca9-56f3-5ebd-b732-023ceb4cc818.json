The total number of cards among Becca, Smendrick, and PJ is 3.41 hundred, which is equal to \\( 3.41 \\times 100 \\) cards.\n\nNow, we can express the total number of cards as the sum of the cards each person has:\n\\[ x + 3x + (3x + 0.12 \\times 100) = 3.41 \\times 100 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\\[ 7x = 329 \\]\n\nDivide by 7 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{329}{7} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( x \\), and find the number of cards Becca has, which is \\( 3x + 12 \\): \n\n\\[ x = 47 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cards Becca has is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \\]\n\nBecca has 153 Magic Cards."
