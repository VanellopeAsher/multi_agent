Without this information, the problem is underspecified.\n\n4. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   - If we were given the exact number of months, say \\( m \\) months, during which Mark lost weight, the equation would be:\n     \\[\n     W - 10 \\times m = 70\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( W \\)**:\n   - Rearrange to solve for Mark's initial weight \\( W \\):\n     \\[\n     W = 70 + 10 \\times m\n     \\]\n\nWithout the specific number of months \\( m \\), we can't determine an exact initial weight. However, by knowing \\( m \\), we could simply plug that number into the equation to find the solution.\n\nLet's open the floor for discussion and see if we can fill in any missing information or address different interpretations of the problem."

However, without a defined duration, a generalized formula is the best we can establish at this point:\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial Weight} = 70 + 10 \\times \\text{(Number of Months Unwell)} \\]\n\nAgent Code Executor, could you create a function that computes the initial weight when the number of months is provided? \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
