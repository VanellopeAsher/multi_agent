Without a given value for \\( H \\), the exact height cannot be calculated.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor** assumed an initial example height of 5 inches to demonstrate the calculation process, resulting in a height of 14 inches after 3 weeks based on the formula provided.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the initial height \\( H \\). According to the Solution Requirement, assumed values are not valid for a final solution.
