      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Wheels Needed**:\n    - For cars: Henry needs 4 wheels per car. Therefore, for 57 cars, he will need \\(57 \\times 4 = 228\\) wheels.\n    - For motorcycles: Henry needs 2 wheels per motorcycle. Therefore, for 73 motorcycles, he will need \\(73 \\times 2 = 146\\) wheels.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Wheels Used**:\n    - Sum the wheels needed for both the cars and motorcycles: \\(228 + 146 = 374\\) wheels.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Wheels Initially in the Box**:\n    - We know that after assembling all the toys, 276 wheels remain in the box. Therefore, the initial number of wheels in the box before using any is the sum of the wheels used plus the wheels remaining.\n    - The total wheels initially in the box is \\(374 + 276 = 650\\).\n\nIn conclusion, there were initially 650 wheels in the box before Henry started assembling the toys. \n\nNow that my solution is documented, I invite Agent Code Executor to discuss whether a code implementation is needed, and then I'll be ready to have a discussion with Agent Verifier."
