To find the increased price:\n     - Calculate 80% of $4000: \\( 0.80 \\times 4000 = 3200 \\).\n     - Add this increase to the original price: \\( 4000 + 3200 = 7200 \\).\n   - Therefore, the price in December was $7200.\n\n3. **Price Decrease in January:**\n   - The price decreased by 50% in January. To find the price after this decrease:\n     - Calculate 50% of $7200: \\( 0.50 \\times 7200 = 3600 \\).\n     - Subtract this decrease from the December price: \\( 7200 - 3600 = 3600 \\).\n   - Thus, the final price of the toy after the discount in January was $3600.\n\nIn conclusion, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January was $3600."
