Here, we are given that there are \"2.8 times of ten days\", which implies it is February with 28 days.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Articles Published by the News Website in February:**  \n   - The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day.\n   - Therefore, the total number of articles published by the news website in one month = \\(20 \\text{ articles/day} \\times 28 \\text{ days} = 560 \\text{ articles}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Articles Published by the Sister Company in February:**  \n   - The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day.\n   - Therefore, the total number of articles published by the sister company in one month = \\(10 \\text{ articles/day} \\times 28 \\text{ days} = 280 \\text{ articles}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Articles Published Combined:**  \n   - To find the total, simply add both totals together: \\(560 \\text{ articles} + 280 \\text{ articles} = 840 \\text{ articles}\\).\n\nThus, the two websites together published a total of 840 articles in February."
