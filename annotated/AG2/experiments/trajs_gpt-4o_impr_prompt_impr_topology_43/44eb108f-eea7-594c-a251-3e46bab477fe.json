      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll go through a series of logical steps:\n\n1. **Convert Feet to Inches**: First, we'll convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a 4-foot-long wire is equivalent to:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide the Total Length by the Number of Pieces**: Tracy cut the wire into 8 equal pieces. To find the length of each piece, we divide the total length in inches by the number of pieces:\n   \\[\n   48 \\text{ inches} \\div 8 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Each piece of wire is 6 inches long.\n\nThis solution shows that the wire was evenly distributed into 8 pieces, each measuring 6 inches. With these calculations, Tracy successfully supported her tomato plants using precisely measured pieces of wire."
