Therefore, the number of classes he attends can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the maximum allowable cost per class:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of classes to attend} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of classes}}{\\text{Maximum allowable cost per class}} = \\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\text{ classes}\n\\]\n\nThus, Manny must attend at least 6 classes for the cost per class to not exceed $10. \n\n4. **Determine the number of classes Manny can miss**: Since there are 10 classes in total and he must attend at least 6, the number of classes he can miss is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of classes Manny can miss} = 10 - 6 = 4 \\text{ classes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes before the cost per class exceeds the $10 limit set by his parents."
