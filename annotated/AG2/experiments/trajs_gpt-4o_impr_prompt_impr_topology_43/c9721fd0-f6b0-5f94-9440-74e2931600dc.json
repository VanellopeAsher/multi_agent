Since Patty charges for every fraction of an hour as a full hour, we need to round up 2.25 hours to the nearest full hour.\n   - 2.25 hours rounds up to 3 hours.\n   - The labor cost = 3 hours * $35 per hour = $105.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost of Parts**:\n   - The cost of parts for this job is given as $60.\n   - So, the parts cost = $60.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Bill**:\n   - Total bill = Service fee + Labor cost + Parts cost\n   - Total bill = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205.\n\nThe total amount billed by Patty for the job is $205."
