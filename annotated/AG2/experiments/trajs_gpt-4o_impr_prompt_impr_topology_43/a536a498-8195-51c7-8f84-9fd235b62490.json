      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people Courtney reported were in attendance at the concert. According to the problem, Kelly claimed that Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%. \n\nLet's assume the actual number of people at the concert was \\( x \\). According to Kelly, this number was 40. Courtney overstated this number by 20%, which means she added 20% of the actual number to the actual number itself to get her reported number.\n\nThe expression for Courtney's reported number of attendees, considering an overstatement of 20%, can be written as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Courtney's Reported Number} = x + 0.2x = 1.2x \\]\n\nGiven \\( x = 40 \\) (as per Kelly's report):\n\n\\[ \\text{Courtney's Reported Number} = 1.2 \\times 40 = 48 \\]\n\nTherefore, according to Courtney, 48 people attended the concert. This solution confirms that Courtney originally stated there were 48 people at the concert, which aligns with Kelly's account of an overstatement by 20%."
