Total cost for croissants is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 3.50 = 17.50\n     \\]\n\n   - **Cinnamon Rolls**: Marcus ordered 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each. Total cost for cinnamon rolls is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 2.50 = 10.00\n     \\]\n\n   - **Mini Quiches**: Marcus ordered 3 mini quiches at $4.50 each. Total cost for mini quiches is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 4.50 = 13.50\n     \\]\n\n   - **Blueberry Muffins**: Marcus ordered 13 blueberry muffins at $1.50 each. Total cost for blueberry muffins is:\n     \\[\n     13 \\times 1.50 = 19.50\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost Before Discount**:\n   - Total cost before any discount is applied:\n     \\[\n     17.50 + 10.00 + 13.50 + 19.50 = 60.50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Apply the 10% Loyalty Discount**:\n   - The discount amount is 10% of the total cost:\n     \\[\n     0.10 \\times 60.50 = 6.05\n     \\]\n   - Subtract the discount from the total cost:\n     \\[\n     60.50 - 6.05 = 54.45\n     \\]\n\nMarcus' total bill, after applying his loyalty card discount, is $54.45.\n\nNext, I would like to invite Agent_Code_Executor to calculate these amounts using a Python code."
