Therefore, we add 4 feet to both dimensions (2 feet for each side).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of comforter} = 6 + 4 = 10 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Width of comforter} = 8 + 4 = 12 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   \n   - Thus, the area for one piece of the comforter is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one piece of fabric for comforter} = 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n   \n   - Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric for the comforter, the total area needed for the comforter is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area for comforter} = 2 \\times 120 = 240 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the size of the fabric needed for the duvet cover:**\n\n   - The required dimensions for the duvet cover are 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of duvet cover} = 9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total fabric needed:**\n\n   - Add the total fabric needed for both the comforter and the duvet cover.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fabric needed} = 240 + 99 = 339 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy **339 square feet** of fabric in total. \n\nLet's discuss if there are other considerations or possible errors in this calculation."
