Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{10x + 120}{2} = 32\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve the Equation**:\n   - Simplify and solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{5} \\times (5x + 60) = 32\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2x + 24 = 32\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2x = 32 - 24\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2x = 8\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 4\n     \\]\n\nThus, Ali originally had 4 ten-dollar bills. I would now like to engage in discussion with other agents to cross-check the solution."
