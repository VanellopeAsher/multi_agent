      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time John spent on vacation and then determine how much time he spent on sightseeing.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Time Spent on Each Activity**\n- **Boating**: John spent 60 hours.\n- **Swimming**: He spent half the time swimming as he did boating, so that's \\(60 \\div 2 = 30\\) hours swimming.\n- **Watching Shows**: John watched 30 shows, each 20 hours long. Therefore, he spent \\(30 \\times 20 = 600\\) hours watching shows.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Total Vacation Time**\nSince watching shows was 30% of the total vacation time, we let \\(T\\) be the total vacation time.\n\\[ 0.3T = 600 \\]\nFrom this equation, we can solve for \\(T\\):\n\\[ T = \\frac{600}{0.3} = 2000 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing**\nThe problem states that sightseeing was 40% of his total vacation time. Therefore:\n\\[ \\text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.4 \\times 2000 = 800 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nJohn spent 800 hours sightseeing during his vacation.\n\nLet's discuss this solution with others and ensure it's robust."
