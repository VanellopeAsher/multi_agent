Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each. \n   - Total cost without discount: \\( 15 \\text{ apples} \\times \\$15/\\text{apple} = \\$225 \\).\n\n2. Clara had a $3 discount voucher.\n   - Total cost after discount: \\( \\$225 - \\$3 = \\$222 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost for Sheila\n\n1. The next day, the price of apples increased to $25 each. Sheila also bought 15 apples.\n   - Total cost without discount: \\( 15 \\text{ apples} \\times \\$25/\\text{apple} = \\$375 \\).\n\n2. Sheila received a 15% discount on the total cost.\n   - Discount amount: \\( 15\\% \\times \\$375 = 0.15 \\times \\$375 = \\$56.25 \\).\n   - Total cost after discount: \\( \\$375 - \\$56.25 = \\$318.75 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Difference in Final Prices\n\n- Difference in total cost: \\( \\$318.75 - \\$222 = \\$96.75 \\).\n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is \\( \\$96.75 \\)."
