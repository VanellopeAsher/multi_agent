      "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers on his backyard fence, which forms a rectangle. There's no need to hang streamers on the tree, as specified.\n\n2. **Fence Dimensions**: The fence's dimensions are given as:\n   - Length of the longer side: 20 feet\n   - Length of the shorter side: 15 feet\n  \n3. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Fence**: \n   To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we have to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle formed by the fence. The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Tree Consideration**: The tree, although mentioned, does not obstruct any part of the fence where streamers are to be hung. Therefore, it does not affect the calculation of how much crepe paper is needed for the fence.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the tree does not interfere with the fence and no mention of adjustments needs to be made, the total length of crepe paper James needs is the same as the calculated perimeter of the fence.\n\nHence, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper for his fence.\n\nLet's proceed with discussing this approach with the other agents to ensure consistency and accuracy."
