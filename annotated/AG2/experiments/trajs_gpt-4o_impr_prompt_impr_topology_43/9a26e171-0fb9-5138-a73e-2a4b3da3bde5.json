Thus, the number of students with a desktop computer is \\(\\frac{3}{4}x\\).\n   - 20 students do not have desktop computers.\n\n3. **Use Additional Information**:\n   - The 20 students who do not have desktop computers represent one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop.\n   - Therefore, the total number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop is \\(20 \\times 3 = 60\\).\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   - Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, the remaining one-fourth do not have desktops. This one-fourth equals the 60 students who do not have either device.\n\n   - Therefore, we set up the following equation: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4}x = 60\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve the Equation**:\n   - To find \\( x \\), multiply both sides by 4:\n     \\[\n     x = 60 \\times 4 = 240\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 240 = 180\\) students have desktop computers.\n   - Thus, 60 students do not have desktops or laptops, matching our calculated number.\n\nHence, there are \\( \\boxed{240} \\) students at that grade level."
