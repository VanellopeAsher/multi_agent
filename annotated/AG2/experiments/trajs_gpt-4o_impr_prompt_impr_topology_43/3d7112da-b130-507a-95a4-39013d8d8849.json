Let \\( T \\) be the total vacation time:\n     \\[\n     0.3T = 7.5 \\Rightarrow T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} = 25 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Sightseeing Time:**\n   - If sightseeing was 40% of his vacation time, then:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sightseeing Time} = 0.4 \\times 25 = 10 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John spent 10 hours sightseeing on his vacation."
