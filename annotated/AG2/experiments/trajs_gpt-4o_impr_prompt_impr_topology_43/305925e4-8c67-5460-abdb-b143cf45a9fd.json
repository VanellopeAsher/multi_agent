Joey's total points after his turn will be \\( 214 + X \\).\n   - Marcy scores 10 points during her turn. So, her total points after her turn will be \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Joey's Lead**:\n   - To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract Marcy's total points from Joey's total points after their respective turns:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Joey's lead} = (214 + X) - 235\n   \\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can determine Joey's lead if we know \\( X \\). Thus, Joey's lead in terms of points after both turns is \\( (X - 21) \\). \n\n4. **Conclusion**: \nFor an accurate numerical answer, the specific score Joey achieved in his turn would need to be provided. \nWe can engage in further discussion to clarify or complete the solution once \\( X \\), Joey's exact score, is given. \n\nNow, let's discuss our findings or further steps with the other agents if needed."
