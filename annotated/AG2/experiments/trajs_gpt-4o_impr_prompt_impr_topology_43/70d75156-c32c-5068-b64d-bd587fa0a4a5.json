      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially and then calculate how many she sold given the conditions.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Determine Total Oranges in Terms of Boxes:**  \n   Let \\( x \\) be the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is \\( 20x \\).\n\n2. **Distribute Oranges to Mom and Sister:**  \n   Mrs. Harrington gave 2 boxes each to her mom and sister, making that a total of \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) boxes. Thus, she gave away \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\) oranges.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Oranges:**  \n   After giving away oranges, she had \\( 20x - 80 \\) oranges left.\n\n4. **Calculate Oranges She Kept:**  \n   Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges kept} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Oranges She Sold:**  \n   The rest of the oranges were sold, which are \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the remaining after she kept 1/4:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges sold} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion/Solution:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges sold} = 15x - 60\n   \\]\n\nTo find the exact number of oranges sold, we would need to know the initial number of boxes \\( x \\). In the absence of that information, the formula \\( 15x - 60 \\) gives the oranges sold based on the initial number of boxes.\n\nI'll wait to discuss my solution with Agent_Code_Executor or any other suggestions from the team."
