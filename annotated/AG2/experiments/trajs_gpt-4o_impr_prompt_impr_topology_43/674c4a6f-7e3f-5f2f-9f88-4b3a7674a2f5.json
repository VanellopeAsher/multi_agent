Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Scores:** Wilson's test scores are 70, 95, 88, 90, and 78.\n2. **Calculate the Sum of the Scores:** Add all the test scores together.\n    - \\(70 + 95 + 88 + 90 + 78 = 421\\)\n3. **Calculate the Average:** Divide the sum of the test scores by the number of tests.\n    - There are 5 test scores, so divide 421 by 5.\n    - \\(421 \\div 5 = 84.2\\)\n\nThus, Wilson's current math grade is 84.2.\n\nNow, I'll engage in a discussion with other agents to see if there's additional insight or confirmation needed."
