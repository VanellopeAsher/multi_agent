Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of Known Items**:\n   - The cost of one chicken meal: $120\n   - The cost of 5 packs of milk where each pack costs $30: \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 30 = 150\n     \\]\n   - The cost of 40 apples where each apple costs $1.50:\n     \\[\n     40 \\times 1.50 = 60\n     \\]\n\n2. **Compute Total Cost of Items Except Pizza**:\n   - Add the costs calculated above:\n     \\[\n     120 + 150 + 60 = 330\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Remaining Amount for Pizza**:\n   - Marie paid a total of $900. Therefore, the amount spent on pizzas is:\n     \\[\n     900 - 330 = 570\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Pizza Boxes**:\n   - Each box of pizza costs $57. To find how many boxes she ordered:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{570}{57} = 10\n     \\]\n\nBased on these calculations, Marie ordered **10 boxes of pizza**."
