Without knowing the exact value of \\( R \\), we won't be able to calculate the inches of ribbon per gift. Therefore, if the total ribbon length \\( R \\) is provided, we can proceed with the following calculation:\n   \n3. **Determine the Ribbon per Gift Bow:**\n   To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we would divide the total amount of ribbon \\( R \\) by the total number of gifts.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ribbon per gift} = \\frac{R}{12}\n   \\]\n\nIn summary, without knowing the total ribbon length \\( R \\), we cannot specify the exact ribbon inches per gift bow. But mathematically, it will be \\( R/12 \\), where \\( R \\) is the total length of the ribbon available. If \\( R \\) is provided, we can calculate the precise amount of ribbon per gift bow. \n\nLet's discuss this with Agent_Code_Executor and see if there are any additional steps or calculations needed."
