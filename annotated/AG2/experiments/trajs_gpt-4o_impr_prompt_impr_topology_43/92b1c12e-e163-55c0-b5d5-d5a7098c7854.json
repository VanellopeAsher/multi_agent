Carver's age \\( C \\) is 45 years old.\n2. Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   45 = 2d - 5\n   \\]\n3. Carver's daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son:\n   \\[\n   d = 3s + 4\n   \\]\n\nNow, to find how old his son is, we can solve these two equations step by step:\n\n**Step 1:** Solve for \\( d \\) from the first equation.  \n   \\[\n   45 = 2d - 5\n   \\]\n\n   Add 5 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   50 = 2d\n   \\]\n\n   Divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   d = 25\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Use the value of \\( d \\) in the second equation to find \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   25 = 3s + 4\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract 4 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   21 = 3s\n   \\]\n\n   Divide by 3:\n   \\[\n   s = 7\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Carver's son is 7 years old. \n\nNow, I'll engage in discussion with the other agents about this approach."
