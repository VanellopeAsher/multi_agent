      "content": "To determine how much Jessica will pay towards her debts in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minimum Monthly Payments**:\n   - Student loans: $3000 per month\n   - Credit card: $2000 per month\n   - Mortgage: $5000 per month\n\n2. **Calculate 50% More Than the Minimum for Each Debt**:\n   - For the student loans: $3000 + (50% of $3000) = $3000 + $1500 = $4500\n   - For the credit card: $2000 + (50% of $2000) = $2000 + $1000 = $3000\n   - For the mortgage: $5000 + (50% of $5000) = $5000 + $2500 = $7500\n\n3. **Sum Up the New Monthly Payments**:\n   - Total monthly payment: $4500 (student loans) + $3000 (credit card) + $7500 (mortgage) = $15,000\n\n4. **Calculate the Annual Payment**:\n   - Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual payment is: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000\n\nThus, Jessica will pay $180,000 in a year when paying 50% more than the minimum on all her debts. \n\nLet me know if there is anything else you would like to discuss."
