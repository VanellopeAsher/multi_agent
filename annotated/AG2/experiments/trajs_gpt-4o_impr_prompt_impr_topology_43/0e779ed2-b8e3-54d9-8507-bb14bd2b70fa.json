Therefore, the younger brother is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Younger brother's age} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 = 12 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Age of the Older Brother**:\n   - We know that the younger brother is half the age of the older brother.\n   - Let the older brother's age be \\( x \\). According to the given information:\n     \\[\n     12 = \\frac{x}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     x = 24 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Combined Age of the Brothers**:\n   - Add the ages of both brothers:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total age of brothers} = 12 (\\text{younger brother}) + 24 (\\text{older brother}) = 36 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Compute the Total Age of All Siblings**:\n   - Total age of all siblings is the sum of the ages of the sisters and brothers:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total age of all siblings} = 48 (\\text{sisters}) + 36 (\\text{brothers}) = 84 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the total age of all siblings is \\( 84 \\) years."
