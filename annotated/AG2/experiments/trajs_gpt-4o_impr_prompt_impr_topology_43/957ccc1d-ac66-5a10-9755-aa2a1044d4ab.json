      "content": "To find out the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Weight Loss Required:**  \n   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Calorie Deficit Required:**  \n   Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, he needs a total calorie deficit of:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ lbs} \\times 3500 \\text{ calories/lb} = 105,000 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Frame:**  \n   From December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 and a half months. We'll calculate the exact number of days:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 or 29 days (since the problem doesn't specify a year, we'll assume 28)\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - Up to July 19th: 19 days\n\n   Therefore, the total number of days is:\n   \\[\n   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Required Daily Calorie Deficit:**  \n   Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{105,000 \\text{ calories}}{200 \\text{ days}} = 525 \\text{ calories/day}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to meet his weight loss goal by July 19th."

Andy needs to lose 30 pounds.\n2. It requires a calorie deficit of 3500 per pound to lose weight.\n3. The total calories that need to be burnt are \\(30 \\times 3500 = 105,000\\) calories.\n4. The period from December 31st to July 19th is approximately 200 days.\n5.
