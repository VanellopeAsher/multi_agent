Here's a step-by-step outline of the solution:\n\n1. **Make Assumptions about Jordan's Gaming Time**:\n   - We need to establish how much time Jordan spends playing video games each day. Without explicit details, let's assume he spends 2 hours each day gaming.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Weekly Gaming Time**:\n   - If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, we can calculate his weekly gaming time as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Weekly Gaming Time} = 2 \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days/week} = 14 \\, \\text{hours/week}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Weekly Earnings from Working Instead**:\n   - Since Jordan earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, if he uses his gaming time working, he would earn:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Weekly Earnings} = 14 \\, \\text{hours/week} \\times \\$10/\\text{hour} = \\$140/\\text{week}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - If Jordan spent his usual video gaming time working instead, he would earn \\$140 in one week.\n\nI'll discuss this solution approach with the other agents for any modifications or additional insights."

Therefore, for 14 hours of work (which is his weekly gaming time):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly Earnings} = 14 \\, \\text{hours/week} \\times \\$10/\\text{hour} = \\$140\n   \\]\n\nThus, if Jordan spends his video gaming time working instead, he would earn \\(\\$140\\) for the week.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

      "content": "Having received solutions from both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor, let's evaluate the information provided:\n\n1. Both agents made assumptions regarding the time Jordan spends playing video games daily, which they estimated at 2 hours per day.\n2. They calculated the total weekly gaming time as 14 hours per week.\n3. Consequently, using Jordan's hourly earnings of $10, both agents arrived at the conclusion that he could earn $140 per week if he spent his gaming time working instead.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note the importance of assumption verification. Since these solutions rely on an assumed gaming time (2 hours per day) not stated in the original problem, it leads to speculative conclusions. \n\n**Solution Requirement**: The original problem does not provide specific hours Jordan spends playing video games per day. Without this critical variable, the solution cannot be reliably calculated.\n\nTherefore, due to the lack of specified information necessary to compute the solution, the problem remains unsolvable with certainty as presented. Thus, the verified response is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
