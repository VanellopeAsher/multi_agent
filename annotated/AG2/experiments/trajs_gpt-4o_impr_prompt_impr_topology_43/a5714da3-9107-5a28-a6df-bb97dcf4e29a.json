We are unable to calculate this since the number of fish (20) is mentioned, but the unit price is missing.\n\n5. **Cost of the Fish Food**: Scarlett also bought fish food for $2.00.\n\nNext, we add up all the costs to find the total expenses. However, due to the missing cost of the fish, we can only calculate the known expenses:\n\nTotal known expenses = Cost of the Aquarium + Cost of the Rocks + Cost of the Coral + Cost of the Fish Food  \n\\[ \n10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = 23.00 \n\\]\n\nTherefore, based on the given information (excluding the unknown cost of the fish), Scarlett spent $23.00.\n\nIn order to provide the complete amount spent, we either need the price per fish or another clarification on the pricing for the fish."
