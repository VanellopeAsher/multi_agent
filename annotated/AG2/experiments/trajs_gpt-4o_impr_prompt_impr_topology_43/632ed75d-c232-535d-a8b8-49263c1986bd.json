      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll start by defining the variables and translating the problem details into mathematical expressions.\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the total number of daily flights made by the first aircraft.\n\n2. **Set Up the Relationships**:\n   - According to the problem, the second aircraft makes 44 flights, which is half of the total flights made by the first aircraft. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     x = 88\n     \\]\n   So, the first aircraft makes a total of 88 flights daily.\n\n3. **Break Down Flight Destinations**:\n   - The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its flights. Hence, the number of flights to Greece is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n     \\]\n   - The remaining flights are divided equally between France and Germany. To find the number of remaining flights:\n     \\[\n     88 - 66 = 22\n     \\]\n   - These 22 flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n     \\]\n\nSo, the first aircraft makes 11 flights to France each day."
