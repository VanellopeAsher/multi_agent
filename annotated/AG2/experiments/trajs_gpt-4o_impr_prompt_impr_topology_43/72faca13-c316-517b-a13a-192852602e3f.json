Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 25 = 125 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Kelly's Total Money in Dimes**:  \n   - Kelly has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Kelly's Total Money**:  \n   - Add the total value of the quarters and dimes to find Kelly's total amount of money:\n     \\[\n     125 + 20 = 145 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Cost of Purchases**:  \n   - Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents. The total cost is:\n     \\[\n     55 + 45 = 100 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Remaining Money**:  \n   - Subtract the total cost of purchases from Kelly's total amount of money to find out how much she has left:\n     \\[\n     145 - 100 = 45 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\nThus, after purchasing the can of pop and the candy bar, Kelly will have 45 cents left."
