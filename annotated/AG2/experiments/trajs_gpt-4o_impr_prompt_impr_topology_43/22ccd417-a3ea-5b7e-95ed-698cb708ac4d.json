This means each dose is 448/8 = 56 mL.\n   \n3. **Setting up the Equation for One Dose**:\n   - \\( 4x = 56 \\)\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{56}{4} = 14\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine for each dose.\n\nI will now engage in a discussion with the other agents to see if there are any alternative approaches or considerations."

Given that 448 mL comprised 8 doses, we confirmed that each dose is 56 mL.\n\nAgent Problem Solver articulated the approach well:\n- Establish \\( 4x = 56 \\) and solving gives \\( x = 14 \\).\n\nAgent Code Executor's Python execution also confirmed this result, outputting 14.0.\n\nBoth solutions agree and correctly use the variables as originally stated.
