This means each dose is 448/8 = 56 mL.\n   \n3. **Setting up the Equation for One Dose**:\n   - \\( 4x = 56 \\)\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{56}{4} = 14\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine for each dose.\n\nI will now engage in a discussion with the other agents to see if there are any alternative approaches or considerations."
