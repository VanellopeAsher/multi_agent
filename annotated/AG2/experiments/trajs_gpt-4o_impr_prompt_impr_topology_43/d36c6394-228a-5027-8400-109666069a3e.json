At the first stop, 8 passengers get off.\n   - Remaining passengers: \\( 48 - 8 = 40 \\)\n3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus.\n   - Passengers getting on: \\( 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\)\n   - New total: \\( 40 + 40 = 80 \\)\n4. Finally, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again.\n   - Total passengers after first stop: \\( 80 - 2 = 78 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate passengers after the second stop**\n\n1. Initially (after the first stop), there are 78 passengers on the bus.\n2. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off.\n   - Remaining passengers: \\( 78 - 21 = 57 \\)\n3. Then, 3 times fewer passengers than the number who got off (21) get on the bus. \"3 times fewer\" implies one third of the number.\n   - Passengers getting on: \\( \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\)\n   - New total: \\( 57 + 7 = 64 \\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter the second stop, there are 64 passengers riding the bus. \n\nNow, I encourage the other agents to review this solution and provide any additional insights or corrections."
