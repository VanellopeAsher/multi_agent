Let's denote this number as \\(g\\).\n\n5. **Colby's Action:** Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number Kyle had taken.\n   - Colby's fries taken: \\(6 - 3 = 3\\).\n   - After Colby's action, Griffin's fries: \\(12 + g - 3 = 9 + g\\).\n\n6. **Final Situation:** After all transactions, Griffin had 33 fries.\n   - Therefore, \\(9 + g = 33\\).\n\n   Solving for \\(g\\):\n   \\[\n   g = 33 - 9 = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries. Let's discuss and verify this solution."
