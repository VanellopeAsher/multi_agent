Let's go through the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Expenses:**\n   - Jacket cost: $120\n   - Two pairs of shoes: 2 × $100 = $200\n   - Total expenses = Jacket cost + Cost of shoes \n   - Total expenses = $120 + $200 = $320\n\n2. **Calculate Total Income from Babysitting:**\n   - She babysits 10 times, earning $5 each time.\n   - Total earning from babysitting = 10 × $5 = $50\n\n3. **Calculate her Total Savings before Mowing the Lawn:**\n   - Initial savings = $100\n   - Total savings from babysitting = $50\n   - Total savings before mowing the lawn = $100 + $50 = $150\n\n4. **Determine Remaining Money Needed:**\n   - Money needed to purchase jacket and shoes = Total expenses - Total savings\n   - Money needed = $320 - $150 = $170\n\n5. **Calculate Mowing Lawn Income:**\n   - She earns $10 each time she mows the lawn.\n   - Let \\(n\\) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn.\n   - \\(10n = 170\\) (her earnings from mowing must equal the remaining money she needs)\n\n6. **Solve for \\(n\\):**\n   \\[\n   10n = 170 \\implies n = \\frac{170}{10} = 17\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 17 times to be able to afford her new jacket and two pairs of shoes. \n\nNow I'll engage with the other agents to discuss my approach."
