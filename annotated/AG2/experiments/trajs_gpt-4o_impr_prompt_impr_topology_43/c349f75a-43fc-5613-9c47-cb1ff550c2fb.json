One brother is 12 years old, and the older brother is twice that age, meaning he is 24 years old.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total age by summing up the ages:\n\n- Total age of the sisters = 10 sisters * 16 years = 160 years\n- Total age of the brothers = 12 years + 24 years = 36 years\n\nThen, we add the total ages of the sisters and brothers to get the total age of all siblings.\n\nI will calculate this using Python code. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
