Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

They arrived at the same conclusion using their respective methods.\n\nAgent Problem Solver calculated the total weight by summing up the weights of sugar cubes, carrots, hay, and oats:\n\n- Sugar Cubes: 2 pounds\n- Carrots: 48 pounds\n- Hay: 3150 pounds\n- Oats: 1300 pounds\n\nThe total weight of all the feed is \\(4500\\) pounds.
