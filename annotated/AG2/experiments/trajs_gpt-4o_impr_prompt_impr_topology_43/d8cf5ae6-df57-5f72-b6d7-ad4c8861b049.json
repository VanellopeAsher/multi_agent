Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

They arrived at the same conclusion using their respective methods.\n\nAgent Problem Solver calculated the total weight by summing up the weights of sugar cubes, carrots, hay, and oats:\n\n- Sugar Cubes: 2 pounds\n- Carrots: 48 pounds\n- Hay: 3150 pounds\n- Oats: 1300 pounds\n\nThe total weight of all the feed is \\(4500\\) pounds. Given the farmer wants to transport all the feed in 2 trips, the weight per trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4500 \\text{ pounds}}{2} = 2250 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nAgent Code Executor confirmed this calculation by executing Python code which also resulted in 2250 pounds per trip.\n\nThus, both methods consistently show that the farm truck can carry 2,250 pounds at a time.
