      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then determine how many hours George needs to work to cover this cost after his deposit.\n\nHere are the steps broken down:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Implants**:\n   - George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000.5.\n   - Therefore, the initial cost for the implants without any additional features is \\(2 \\times 2000.5\\).\n\n2. **Add the Cost of the Porcelain Crown**:\n   - One of the implants requires a porcelain crown that costs an extra $500.5. \n   - Add $500.5 to the total cost of the implants.\n\n3. **Total Cost of Dental Work**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = (2 \\times 2000.5) + 500.5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the Deposit**:\n   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.\n   - Subtract this amount from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to pay.\n\n5. **Calculate Hours Needed to Work**:\n   - George earns $15.3 per hour.\n   - Divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage to determine the number of hours he needs to work.\n   - Assuming George needs to work whole hours, we should round up to the nearest whole number since fractional hours would require him to complete another full hour of work.\n\nNow, let’s perform these calculations:\n\n- Total cost for 2 implants: \\(2 \\times 2000.5 = 4001\\)\n- Add porcelain crown cost: \\(4001 + 500.5 = 4501.5\\)\n- Subtract the deposit: \\(4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5\\)\n- Hours needed: \\(\\lceil \\frac{3901.5}{15.3} \\rceil\\)\n\nNow, let's engage with Agent Code Executor or other agents and run some calculations to confirm this."
