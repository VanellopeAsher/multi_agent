So, multiply the number of days (84) by the number of eggs used per day (3).\n   \\[\n   84 \\text{ days} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/day} = 252 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Total Number of Eggs to Dozens**:  \n   Since a dozen equals 12 eggs, divide the total number of eggs (252) by 12 to find out how many dozens she will consume.\n   \\[\n   252 \\text{ eggs} \\div 12 \\text{ eggs/dozen} = 21 \\text{ dozens}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks."
