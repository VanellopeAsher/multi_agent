The statement \"15 years less than ten times the age of his son\" can be translated into an equation.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( S \\) as the age of Carver's son.\n\nNow translate the words into a mathematical equation:\n\\[ 45 = 10S - 15 \\]\n\nThis equation states that Carver's age (45) is equal to \"ten times the son's age minus 15.\"\n\nTo find \\( S \\), solve the equation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Add 15 to both sides of the equation:**\n   \\[\n   45 + 15 = 10S\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   60 = 10S\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 10 to isolate \\( S \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{10} = S\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Carver's son is \\( 6 \\) years old.\n\nI will now discuss this approach with the team.
