      "content": "To determine how much change Carly will get back, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered and then subtract this total cost from the fifty-dollar bill she gives.\n\nLet's start by summarizing and calculating the costs:\n\n1. **Cost of hamburgers**:\n   - Carly orders five hamburgers.\n   - Each hamburger costs $4.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of hamburgers} = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of potato fries**:\n   - Carly orders ten packs of potato fries.\n   - Each pack costs $0.30.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of fries} = 10 \\times 0.30 = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of fruit drinks**:\n   - Carly orders five cans of fruit drinks.\n   - Assume the cost of each can is unknown, let's denote the cost of one can as \\( x \\).\n   - The problem doesn’t provide the cost per drink.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will assume the price for fruit drinks needs to be considered. For the sake of this exercise, unless we’re provided additional information, we’ll assume the canned drinks might also be a certain cost per can, say \\(2\\) dollars for an estimation:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of drinks} = 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n4. **Total cost**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Total cost of hamburgers} + \\text{Total cost of fries} + \\text{Total cost of drinks} = 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Change from fifty-dollar bill**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Change} = 50 - 33 = 17 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Carly gets back $17 in change if the canned drinks indeed cost $2 each. \n\n**Note**: Please confirm the cost of the fruit drinks to provide an accurate change. If you have any further details regarding the cost of the fruit drinks, feel free to share them."
