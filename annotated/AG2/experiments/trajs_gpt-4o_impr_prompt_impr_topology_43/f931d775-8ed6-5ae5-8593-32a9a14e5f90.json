      "content": "Let's break down the problem to find out how many lines Sean needs to memorize.\n\n1. **The Solo Song**: \n   - The song has 54 lines. \n   - Since it's a solo, all lines are Sean's to memorize, so he has 54 lines in the song.\n\n2. **First Scene**:\n   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.\n   - Therefore, the first scene has \\( 54 \\times 2 = 108 \\) lines in total.\n   - Originally, Sean's lines in this scene are one-third of the total lines, giving him \\( \\frac{108}{3} = 36 \\) lines to memorize in the first scene.\n\n3. **Second Scene**:\n   - This scene has 6 more lines than the solo song, resulting in \\( 54 + 6 = 60 \\) lines in total.\n   - Initially, Sean is responsible for four-fifths of the lines, which means he has \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\) lines in this scene.\n\n4. **Adjustments due to Actor Absence**:\n   - Due to the absence of another actor, Sean has to take on an additional 15 lines in the second scene. Therefore, his new responsibility is \\( 48 + 15 = 63 \\) lines in the second scene.\n\n5. **Total Lines to Memorize**:\n   - Now, adding up all the lines Sean needs to memorize, we have:\n     - 54 lines from the solo song,\n     - 36 lines from the first scene,\n     - 63 lines from the second scene.\n\n   Hence, the total number of lines Sean must memorize is \\( 54 + 36 + 63 = 153 \\).\n\nSean has to memorize a total of 153 lines."
