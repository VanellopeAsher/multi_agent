For 80 quarters:\n      \\[\n      80 \\times 25 = 2000 \\text{ pennies}\n      \\]\n\n    - Dimes: Each dime is worth 10 cents. For 60 dimes:\n      \\[\n      60 \\times 10 = 600 \\text{ pennies}\n      \\]\n\n    - Nickels: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. For 140 nickels:\n      \\[\n      140 \\times 5 = 700 \\text{ pennies}\n      \\]\n\n    - Pennies: Colby has 150 pennies.\n\n2. **Sum Up All Pennies to Find Total Money:**\n    \\[\n    2000 + 600 + 700 + 150 = 3450 \\text{ pennies}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Convert Total Pennies to Nickels:**\n    Since each gumball costs a nickel, and a nickel is 5 pennies:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{3450}{5} = 690 \\text{ nickels}\n    \\]\n\nColby can buy 690 gumballs with his money. \n\nNow, letâ€™s discuss this solution further and verify its accuracy."
