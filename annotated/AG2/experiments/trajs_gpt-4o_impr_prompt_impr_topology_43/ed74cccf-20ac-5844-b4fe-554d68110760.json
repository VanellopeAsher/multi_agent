The problem mentions there are some boys as well, but doesn't specify the exact number. To find the total number of soccer players, we'll need to account for these unnamed boys. Let's denote the number of boys by \\( x \\).  \n   Thus, the total number of soccer players is \\( 22 + x \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Students**:  \n   The total number of students is the sum of the tennis players, volleyball players, and soccer players.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students} = 6 + 12 + (22 + x) = 40 + x\n   \\]\n\nTo find the exact total, we need the count of boys playing soccer, denoted by \\( x \\). However, without this specific detail, the expression \"Total number of students = 40 + x\" encompasses all the information given.\n\nLet's discuss if there's any further information needed to find a precise total, or if any assumptions can validly be made based on usual problem-solving approaches."

If we assume \\( x = 0 \\) for simplicity and calculation completion, we get the total as 40 students. But, usually in such problems, \\( x \\neq 0 \\).
