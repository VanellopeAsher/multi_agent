Therefore, the total number of crayon fragments she has is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Crayon Fragments} = 3 \\times 64 = 192\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Number of Muffins**: \n   Kate uses 8 crayon fragments to make each muffin. To find out how many muffins she can make, we divide the total crayon fragments by the number of fragments per muffin:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Muffins} = \\frac{192}{8} = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Earnings**: \n   Kate sells each muffin for $1.50. Hence, the total amount of money she can earn is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 24 \\times 1.50 = 36\n   \\]\n\nThus, Kate can earn a total of $36.00 by selling the crayon muffins."
