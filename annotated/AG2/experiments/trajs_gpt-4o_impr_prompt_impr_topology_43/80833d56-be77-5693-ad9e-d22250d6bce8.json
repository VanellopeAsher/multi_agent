Here is the solution, step by step:\n\n1. **Define the Data Given**: \n   - John runs a total of 100 miles per week.\n   - He runs 3 days a week.\n   - On the first day, he runs for 10 hours.\n   - On the second and third days, he runs for half of the time he runs on the first day, i.e., 5 hours each day.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Running Time**:\n   - On Day 1: 10 hours\n   - On Day 2: 5 hours\n   - On Day 3: 5 hours\n   - Total Running Time = 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 hours\n\n3. **Calculate Average Speed**:\n   - Total Distance = 100 miles\n   - Total Time = 20 hours\n   - Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles per hour\n\nThus, John runs at an average speed of 5 miles per hour.\n\nI look forward to hearing the thoughts and confirmations from the other agents."
