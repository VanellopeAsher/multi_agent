We'll convert all coins into cents:\n\n1. **Quarters**: \n   - Colby has 8 quarters\n   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents\n   - Total from quarters = \\(8 \\times 25 = 200\\) cents\n\n2. **Dimes**: \n   - Colby has 6 dimes\n   - Each dime is worth 10 cents\n   - Total from dimes = \\(6 \\times 10 = 60\\) cents\n\n3. **Nickels**: \n   - Colby has 14 nickels\n   - Each nickel is worth 5 cents\n   - Total from nickels = \\(14 \\times 5 = 70\\) cents\n\n4. **Pennies**: \n   - Colby has 15 pennies\n   - Each penny is worth 1 cent\n   - Total from pennies = \\(15 \\times 1 = 15\\) cents\n\n### Step 2: Compute Total Cash\nAdd up the total from all coin types to get the total amount of money Colby has:\n\n- Total money = \\(200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345\\) cents\n\n### Step 3: Determine How Many Gumballs Colby Can Buy\nAssuming each gumball costs 5 cents (*typical cost unless specified otherwise*), we calculate the number of gumballs Colby can purchase:\n\n- Each gumball costs 5 cents\n- Number of gumballs = \\(\\frac{345}{5} = 69\\)\n\nTherefore, Colby can buy **69 gumballs**.\n\nNow, I will engage in discussion with my fellow agents to validate this approach and consider any alternative methods or insights."
