      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute Peter's $70 evenly across the 7 days of the week and then calculate the number of action figures he can buy each day based on his daily budget.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Daily Budget Calculation**: \n   Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. So, the daily spending amount will be calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily Budget} = \\frac{\\text{\\$70}}{7 \\text{ days}} = \\$10 \\text{ per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Days 1-4 (Sunday to Wednesday) - Wooden Action Figures**:\n   - Peter spends $10 each day.\n   - Cost of each wooden action figure = $5.\n   - Number of wooden action figures per day = $\\frac{\\$10}{\\$5} = 2$ wooden action figures.\n\n   Therefore, from Sunday to Wednesday (4 days), the total number of wooden action figures Peter buys is:\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ figures/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 8 \\text{ wooden action figures}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Days 5-7 (Thursday to Saturday) - Plastic Action Figures**:\n   - Peter also spends $10 each day.\n   - Cost of each plastic action figure = $2.5.\n   - Number of plastic action figures per day = $\\frac{\\$10}{\\$2.5} = 4$ plastic action figures.\n\n   Therefore, from Thursday to Saturday (3 days), the total number of plastic action figures Peter buys is:\n\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ figures/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 12 \\text{ plastic action figures}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Action Figures**:\n   - Total wooden action figures = 8.\n   - Total plastic action figures = 12.\n\n   Thus, the total number of action figures Peter has by the end of the week is:\n\n   \\[\n   8 + 12 = 20 \\text{ action figures}\n   \\]\n\nPeter will have a total of 20 action figures by the end of the week if he evenly distributes his spending and purchases action figures as described. Now, I look forward to discussing this with my fellow agents, particularly Agent Code Executor, to verify and possibly compute the solution programmatically."

Let's confirm the computations by writing a Python script to simulate Peter's spending and calculate the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week.\n\nWe'll leverage SymPy or straightforward Python calculations to validate the problem-solving steps you described. We will perform the following:\n\n1. Calculate the number of figures bought each day, given the specific budget and figure prices.\n2. Sum the total number for accuracy.\n\nLet's proceed with the code implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define the total amount Peter has\ntotal_amount = 70\n\n# Define the number of days in the week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Calculate the daily budget\ndaily_budget = total_amount / days_in_week\n\n# Define cost of each type of figure\nwooden_figure_cost = 5\nplastic_figure_cost = 2.5\n\n# Calculate the number of wooden figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday\nwooden_figures_per_day = daily_budget // wooden_figure_cost\ntotal_wooden_figures = wooden_figures_per_day * 4  # 4 days\n\n# Calculate the number of plastic figures bought from Thursday to Saturday\nplastic_figures_per_day = daily_budget // plastic_figure_cost\ntotal_plastic_figures = plastic_figures_per_day * 3 # 3 days\n\n# Calculate the total number of figures\ntotal_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\n# Print the total number of figures\nprint(total_figures)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
