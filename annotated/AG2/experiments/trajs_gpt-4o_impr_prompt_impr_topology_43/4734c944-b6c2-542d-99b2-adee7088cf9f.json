      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute Peter's $70 evenly across the 7 days of the week and then calculate the number of action figures he can buy each day based on his daily budget.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Daily Budget Calculation**: \n   Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. So, the daily spending amount will be calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily Budget} = \\frac{\\text{\\$70}}{7 \\text{ days}} = \\$10 \\text{ per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Days 1-4 (Sunday to Wednesday) - Wooden Action Figures**:\n   - Peter spends $10 each day.\n   - Cost of each wooden action figure = $5.\n   - Number of wooden action figures per day = $\\frac{\\$10}{\\$5} = 2$ wooden action figures.\n\n   Therefore, from Sunday to Wednesday (4 days), the total number of wooden action figures Peter buys is:\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ figures/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 8 \\text{ wooden action figures}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Days 5-7 (Thursday to Saturday) - Plastic Action Figures**:\n   - Peter also spends $10 each day.\n   - Cost of each plastic action figure = $2.5.\n   - Number of plastic action figures per day = $\\frac{\\$10}{\\$2.5} = 4$ plastic action figures.\n\n   Therefore, from Thursday to Saturday (3 days), the total number of plastic action figures Peter buys is:\n\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ figures/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 12 \\text{ plastic action figures}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Action Figures**:\n   - Total wooden action figures = 8.\n   - Total plastic action figures = 12.\n\n   Thus, the total number of action figures Peter has by the end of the week is:\n\n   \\[\n   8 + 12 = 20 \\text{ action figures}\n   \\]\n\nPeter will have a total of 20 action figures by the end of the week if he evenly distributes his spending and purchases action figures as described. Now, I look forward to discussing this with my fellow agents, particularly Agent Code Executor, to verify and possibly compute the solution programmatically."
