Therefore, her earnings from the cookies are:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from cookies} = 80 \\times 1 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Earnings from Cupcakes**:\n   - Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each. Therefore, her earnings from the cupcakes are:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from cupcakes} = 60 \\times 4 = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Earnings**:\n   - To find Suzanne's total earnings, we add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total earnings} = 80 + 240 = 320 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Expenses**:\n   - Suzanne gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so the total given to her sisters is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total given to sisters} = 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Additionally, she donated $15 to a local charity:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Donation to charity} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total expenses (sisters and charity) are:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total expenses} = 20 + 15 = 35 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Money Left Over**:\n   - To find out how much money Suzanne has left, subtract the total expenses from her total earnings:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Money left} = 320 - 35 = 285 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nSuzanne has $285 left from her earnings after giving money to her sisters and making a donation to charity."
