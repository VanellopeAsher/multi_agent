On Day 3, the total water flow is 14,000 gallons.\n\nWe need to calculate the increase in the amount of water from Day 2 to Day 3.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n- Water flow on Day 2 = 8000 gallons.\n- Water flow on Day 3 = 14000 gallons.\n\nIncrease from Day 2 to Day 3 = Water flow on Day 3 - Water flow on Day 2\n\nIncrease = 14000 - 8000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nSo, the increase in the amount of water on the third day is 6000 gallons."
