Therefore, his earnings from babysitting are:\n   - \\[\n   7 \\text{ days} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 0 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 0 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Total Income**: Thus, Gerald's total income for the week is:\n\\[\n210 \\text{ dollars (from daycare)} + 0 \\text{ dollars (from babysitting)} = 210 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Expenses Calculation:**\n- Gerald spent $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n\n**Amount Left Calculation:**\nTo find out how much money Gerald has left after his expenses, subtract his expenses from his total income:\n\\[\n210 \\text{ dollars} - 100 \\text{ dollars} = 110 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Gerald has $110 left after covering his weekly expenses."
