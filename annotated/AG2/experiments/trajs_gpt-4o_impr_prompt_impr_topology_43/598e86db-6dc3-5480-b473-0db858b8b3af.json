Then, we'll use the information about the total number of people he helps and the number of hours he works each day to find out how many people he helps per hour.\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Days**:\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April has 19 days up to April 19th.\n   - Total days from March 1st to April 19th = 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\n2. **Determine Days Off**:\n   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.\n   - Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 × 50 = 10 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Working Days**:\n   - Total working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Hours Worked**:\n   - Billy works 3 hours per day.\n   - Total hours worked = 40 days × 3 hours/day = 120 hours.\n\n5. **Total People Helped**:\n   - Billy helps 240 people in total.\n\n6. **Calculate the Number of People Helped Per Hour**:\n   - People helped per hour = Total people helped / Total hours worked.\n   - People helped per hour = 240 / 120 = 2 people per hour.\n\nTherefore, Billy helps 2 people per hour."
