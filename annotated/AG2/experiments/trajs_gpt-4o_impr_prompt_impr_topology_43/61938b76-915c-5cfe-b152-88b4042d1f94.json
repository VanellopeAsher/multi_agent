Hence, the total cost for 60 biscuits is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\times 0.10 = \\$6.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the change from the $10 note:**  \n   Carl gives a $10 note to pay for the biscuits, which cost $6.00. Therefore, his change will be:\n   \\[\n   10.00 - 6.00 = \\$4.00\n   \\]\n\nThus, Carl will receive $4.00 as change."
