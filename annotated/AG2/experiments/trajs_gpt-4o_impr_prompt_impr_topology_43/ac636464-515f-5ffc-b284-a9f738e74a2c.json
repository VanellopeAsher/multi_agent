      "content": "To solve this problem, start by breaking down the journey into different partsâ€”the initial swim, the rest, and the final swim. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Distance Across the Lake**: \n   \n   The total distance of the lake is 30 miles, as given.\n\n2. **Determine Distance Swum Initially**:\n\n   Since James initially swims 70% of the distance, calculate 70% of 30 miles:\n\n   \\[\n   0.7 \\times 30 = 21 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Time for the Initial Swimming Phase**:\n\n   James swims at 3 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to swim 21 miles at 3 mph is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Rest Time**:\n\n   The rest period is half the time spent swimming initially. Thus, the rest time is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine Remaining Distance to Swim**:\n\n   The remaining distance to cover is the total distance minus the initial distance swum:\n\n   \\[\n   30 - 21 = 9 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Time for the Final Swimming Phase**:\n\n   For the final 9 miles, James swims at half his speed, i.e., \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to swim 9 miles at 1.5 mph is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{1.5} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate Total Time**:\n\n   Add up all the time spent during each phase (initial swim, rest, and final swim):\n\n   \\[\n   7 + 3.5 + 6 = 16.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it takes James a total of 16.5 hours to get across the lake. \n\nLet me know if this approach aligns with your understanding, or if there are any discrepancies to discuss further."

He swims the 21 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour, taking 7 hours.\n3. He rests for half of the swimming time, equating to 3.5 hours.\n4. He swims the remaining 9 miles at half the original speed, specifically 1.5 miles per hour, taking an additional 6 hours.\n5.
