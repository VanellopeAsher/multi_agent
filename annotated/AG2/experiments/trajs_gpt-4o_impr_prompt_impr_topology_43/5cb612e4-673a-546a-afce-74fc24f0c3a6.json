Here's a step-by-step outline of the solution:\n\n1. **Identify Costs and Revenue**:\n   - **Cost per bag**: The total cost per bag includes the buying cost and the transportation cost.\n     - Buying cost per bag = $20\n     - Transportation cost per bag = $2\n     - Total cost per bag = $20 + $2 = $22\n\n2. **Selling Price per Bag**:\n   - Selling price per bag = $30\n\n3. **Profit Calculation**:\n   - Profit per bag = Selling price per bag - Total cost per bag\n   - Profit per bag = $30 - $22 = $8\n\n4. **Total Profit**:\n   - Total profit made from selling 'n' bags = Profit per bag Ã— Number of bags\n   - We know the total profit is $400\n   - Thus, $8 * Number of bags = $400\n\n5. **Solve for the Number of Bags (n)**:\n   - Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag\n   - Number of bags = $400 / $8 = 50\n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. \n\nLet's discuss and verify this solution with the other agents."
