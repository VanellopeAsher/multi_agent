Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 64 = 192 \\text{ crayon pieces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Muffin Crayons Made**:  \n   Since each muffin crayon is made by melting 8 small pieces together, we need to calculate how many muffin crayons Kate can make:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{192}{8} = 24 \\text{ muffin crayons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Selling Price per Muffin Crayon**:  \n   Kate sold all her muffin crayons for a total of $36. Therefore, the selling price for each muffin crayon is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{24} = 1.5 \\text{ dollars per muffin crayon}\n   \\]\n\nHence, each muffin crayon sells for $1.50."
