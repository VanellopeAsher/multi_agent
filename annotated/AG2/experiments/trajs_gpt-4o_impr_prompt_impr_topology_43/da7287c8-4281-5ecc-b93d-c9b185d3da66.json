Let's break it down to ensure we understand each step involved:\n\n1. **Calculate Income from Milkshakes**: Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.\n   - Income from milkshakes = Number of milkshakes * Price per milkshake\n\n2. **Calculate Income from Burger Platters**: Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11.50 each.\n   - Income from burger platters = Number of burger platters * Price per burger platter\n\n3. **Calculate Income from Sodas**: Terry sells half of 40 sodas at $1.50 each. This means he sells 20 sodas.\n   - Income from sodas = Number of sodas sold (*half of 40*) * Price per soda\n\n4. **Calculate Total Income**: Sum all the individual incomes from milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas to find the total income.\n\nI will write and execute the Python code to compute these values. \n\n```python\n# Prices and quantities of each item\nmilkshake_price = 5.50\nmilkshake_quantity = 6\n\nburger_platter_price = 11.50\nburger_platter_quantity = 9\n\nsoda_price = 1.50\nsoda_quantity = 40 / 2  # since he sells half of 40\n\n# Calculate total income from each item\ntotal_income_milkshakes = milkshake_price * milkshake_quantity\ntotal_income_burger_platters = burger_platter_price * burger_platter_quantity\ntotal_income_sodas = soda_price * soda_quantity\n\n# Calculate total income\ntotal_income = total_income_milkshakes + total_income_burger_platters + total_income_sodas\n\nprint(total_income)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
