Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[\n40x + 30 \\times 80 = 3200\n\\]\n\nLet's now solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, calculate how much she spent on celery seeds:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 80 = 2400\n\\]\n\nNow substitute this back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n40x + 2400 = 3200\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2400 from both sides to solve for \\( 40x \\):\n\n\\[\n40x = 800\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 40:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{800}{40} = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds."
