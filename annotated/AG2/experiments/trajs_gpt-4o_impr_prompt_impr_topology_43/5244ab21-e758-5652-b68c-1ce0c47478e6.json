Let's outline the step-by-step solution to find the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Oranges**: \n   - Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes.\n   - Each box contains 20 oranges.\n   - Total oranges = 12 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.\n\n2. **Deduct the Gifted Oranges**:\n   - Mrs. Harrington gifted her mother 2 boxes.\n   - Mrs. Harrington gifted her sibling 2 boxes.\n   - Oranges gifted = 4 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 80 oranges.\n   - Remaining oranges after gifting = 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges.\n\n3. **Determine the Oranges Retained by Mrs. Harrington**:\n   - Mrs. Harrington kept a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself.\n   - Oranges retained = (1/4) × 160 oranges = 40 oranges.\n\n4. **Calculate the Oranges Sold**:\n   - Remaining oranges after retaining = 160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges.\n   - Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.\n\nHence, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges. \n\nI'm ready to discuss this approach with the team and see if anyone has alternate calculations or suggestions."
