Therefore, due to the lack of exact numerical shark body length, the solution remains an expression rather than a concrete numerical percentage.\n\n**Final Solution**: Given a shark body length \\(S\\), the remoras' combined length is\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{12}{S} \\times 100}\n\\]\npercent of the shark's body length. This approach accounts for the missing information by accurately expressing the percentage in terms of \\(S\\). If \\(S\\) were provided, this expression could produce a precise percentage value."
