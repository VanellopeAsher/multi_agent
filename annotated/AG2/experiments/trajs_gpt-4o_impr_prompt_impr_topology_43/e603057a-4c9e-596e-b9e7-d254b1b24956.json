Let's denote Seth's current age as \\( S \\) and Brooke's current age as \\( B \\).\n2. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   S = 2B\n   \\]\n\n3. In 3 years, the ages of Seth and Brooke will be \\( S + 3 \\) and \\( B + 3 \\) respectively. The sum of their ages in 3 years is given as 36. So the second equation is:\n   \\[\n   (S + 3) + (B + 3) = 36\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   S + B + 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve the simplified equation for \\( S + B \\):\n   \\[\n   S + B = 30\n   \\]\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\\[\nS = 2B\n\\]\n\\[\nS + B = 30\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( S \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\n2B + B = 30\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n3B = 30\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( B \\):\n\\[\nB = 10\n\\]\n\nNow substitute back to find \\( S \\):\n\\[\nS = 2B = 2(10) = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, Seth is currently 20 years old."
