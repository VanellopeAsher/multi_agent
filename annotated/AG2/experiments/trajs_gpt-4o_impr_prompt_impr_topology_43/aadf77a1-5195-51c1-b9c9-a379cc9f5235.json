Each medium shirt contributes 4 square feet of fabric.  \n   Therefore, the total fabric from medium shirts = \\(8 \\, \\text{shirts} \\times 4 \\, \\text{square feet/shirt} = 32 \\, \\text{square feet}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Fabric Contribution from Large Shirts**:  \n   Octavia used 6 large shirts. Each large shirt contributes 6 square feet of fabric.  \n   Therefore, the total fabric from large shirts = \\(6 \\, \\text{shirts} \\times 6 \\, \\text{square feet/shirt} = 36 \\, \\text{square feet}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Fabric Contribution from Small Shirts**:  \n   The total fabric needed for the quilt is 101 square feet.  \n   Fabric from medium and large shirts = 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 68 square feet.  \n   Fabric from small shirts = Total fabric - Fabric from medium and large shirts.  \n   Fabric from small shirts = 101 square feet - 68 square feet = 33 square feet.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Small Shirts Used**:  \n   Each small shirt contributes 3 square feet of fabric.  \n   Number of small shirts = Total fabric from small shirts / Fabric per small shirt  \n   Number of small shirts = 33 square feet / 3 square feet/shirt = 11 shirts.\n\nTherefore, Octavia used 11 small shirts for the quilt.
