Therefore, the cost for the one-gallon jars is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for one-gallon jars} = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Cost for Half-Gallon Jars**:  \n   - Cecelia also purchases 16 jars of half gallon at $3 each. Thus, the cost for the half-gallon jars is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for half-gallon jars} = 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the Costs**:  \n   - The total expenditure is the sum of the costs for the one-gallon jars and the half-gallon jars:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total expenditure} = 50 + 48 = 98 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Cecelia spent a total of $98 on her purchases."
