Given the problem statement:\n\n- They make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, which means they also make \\( x \\) chimichangas on Wednesday.\n- On Friday, they make twice the amount made on Tuesday, which is \\( 2x \\).\n\nThe total number of chimichangas made across these three days is 500. Thus, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ x + x + 2x = 500 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4x = 500 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{500}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 125 \\]\n\nTherefore, they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.\n\nNow, I'll summarize the solution steps:\n\n1. Define \\( x \\) as the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n2. On Wednesday, they make the same number, so \\( x \\).\n3. On Friday, they make twice that amount, so \\( 2x \\).\n4. Set up the equation: \\( x + x + 2x = 500 \\).\n5. Simplify to \\( 4x = 500 \\).\n6. Solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 125 \\).\n\nThus, Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday."
