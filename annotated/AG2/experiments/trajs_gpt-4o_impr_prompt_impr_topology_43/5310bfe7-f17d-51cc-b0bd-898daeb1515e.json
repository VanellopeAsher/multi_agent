Let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Analyze Richie's Goal Stats**:  \n   - Richie scored 90 goals.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations for Mark and Anna**:  \n   - Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n   - Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\n3. **Calculate Mark's Goals**:\n   - Let the number of goals Mark scored be \\( M \\).\n   - According to the problem, Richie scored 30 more than Mark:\n     \\[\n     M + 30 = 90\n     \\]\n   - Solving this equation:\n     \\[\n     M = 90 - 30 = 60\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Anna's Goals**:\n   - Let the number of goals Anna scored be \\( A \\).\n   - Richie scored 55 more than Anna:\n     \\[\n     A + 55 = 90\n     \\]\n   - Solving this equation:\n     \\[\n     A = 90 - 55 = 35\n     \\]\n\n5. **Summing Up All Goals**:\n   - Total goals scored by all teenagers:\n     \\[\n     90 \\, (\\text{Richie}) + 60 \\, (\\text{Mark}) + 35 \\, (\\text{Anna}) = 185\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, all three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."
