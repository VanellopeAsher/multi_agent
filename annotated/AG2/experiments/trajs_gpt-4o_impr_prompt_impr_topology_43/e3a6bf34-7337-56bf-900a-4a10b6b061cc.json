      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine Quantity of Yellow Ties:**\n   - John spent $300 on yellow ties.\n   - Each yellow tie costs $30.\n   - Therefore, the number of yellow ties he purchased is calculated by dividing the total spent by the cost per tie:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of yellow ties} = \\frac{300}{30} = 10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Cost and Quantity of Green Ties:**\n   - Green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties.\n   - Cost of one green tie:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of green tie} = \\text{Cost of yellow tie} + 0.7 \\times \\text{Cost of yellow tie} = 30 + 0.7 \\times 30 = 51\n     \\]\n   - Assuming John buys the same number of green ties as yellow ties (a logical assumption unless otherwise stated in the problem), he buys 10 green ties.\n   - Total cost for green ties:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost of green ties} = 10 \\times 51 = 510\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determining Cost and Quantity of Blue and Red Ties:**\n   - There’s insufficient information to determine how many blue and red ties are bought or their costs. Assuming he buys zero blue ties means zero red ties given they are multiples of blue ties.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Expenditure on Ties:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of yellow ties + Cost of green ties + Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties\n   - \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 300 + 510 + 0 + 0 = 810\n   \\]\n\nGiven the lack of specific data for blue and red ties, which normally affects part of the expense, the problem is focused on the amount definitely spent on yellow and green ties.\n\nTherefore, John spent $810 on his ties. This assumes further insight is not provided on additional colors in the problem context. Would love to have further validation from Agent Verifier or insights from other agents."

The result should reaffirm the computations carried out verbally.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Given that information was not included and assumptions about their costs or numbers would be speculative, computations were focused on available data: yellow and green ties.\n\nBoth solutions point to John spending a total of $810.
