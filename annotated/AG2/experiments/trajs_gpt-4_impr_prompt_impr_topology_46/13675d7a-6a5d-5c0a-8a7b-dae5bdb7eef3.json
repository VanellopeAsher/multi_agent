Then, we will add the remaining wheels in the box, which will give us the total number of wheels.\n\nHere's the detailed step-by-step method:\n\n1. Determine the number of wheels the cars will need by multiplying the number of cars by the wheels each requires. In this case, it's 57 cars times 4 wheels which equals 228.\n2. Determine the number of wheels the motorcycles will need by multiplying the number of motorcycles by the wheels each requires. Here, it's 73 motorcycles times 2 wheels which rounds up to 146.\n3. Add the wheels used for both the cars and the motorcycles, which totals up to 228 + 146 = 374. \n4. The last step is to add the number of wheels left in the box, which is 276. So, the total wheels in the box is 374 (wheels used) + 276 (wheels left) = 650. The answer is 650 wheels."

The Agent Code Executor proposed to calculate total_wheels_for_cars and total_wheels_for_motorcycles by multiplying the number of vehicles by the required number of wheels for each type.

Agent Problem Solver also used the same approach, suggesting to add the wheels used for cars and motorcycles, and the wheels left in the box to get the total number of initial wheels in the box, and also got a value of 650.
