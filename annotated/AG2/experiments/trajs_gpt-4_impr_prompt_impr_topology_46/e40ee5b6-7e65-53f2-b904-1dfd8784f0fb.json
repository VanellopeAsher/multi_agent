From the provided information, the one-gallon jar costs $5. To find the price of a half-gallon jar, subtract the price difference from the price of the one-gallon jar. So, the half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.\n3. Calculate the total cost of one-gallon jars. As there are 10 one-gallon jars, the total cost for these is 10 * $5 = $50.\n4. Calculate the total cost of half-gallon jars. As there are 16 half-gallon jars, the total cost for these is 16 * $3 = $48.\n5. Add up the total costs to get the answer. So, the total amount Cecelia spent is $50 + $48 = $98. \n\nSo Cecelia spent a total of $98."
