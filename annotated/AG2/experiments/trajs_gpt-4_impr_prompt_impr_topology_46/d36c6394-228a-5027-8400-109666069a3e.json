Then, 5 times as many people as the ones who got off get on. Since 8 people got off, then 8 * 5 = 40 people get on the bus. The total number of passengers on the bus after this will be 40 (current passengers) + 40 (new passengers) = 80 passengers.\n4. Two people who just got on decide to get off again. This reduces the number of passengers to 80 - 2 = 78 passengers.\n5. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. This leaves us with 78 - 21 = 57 passengers.\n6. Then, 3 times fewer passengers as the ones who got off get on. Since 21 people got off, then 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. The total number of passengers on the bus after this will be 57 (current passengers) + 7 (new passengers) = 64 passengers.\n\nSo, the total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 64."
