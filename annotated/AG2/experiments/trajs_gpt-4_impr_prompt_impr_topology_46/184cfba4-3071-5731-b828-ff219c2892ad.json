We use this equation to solve for the number of animals sold:\n\nSmall stuffed animals' sales + Large stuffed animals' sales = Total sales\n$40*(2x) + $120*x = $1200\n\nWe can then solve this equation for `x` to find the number of large stuffed animals sold. Once we know that, we simply double that number to find the number of small stuffed animals sold. However, we first need to simplify the equation on the left side:  \n\n80x + 120x = 200x = $1200.\n\nLet's solve this step by step further."
