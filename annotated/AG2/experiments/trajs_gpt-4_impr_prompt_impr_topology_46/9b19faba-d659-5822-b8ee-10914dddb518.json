First, we need to figure out the number of gingerbread boxes Sunny sold in three days. \n  - Saturday: 10 boxes. \n  - Sunday: 5 more than Saturday, which means 10 + 5 = 15 boxes.\n  - Monday: 2 boxes.\n\n2. We add up to get the total number of gingerbread boxes sold, which is: 10 + 15 + 2 = 27 boxes.\n\n3. Next, we need to figure out the number of apple pie boxes Sunny sold in three days.\n  - Sunday: 15 boxes.\n  - Saturday: 4 less than Sunday, which means 15 - 4 = 11 boxes.\n  - Monday: 4 boxes.\n\n4. We add up to get the total number of apple pie boxes sold, which is: 11 + 15 + 4 = 30 boxes.\n\n5. We then multiply the total number of each box sold times the price of each box.\n   - For gingerbread: 27 boxes * $6 = $162\n   - For apple pie: 30 boxes * $15 = $450\n\n6. Finally, we add these amounts to get the total earnings for Sunny.\n\nLet's discuss this approach and move forward."
