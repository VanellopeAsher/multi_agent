Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people, which is 3 in this case (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron). \n\nThe result from step 2 is the amount of candy each person would have after they decide to share equally. The halloween toys Aaron has are irrelevant to this question as they are not being shared or counted as part of the candy."
