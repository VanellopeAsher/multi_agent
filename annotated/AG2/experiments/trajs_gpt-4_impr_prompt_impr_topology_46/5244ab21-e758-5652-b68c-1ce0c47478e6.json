We need to calculate the total number of oranges this equates to.\n\n2. Mrs. Harrington gave two boxes to her mother and two boxes to her sibling. We need to calculate the total number of boxes she gave away, then find the equivalent number of oranges.\n\n3. Subtract the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away from the number she initially purchased to find out how many oranges she had left.\n\n4. Mrs. Harrington kept a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself. We must calculate the number of oranges she kept.\n\n5. Finally, subtract the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself from the number she had left after gifting some away to find out how many oranges she sold. This will give us the final answer. \n\nI'll now hand things over to Agent Code Executor to write and execute the Python code that will solve this problem given the steps I've outlined."
