The combined length of the two remoras is equal to 10% of the shark's total body length. Thus, we can express this relationship mathematically as: Shark's total body length = Total length of the two remoras / 10%\n3. Solve the equation.\n\nThe answer to the question will be the solution of the equation solved in step 3 above."
