Since the first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, that's 54 * 2 = 108 lines.\n2. However, only one third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.\n3. Next, we need to find out the number of lines in the second scene. Since the second scene has six more lines than the song, that's 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\n4. Four fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines for the second scene.\n5. Finally, because one actor can't come, Sean has to memorize an additional 15 lines for the second scene, bringing the total for the second scene to 48 + 15 = 63 lines.\n6. Add up the number of lines Sean has to memorize for the song (54 lines), the first scene (36 lines), and the second scene (63 lines), which gives us 54 + 36 + 63 = 153 lines.\n\nSo, Sean has to memorize 153 lines in total."
