The amount doubles after a heavy rain, this means it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.\n3. On the third day, the total volume becomes 14000 gallons.\n4. We want to find the increase on the third day, which is calculated by subtracting the total amount of water after the double from the total amount on the third day. That is 14000 - 8000.\n\nThis would be the solution step by step. Now, let's do the calculations."
