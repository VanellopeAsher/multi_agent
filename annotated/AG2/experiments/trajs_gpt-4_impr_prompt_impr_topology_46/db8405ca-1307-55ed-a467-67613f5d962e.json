To do this, Ali should multiply the number of tables (40) by the cost per table ($200). Let's denote this value as T.\n\n2. Next, calculate the total cost for the roof frames. This is simply the number of roof frames (20) multiplied by the cost per frame ($100). Let's denote this value as R.\n\n3. Finally, to determine the total cost, Ali should add the total cost for both the tables (T) and the roof frames (R).\n\n4. The total amount that Ali has to pay John can then be defined as:\n\n    Total cost = T + R\n\nBy following these steps, Ali will be able to calculate the total amount owed to John."
