Calculate the number of cards left after Jane's rejection: 350 cards - 10 cards (Jane rejected) = 340 cards\n5. Deduct the number of cards Miss Maria keeps: 340 cards - 50 cards (Maria keeps) = 290 cards\n6. Finally, we divide the final total by the number of cards each student gets to find the number of students: 290 cards / 10 cards per student = 29 students\n\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 29 students, according to my calculation."
