Given that he drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, he would need 90/30 = 3 bottles of water to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle.\n\nAdding these together, for both puzzles, he would drink a total of 1 + 3 = 4 bottles of water.\n \nHence, John drinks 4 bottles of water to solve both a normal and an extreme sudoku puzzle."
