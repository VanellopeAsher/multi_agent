Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week: Gerald earns $30 every day and there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, for the entire week, Gerald earns 30 * 7 = $210.\n  \n2. Calculate Gerald's expenses: To find out how much Gerald spent, we subtract the amount he saved from his total earnings. Therefore, Gerald's expenses are $210 (Total earnings) - $110 (Savings) = $100. \n\nTherefore, Gerald spent $100 during that week."
