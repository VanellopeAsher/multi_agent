P + J + Paul = 100 (since their combined age is 100 years)\n2. Paul = J + 18 (since Paul is 18 years older than John)\n3. P = J + Paul (since Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)\n\nWe can then proceed to solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of P (Peter's age).\n\nStep 1: Substitute equation (2) into equation (3) to get a new equation for P.\n\nStep 2: Substitute this new equation and equation (2) into equation (1) to solve for J (John's age).\n\nStep 3: Substitute the value of J found in step 2 into equation (2) to get Paul's age.\n\nStep 4: Finally substitute the values for J and Paul found in steps 2 and 3 into equation (1) to confirm if P (Peter's age) equates to the sum of Paul and John's age. \n\nThis is how I would approach the problem.
