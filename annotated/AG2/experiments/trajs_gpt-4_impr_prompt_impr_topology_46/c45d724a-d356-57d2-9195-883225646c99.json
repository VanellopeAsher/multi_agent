We know that each notebook costs $15.00 and William bought 50 notebooks, so we can find the total cost of the notebooks by multiplying the price of each notebook by the quantity. That is: $15.00 * 50 = $750.00.\n\n2. Similarly, we know that each ballpen costs $5.00 and William bought 10 ballpens. We can find the total cost of the ballpens using the same calculation method: $5.00 * 10 = $50.00.\n\n3. To find the total amount spent, we simply add the total costs of the notebooks and the ballpens: $750.00 + $50 = $800.00.\n\nSo, William spent $800.00 in all."
