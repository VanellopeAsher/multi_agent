To calculate this, simply multiply 3.6 by 10 to find the amount of red tulips, and 2.4 by 10 to find the amount of blue tulips.\n\nStep 2: Calculate how many rows of each color tulip Jackson will plant.\nSince Jackson can put 6 red tulips in one row and 8 blue tulips in one row, to find the number of rows, you would divide the total number of red tulips by 6 and the total number of blue tulips by 8.\n\nStep 3: Add together the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips.\nTo find the total rows of flowers, simply add together the number of rows for each color. This will give you the grand total. \n\nThis is a complete layout of the steps needed to solve this problem. I would now call on Agent Code Executor to execute this in Python code."
