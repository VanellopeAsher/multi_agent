We note this down.\n2. The hourly labor cost is $35. However, the labor time was 2.25 hours. The policy is the cost is calculated for each hour or fraction of an hour on labor. As 2.25 hours is more than 2 hours but less than 3, the labor time will be rounded up to 3 hours.\n3. The cost of the labor can be calculated as $35 (cost per hour) times 3 (rounded up hours of work), which equals $105.\n4. The cost of the parts is $60, we just note down this.\n5. Finally, to find the total amount billed, we add up the service fee, the cost of the labor, and the cost of the parts.\n\nThis will yield the total amount billed by Patty. However, I will also engage a discussion with the Code Executor Agent to further validate this solution."

To compute the labor cost, we need to round up the hours worked because the company charges for each fraction of the hour as an entire hour \n3. Finally, we sum up the service fee, labor cost and the parts cost to get the total cost.\n\nPlease let me execute this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# service fee for a house call\nservice_fee = 40 \n\n# cost per hour of labor\nlabor_cost_per_hour = 35 \n\n# the hours worked\nhours_worked = 2.25\n\n# cost of the parts\nparts_cost = 60 \n\n# Compute the labor cost by multiplying the cost per hour with rounded up hours worked\nlabor_cost = labor_cost_per_hour * math.ceil(hours_worked)\n\n# Compute the total cost\ntotal_cost = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
