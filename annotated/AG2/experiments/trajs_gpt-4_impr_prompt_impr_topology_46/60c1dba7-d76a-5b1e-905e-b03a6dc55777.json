Define the variables:\n- Let's represent the number of cards that PJ has as 'P'.\n- Given that Smendrick has 4 times the number of cards that PJ has, we can represent Smendrick's amount as '4P'.\n- And since Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick, we can represent Becca's amount as '(4P+15)'.\n\n2. Set up the equation:\n- As per the problem statement, the total number of cards is 447. We can set up the equation as follows: P + 4P + (4P + 15) = 447.\n\n3. Solve the equation:\n- We can solve the above equation for 'P' to find out the number of cards that PJ has. \n\n4. Find the number of cards that Becca has:\n- Once we've solved the equation for 'P', we can find out the number of cards that Becca has by substituting 'P' in '(4P+15)'.\n\nThis should give us the solution.
