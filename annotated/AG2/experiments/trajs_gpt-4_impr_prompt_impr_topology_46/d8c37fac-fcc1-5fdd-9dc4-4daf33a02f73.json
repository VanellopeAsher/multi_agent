      "content": "Let's approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Compute the cost for the flowers in a single basket by summing the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines. From the given problem, we know that Katherine wants to place 30 petunias priced at $3.00 each and 20 sweet potato vines priced at $2.50 each in every hanging basket. As a result, the total cost of the flowers for one basket can be calculated as:\n   `(30 * price of one petunia) + (20 * price of one sweet potato vine)`\n\n2. To obtain the total cost for all 50 baskets, we must multiply the cost of one basket by the total number of baskets. Hence,\n   `Cost for all baskets = 50 * cost of one basket` \n\nBy inserting the given values and solving, we will get the total cost Katherine will spend filling all 50 hanging baskets."
