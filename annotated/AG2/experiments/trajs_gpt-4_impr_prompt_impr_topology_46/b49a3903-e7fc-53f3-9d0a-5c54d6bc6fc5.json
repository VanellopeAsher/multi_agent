      "content": "First, let's determine how many rows each color of tulip will require:\n\n1. To find the number of rows of red tulips Jackson will plant, divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 red tulips รท 6 red tulips/row = 6 rows of red tulips.\n\n2. To find the number of rows of blue tulips Jackson will plant, divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row: 24 blue tulips รท 8 blue tulips/row = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n\n3. To find the number of rows of yellow tulips Jackson will plant, divide the total number of yellow tulips by the number of yellow tulips per row: 30 yellow tulips รท 5 yellow tulips/row = 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n\nHowever, since a row of yellow tulips is planted between every row of red and blue tulips, we must consider how these interjections affect the total number of rows. \n\nGiven the pattern R, Y, B, Y where R is a row of red tulips, Y is a row of yellow tulips, and B is a row of blue tulips, we find complication when comparing the quantity of red rows to blue rows. There are more red rows than blue rows, thus we need to make sure we include enough yellow rows to match the red rows, but not any more that would exceed the number of yellow tulips available.\n\nAdding these numbers together, Jackson will plant a total of 6 red rows + 3 blue rows + 6 yellow rows = 15 rows of tulips."

As explained by Agent Problem Solver, we can calculate the number of rows for each color by dividing the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row. After obtaining the number of rows for each color, we can then add them up to get the total.\n\n```python\n# number of tulips per row for each color\nred_per_row = 6\nblue_per_row = 8\nyellow_per_row = 5\n\n# total number of tulips for each color\ntotal_red = 36\ntotal_blue = 24\ntotal_yellow = 30\n\n# calculate the number of rows for each color\nnum_red_rows = total_red // red_per_row   # using // to get an integer division\nnum_blue_rows = total_blue // blue_per_row\nnum_yellow_rows = total_yellow // yellow_per_row\n\n# total number of rows\ntotal_rows = num_red_rows + num_blue_rows + num_yellow_rows\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nCopying this code into a Python environment will execute it and determine the total number of rows Jackson will plant. Remember to replace `print(total_rows)` with the variable that is being used to hold the results."
