Given that the boys brought back 60 shells each, and the girls brought a number of shells equal to the amount brought by the boys plus 4.5 times the number brought by the boys.\n2. Thus, each girl brought seashells equal to 60(the number of shells brought by the boys) + 4.5 * 60(shells)\n3. We'll calculate the above expression to find the number of seashells brought by each girl. \n\nSo, it is purely an arithmetic calculation based on addition and multiplication.
