For this, we can multiply the number of children by the number of smores each child desires and add that to the product of the number of adults and the number of smores each adult desires.\n\nIn mathematical terms:\n\nTotal smores = (number of children * smores per child) + (number of adults * smores per adult)\n\nThe second step is to figure out how many smores each box of graham crackers can make. A box contains 3 packets and each packet can make 8 smores, so the total number of smores per box is the product of these two.\n\nIn mathematical terms:\n\nSmores per box = packets per box * smores per packet\n\nThe final step is to calculate the number of boxes required. We can divide the total smores by the number of smores per box to get this number. If the result is not a whole number, we need to round up to ensure we have enough boxes. This is because we cannot buy a fraction of a box.\n\nIn mathematical terms:\n\nNumber of boxes = ceil(Total smores / Smores per box)\n\nIf we plug the numbers from the problem into these equations, we can calculate the result."
