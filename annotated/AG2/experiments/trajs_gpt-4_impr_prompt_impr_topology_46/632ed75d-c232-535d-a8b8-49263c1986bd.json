Since the total daily flights of the second aircraft (which are all to Poland) represent half the total flights of the first aircraft, we can multiply 44 by 2 to find the total flights of the first aircraft on a daily basis.\n2. After obtaining the total flights of the first aircraft, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece by multiplying the total flights by three-fourths.\n3. After finding out the flights to Greece, the remaining flights of the first aircraft are equally divided between France and Germany. To get the flights to France, subtract the flights to Greece from the total flights and then divide the result by 2. \n\nThe result obtained at the end of these calculations represents the number of flights made by the first aircraft to France daily."
