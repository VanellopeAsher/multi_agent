There are 6 students playing tennis.\n2. There are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, which means there are 2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball.\n3. There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. The total number of students playing soccer is not explicitly given, so we know there are 22 students playing soccer at least.\n\nTo get the total number of students, we add the number of students in each group which is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 22 (soccer) = 40. So, there are at least 40 students in total. However, as we don't know the exact number of boys playing soccer, there could be more. \n\nWithout information on the number of boys playing soccer, we can't give an exact number but can say that there are at least 40 students in total."
