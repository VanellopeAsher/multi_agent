Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas in total across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. This means that T + W + F = 500.\n\n2. They make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday. This implies that T = W.\n\n3. They make twice as much on Friday as they do on Tuesday. This means that F = 2T.\n\nWe can substitute the equations T = W and F = 2T into the first equation:\n\nT + T + 2T = 500\n4T = 500\n\nFrom there, we can solve for T to get our answer."
