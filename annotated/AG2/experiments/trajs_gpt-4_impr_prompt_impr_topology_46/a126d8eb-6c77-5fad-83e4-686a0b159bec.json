This discount applies to every pair of T-shirts. As a result, the total spent on every two T-shirts is 1.5 times the original price of one T-shirt.\n\nSince Jake buys 20 T-shirts, we understand that he gets this deal ten times.\n\nTherefore, the total spent on T-shirts is:\n\n   number_of_pairs * (1.5* price_of_one_tshirt )\n   \n   \n2. **Calculate how much Jake spends on the shoes**\n\nThe shoes are initially $400, but they are 40% off. The discount for the shoes is:\n\n   price_of_shoes * 0.4\n   \nThe price Jake pays for the shoes is then the original price minus the discount:\n\n   price_of_shoes - discount_on_shoes\n   \n   \n3. **Calculate the total amount Jake spends at the store**\n\nFinally, we sum up the two amounts:\n\n   total_price_on_tshirts + total_price_on_shoes\n"
