The remaining amount should be the total price for the pizza boxes she ordered. Then, we divide this amount by the price of each pizza box to find out how many boxes she ordered. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Compute the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples: $12 + (5 * $3.5) + (4 * $1.50)\n2. Subtract this from the total amount Marie paid: $52.5 - result from step 1\n3. Lastly, divide the result from step 2 by the cost of one pizza box: result from step 2 / $8.50\nThe result after these computations will be the number of pizza boxes she ordered."
