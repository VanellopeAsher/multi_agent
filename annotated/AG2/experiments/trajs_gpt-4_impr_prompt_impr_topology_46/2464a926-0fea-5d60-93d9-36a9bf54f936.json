Then, we simply subtract the number of balloons that are left after the fight from the total number.\n\nThe steps on how to solve this problem would be:\n\n1. Multiply 10 (number of sets) by 30 (number of balloons per set) to find the total number of balloons prepared.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons left (12) from the total number of balloons prepared. This will give the number of balloons used in the fight. \n\nLet's proceed with it. Let me know what you think."
