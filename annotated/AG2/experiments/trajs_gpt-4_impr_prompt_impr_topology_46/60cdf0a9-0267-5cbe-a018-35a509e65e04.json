She got 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box to get the total crayons: total crayons = 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box.\n\nSince she mixed 8 crayon pieces to make a single crayon muffin, divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayon pieces in a muffin to find the total number of muffins: total muffins = total crayons / 8 crayons/muffin.\n\nThen, divide the total amount of money she made by the total number of crayon muffins to determine the price of each crayon muffin: price/muffin = total money / total muffins. \n\nThis will calculate the price for each crayon muffin."
