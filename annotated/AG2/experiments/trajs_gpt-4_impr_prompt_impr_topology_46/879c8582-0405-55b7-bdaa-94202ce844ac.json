Add the total number of basketball cards, baseball cards, and the rare soccer cards to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has initially.\n\n4. Deduct the number of cards she keeps (50) from the total to find out the number of cards given to her students.\n\n5. Divide the number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student receives (10) to find out the number of students Miss Maria has. \n\nLet's proceed to execute these steps."

Calculated the total number of basketball cards, which is 6 decks times 25 cards in each deck gives 150 basketball cards.\n2. Calculated the total number of baseball cards, where 5 boxes times 40 cards in each box giving 200 baseball cards.\n3. Total number of cards initially Maris has is 150 (basketball cards) + 200 (baseball cards) + 30 (soccer cards) equals to 380.\n4. She keeps 50 cards for herself, so 380 - 50 equals 330 cards given to students.\n5. Given that each student gets 10 cards, 330 cards divided by 10 equals to 33 students.\n\nThe solution is therefore 33 students, which matches the code result from Agent Code Executor.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{33}**"
