From the problem, we know that the number of students who do not have desktop computers represents one-third of the total student population.\n2. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'.\n3. So, the problem translates to 1/3 * x = 30\n4. We can solve for 'x' by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3.\n5. After that operation, we find that 'x' equals to 90, meaning there are 90 students in that grade level."

Therefore, to get the total number of students, they multiplied the known one-third (30 students) by 3, yielding a total of 90 students.\n\nI can confirm that the solution and the Python execution are correct. The total number of students at that grade level is indeed 90. Excellent work, everyone."
