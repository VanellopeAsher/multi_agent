So Cookie Monster has:\n\n```python\n# Max has 1.2 times ten more cookies than Cookie Monster\ncookie_monster = (max - 1.2 * 10) / 1.2\n```\n\nAlso, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.\n\n```python\n# Summer has 23 more cookies than Max\nsummer = max + 23\n```\n\nFinally, adding up all the cookies will give us the total number of cookies.\n\n```python\n# Total number of cookies\ntotal = katarina + max + cookie_monster + summer\nprint(total)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the result. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Agent Code Executor's solution output:\n    - Total: 287.83 cookies\n\nLooking at the calculation done by these two agents, the difference was in calculation of the Cookie Monster's cookies. Agent Problem Solver assumed, \"Max has 1.2 times of 10 more cookies than the Cookie Monster\" implies subtracting 10 cookies from Max's cookies, then dividing by 1.2 to get the Cookie Monster's cookies, whereas, Agent Code Executor subtracted \"1.2 times of ten\" cookies from Max's cookies, then divided by 1.2. \n\nAccording to the problem statement's wording, the interpretation of Agent Code Executor seems to be more accurate. Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is approximately 288, considering we cannot have a fraction of a cookie. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 288"
