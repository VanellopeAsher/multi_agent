Determine the number of bucks: Multiply the total deer population by the percentage of deer that are bucks.\n2. Determine the number of 6-point bucks: Multiply the number of bucks by the percentage of bucks that are 6 points.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. The number of bucks is 30% of 80, which is 0.30 * 80 = 24.\n2. The number of 6-point bucks is 50% of 24 (the number of bucks), which is 0.50 * 24 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 six-point bucks in the field."

It should be 12 as we've already calculated. \nWe're casting the result to an integer because we can't have a fraction of a deer."
