Subtract the total cost from the total sales to find the profit.\n \nLet's go step by step.\n\nStep 1:  \n    Cost of passion fruit for one jar: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12  \n    Cost of jackfruit for one jar: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12  \n    Cost of honey for one jar: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20  \n    So, the total cost of ingredients to prepare one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44  \n\nStep 2:\n    The total cost of ingredients to make 10 jars = $44/jar * 10 jars = $440\n\nStep 3: \n    The total selling price for 10 jars = $50/jar * 10 jars = $500\n\nStep 4:\n    The profit from selling 10 jars = Total selling price - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60\n    \nHence, Tim earns a profit of $60 from selling 10 jars of this blend."
