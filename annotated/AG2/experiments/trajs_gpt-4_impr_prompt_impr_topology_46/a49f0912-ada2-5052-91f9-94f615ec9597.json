This is equal to 30*20 = 600 hours. However, this represents only 30% of his total vacation time. So, the total time he spent on vacation is 600/0.30 = 2000 hours.\n\n2. We're asked to find out how much time he spent sightseeing. We know that he spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. So, the time he spent sightseeing is 2000*0.40 = 800 hours.\n\nTherefore, John spent 800 hours sightseeing."

Then the time he spent sightseeing is calculated as 40% of the total time found in step 1. So, we multiply the total time by 0.40. \n\nLet's get into code."
