However, on Monday, the teacher had to conduct an extra class for his students who needed additional help. As a result, he ended up using 45% of the chalk, which was 1.5 times more than his usual consumption. He also noticed that the chalk weighed 0.5 ounces, but this didn't affect his usage. Given that the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches and he plans to return to his usual 20% usage per day, how many days does he have before he needs to recycle this piece of chalk?",

So, we subtract this from the initial size of the chalk:\n     Remaining chalk = Initial chalk - Percentage used * Initial chalk \n     \n2. Check how much chalk can be used for teaching. The teacher can't use chalk smaller than 2 inches. We know that he uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, we need to find out, after what amount of usage, the chalk will reach 2 inches. This gives us the usable amount of chalk:\n    Usable chalk = Remaining chalk - Minimum usable size \n    \n3. Calculate the number of days the chalk will last. We know the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, we divide the usable amount of chalk by the daily chalk usage to get the number of days:\n    Number of days = Usable chalk / (Daily usage * Initial chalk size)\n    \nFollowing this, round down the number of days because the teacher can't use a fraction of a day."

Then, from Tuesday onwards, he planned to return to his usual consumption of 20% per day. However, he cannot use the piece of chalk once it reduces to 2 inches. Hence, he only has (5*0.55 - 2) inches of chalk left to use. Given that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, he can use this piece of chalk for a further 6 days before it becomes smaller than 2 inches and needs to be recycled.
