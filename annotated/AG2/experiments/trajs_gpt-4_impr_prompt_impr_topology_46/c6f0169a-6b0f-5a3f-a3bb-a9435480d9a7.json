The total number of cars is given as 20. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual.\n2. The remainder (20 - 12 - 4 = 4) cars are semi-automatic.\n3. It is given that 3 automatic cars are rented out, and 2 manual cars are under maintenance; therefore, the numbers of available automatic and manual cars are 9 and 2, respectively.\n4. Adding these to the 4 available semi-automatic cars gives a total of 15 available cars.\n5. The fraction of the available semi-automatic cars, therefore, is 4 / 15 = 0.2667, which equates to approximately 26.67% when expressed as a percentage.\n\nThus, the solution obtained is consistent with the given problem conditions and the solution strategy.
