Determine the time Meredith spent on articles on Monday and Tuesday: Each article needs 4 hours to write, so on Monday she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours, and on Tuesday she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of hours Meredith wrote on Monday and Tuesday, then subtract it from the total amount of time she wrote in the three days (104 hrs) to find out how many hours she wrote on Wednesday.\n\n4. Since each article requires an average of 4 hours of writing, divide the number of hours Meredith wrote on Wednesday by 4 to find the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday.\n\n5.
