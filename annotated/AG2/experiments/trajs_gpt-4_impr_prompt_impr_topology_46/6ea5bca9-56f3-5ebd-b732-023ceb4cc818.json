From the given problem we know this total amount is composed of cards from Becca, Smendrick, and PJ\n\n2. Let the number of cards PJ has be x.\n\n3. It's stated that Smendrick has 3 times the amount that PJ has, therefore Smendrick has 3x cards.\n\n4. Becca has 0.12 hundred more than Smendrick, therefore Becca has 3x + 12 cards. The 0.12 hundred was converted to 12 to make calculations easier.\n\n5. Now we know that the total number of cards (341) is the sum of Becca's, Smendrick's, and PJ's cards. This can be expressed as:\n\n   341 = x + 3x + (3x + 12)\n\n6. Solving this will give us the values of x which represents the number of cards each person have.\n\nThat's how I would approach this problem. Now, it's time for Agent_Code_Executor to provide the code for the solution."
