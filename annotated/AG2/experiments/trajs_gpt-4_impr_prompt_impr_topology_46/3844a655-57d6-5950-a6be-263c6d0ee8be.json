Formulate the cost equation for the first venue: The first venue charges a flat fee of $2000, but food is not included and Mark estimates that it costs $50 per person. Therefore, the total cost of hosting the party at this venue can be represented as c1 = 2000 + 50n, where n is the number of guests.\n\n2. Formulate the cost equation for the second venue: The second venue charges $250 per person, and this fee includes the cost of food as well. Therefore, the total cost of hosting the party at this venue can be represented as c2 = 250n.\n\n3. Set the two equations equal to each other to find the number of guests, n, at which the two venues would cost the same: 2000 + 50n = 250n\n\n4. Solve the above equation for n.\n\n5. Finally, the calculated number of guests, n, would be the minimum number of guests necessary for the cost of the two venues to be the same. Open fractions and decimals should be rounded up, as the number of guests should always be an integer."
