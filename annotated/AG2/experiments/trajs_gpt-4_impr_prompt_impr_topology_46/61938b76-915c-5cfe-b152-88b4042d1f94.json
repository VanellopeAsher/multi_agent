He buys 10 packages of biscuits, and each package contains 6 biscuits; therefore, in total, he purchases 10 * 6 = 60 biscuits.\n2. Next, we determine the total cost of these biscuits. If each biscuit is priced at $0.10, the total cost will be 60 * $0.10 = $6.00.\n3. Lastly, we compute Carl's change by subtracting the total cost of the biscuits from the amount of money he handed over, which was a $10 note. Hence the change will be $10 - $6 = $4. \n\nSo, Carl will get $4 in change."
