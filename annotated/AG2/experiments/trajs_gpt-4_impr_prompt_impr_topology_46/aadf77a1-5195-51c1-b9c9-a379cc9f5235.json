This is done by multiplying the area of one medium t-shirt by the number of medium t-shirts used.\n2. Determine the total area of the large shirts used. This is done by multiplying the area of one large t-shirt by the number of large shirts used.\n3. Subtract the total areas of the medium and large shirts (calculated from steps 1 and 2) from the total area of the quilt. This will give us the area covered by small shirts.\n4. Finally, determine the number of small shirts used by dividing the area covered by small shirts (from step 3) by the area of one small shirt. \n\nUsing the information given in the problem:\n\n1. The total area of the medium shirts is 8 medium shirts * 4 square feet/medium shirt = 32 square feet.\n2. The total area of the large shirts is 6 large shirts * 6 square feet/large shirt = 36 square feet.\n3. The area covered by small shirts is 101 square feet (total area of quilt) - 32 square feet (total area of medium shirts) - 36 square feet (total area of large shirts) = 33 square feet.\n4. The number of small shirts used is 33 square feet / 3 square feet/small shirt = 11 small shirts.\n\nTherefore, she used 11 small shirts to make the quilt."
