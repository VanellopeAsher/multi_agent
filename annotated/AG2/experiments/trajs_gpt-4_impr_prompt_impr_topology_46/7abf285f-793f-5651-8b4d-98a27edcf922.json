First, we need to sum up the minimum payments for all the debts, which are the student loan, credit card, and mortgage: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate 50% more than the minimum of the total debt: $1000 * 50% = $500. \n\n3. To get the actual monthly payment, we add the additional 50% to the minimum monthly total: $1000 + $500 = $1500.\n\n4. Finally, for an annual amount, we multiply this monthly total by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.\n\nThis means Jessica pays $18,000 a year, taking into account a 50% increment on her debt payments.\n\nNote: The subscriptions have their costs offset or unchanged, and therefore, don't factor into the debt calculations as we're only adding the extra 50% payment to the debts, not the subscriptions."

It first defines the minimum payments for the student loan, credit card, and mortgage. \n2. It then calculates the total minimum payment by summing up these amounts. \n3. After that, it calculates the amount that is 50% more than this total. \n4. It then adds this extra amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly total. \n5. Finally, it computes the total annual payment by multiplying this monthly total by 12. \n6. It then prints the result, representing the total amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year.
