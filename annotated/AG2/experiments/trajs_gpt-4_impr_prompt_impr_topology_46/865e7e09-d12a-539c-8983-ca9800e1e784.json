Therefore, they received (1/4)*32 liters each. Since there were two girls, they received 2*(1/4)*32 liters in total.\n\n2. It's stated that a boy received 8 liters of water.\n\n3. To find out how much water is left, we'll subtract the combined amount of water the girls and the boy received from the initial 32 liters.\n\n4. The final solution will be 32 liters - [2*(1/4)*32 liters + 8 liters].\n\nLet's calculate this out."
