Kyle took away 6, leaving Griffin with (30 - 6) = 24 fries.\n3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 6 = 12 fries. This leaves Griffin with (24 - 12) = 12 fries.\n4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 6 - 3 = 3 fries. After Colby, Griffin is left with (12 - 3) = 9 fries.\n5. In the end, Griffin had 33 fries. So it means, Ginger must have given Griffin (33 - 9) = 24 fries. \n\nSo, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries."
