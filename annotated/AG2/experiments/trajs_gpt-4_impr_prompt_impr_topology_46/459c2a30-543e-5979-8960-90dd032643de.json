The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares, which means that it contains 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18 blue squares.\n\n3. There are 6 more green squares than blue squares so, the comforter has 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24 green squares.\n\nThe total number of red, blue, and green squares = 14 (red squares) + 18 (blue squares) + 24 (green squares) = 56 squares.\n\nFrom the problem, we know Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet. Thus, the number of white squares is derived from subtracting the total number of red, blue, and green squares from the total size of the comforter:\n\nThe number of White Squares = Total squares of the comforter - Total of red, blue, and green squares = 68 - 56 = 12.\n\nFinally, we can determine how much fewer the white squares are than the green squares by subtracting the number of white squares from the number of green squares:\n\nFewer white squares than green = Green squares - White squares = 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nSo, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares."
