During his recovery, he regained weight for 2 months at the rate of 5 pounds per month. So the total weight he regained is 2*5 = 10 pounds.\n3. So the total weight change over the 5 months is -30 + 10 = -20 pounds. This means Mark lost 20 pounds in total.\n4. His final weight after recovery was 70 pounds. Since this is after a net loss of 20 pounds, his initial weight before he fell ill was 70 + 20 = 90 pounds. \n\nSo Mark's initial weight was 90 pounds."
