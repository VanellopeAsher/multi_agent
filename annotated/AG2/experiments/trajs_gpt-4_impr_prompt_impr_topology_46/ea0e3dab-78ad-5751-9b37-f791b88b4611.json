We know that Aleena paid $200 per month.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. For the first half of the year, which is 6 months, she would have paid $200 * 6 = $1200.\n2. For the second half of the year, she pays 15% less per month. So, first, we calculate the discounted rate: $200 * 15% = $30. Hence, for the second half, she pays $200 - $30 = $170 per month.\n3. Hence, for the second half of the year, she would have paid $170 * 6 = $1020.\n4. Finally, to find the total amount for the year, we add the amounts from the first half and second half of the year: $1200 + $1020 = $2220. \n\nSo, Aleena should have paid a total of $2220 by the end of the year for the streaming service."

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the complete total.\n\nLet's go ahead and code this in Python."
