Find out the price at the pump: $3.00 per gallon, which means that it'll be `10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00`.\n3. Apply the cashback from the app company: $0.20 per gallon, which means `10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00`. Subtract this from the price from the pump: `$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00`.\n4. Apply the coupon discount: 10% of the price after cashback. Find 10% of $28.00 which is `10/100 * $28.00 = $2.80`. Subtract this from the price after the cashback: `$28.00 - $2.80 = $25.20`.\n5. So, they will pay $25.20 for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon. \n\nNow, let's discuss this with the team."
