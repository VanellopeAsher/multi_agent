Compute the total cost for one ballpen, which costs $0.5.\n3. To find out the cost of the pencil case, first compute the cost of one notebook and two ballpens. After that, multiply it by two as the pencil case costs twice as much as one notebook and two ballpens.\n4. The total cost of the items William bought would be the sum of the costs computed in steps 1, 2, and 3."
