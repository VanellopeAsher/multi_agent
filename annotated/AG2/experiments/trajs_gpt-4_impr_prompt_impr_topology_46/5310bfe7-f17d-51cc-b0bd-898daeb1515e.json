Since Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark, we can figure out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 30 from Richie's score. So Mark scored 90 - 30 = 60 goals\n3. Similarly, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 55 from Richie's score, since Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna. As a result, Anna scored 90 - 55 = 35 goals\n4. To find out the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we simply add the number of goals each teenager scored. Which means the total goals will be: 90 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 185 goals \n\nSo, it can be concluded that the three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."

Summing up all these values, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 90 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 185 goals. \n\nTherefore, the final solution is: \n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{185}**."
