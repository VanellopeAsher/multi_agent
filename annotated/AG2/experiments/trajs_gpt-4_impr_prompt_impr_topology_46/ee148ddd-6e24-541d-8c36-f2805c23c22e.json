      "content": "1. To approach this problem, we first need to calculate the total time John spent.\n\n2. We know that the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows represents 30% of his total time spent.\n\n3. Boating took 6 hours, while swimming took half the boating time, so 6/2 = 3 hours. \n\n4. Watching shows took 2 hours each and he watched 3 shows, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 hours.\n\n5. Adding all these times together gives us the total time spent on these activities: 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours. However, this is only 30% of the total time.\n\n6. If 15 hours represents 30% of the total time, we can find the total time by dividing 15 by 30 and multiplying by 100: (15 / 30) * 100 = 50 hours. This represents the total time spent on activities, apart from breaks and lunch time.\n\n7. Now, we know that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. We can find this time by multiplying the total time by 40%: 50 * 0.40 = 20 hours. \n\nSo, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."

So the time he spent sightseeing is 40% of the total time or 50 * 0.40 = 20 hours.\n\nLet's compute all these in python code."
