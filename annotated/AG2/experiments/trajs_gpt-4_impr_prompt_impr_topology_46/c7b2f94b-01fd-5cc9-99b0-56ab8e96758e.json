      "content": "Let's break down the problem. \n\nJoanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. That totals to 30 + 15 + 350 = 395 apples. \n\nJoanne's sister gathered twice the amount of apples that Joanne gathered from the tallest trees, which amounts to 2 * 30 = 60 apples. \n\nAccording to the problem, both sisters together gathered 500 apples. Therefore, the number of apples that Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees is 500 - 395 - 60 = 45 apples.\n\nThe question asks how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees. Since Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees and her sister gathered 45, we can say that Joanne's sister gathered 45/15 = 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne did."

      "content": "The first step in solving this problem is to calculate the total number of apples that Joanne gathered, which can be obtained by summing up the apples she got from the tallest trees, the shortest trees, and the average trees. \nNext, we find out the number of apples that Joanne's sister got from the tallest trees. According to the problem, this number is twice the amount that Joanne got from the tallest trees.\nWe then find out the total number of apples that both sisters gathered. Subtracted from this the total number of apples that Joanne gathered, and the apples got by Joanne's sister from the tallest trees. This gives us the amount of apples that Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees.\nFinally, we divide the number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister from the shortest trees by the number Joanne got from the shortest trees to find out how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees.\nLet's translate this into Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of apples Joanne gathered\njoanne_apples_tallest = 30\njoanne_apples_shortest = joanne_apples_tallest / 2\njoanne_apples_average = 350\njoanne_total_apples = joanne_apples_tallest + joanne_apples_shortest + joanne_apples_average\n\n# Calculate number of apples Joanne's sister got from tallest trees\nsister_apples_tallest = 2 * joanne_apples_tallest\n\n# Calculate the total number of apples both sisters gathered\ntotal_apples = 500\n\n# Calculate number of apples Joanne's sister got from shortest trees\nsister_apples_shortest = total_apples - joanne_total_apples - sister_apples_tallest\n\n# Calculate how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees\ntimes = sister_apples_shortest / joanne_apples_shortest\n\nprint(times)\n```\n\nExecute this block of code to find the result."
