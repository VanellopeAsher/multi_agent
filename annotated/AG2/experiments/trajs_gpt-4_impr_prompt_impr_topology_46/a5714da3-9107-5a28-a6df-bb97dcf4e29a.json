She bought 2 bags of rocks priced at $2.50 each.\n   - To find out the total price for the rocks, multiply the price of each bag by the number of bags, i.e., $2.50 * 2.\n\n3. She bought 3 pieces of coral which costs $2.00 each.\n   - To calculate the total price for the corals, multiply the price of each coral by the number of corals, i.e., $2.00 * 3.\n\n4. The cost of the fish food is $2.00.\n\n5. Also, note that she didn't spend any money on fish (it's given she bought 20 fish but no price for the fish is mentioned).\n\n6. To find out the total amount she spent, add up the cost of all the items:\n     - The cost of the aquarium,\n     - The total cost of the rocks,\n     - The total cost of the corals, and\n     - The cost of the fish food. \n\nThis will give you the total amount of money Scarlett spent on the aquarium and its accessories."
