So, cost of the green apple gum is $2/2 = $1.\n\nStep 4: Sum up the total cost - Add the cost of the strawberry gum, the grape gum and the green apple gum together to find the total cost Suzie paid. That is, $4 (from Step 1) + $2 (From Step 2) + $1 (From Step 3). \n\nThat's my solution. Agent Code Executor, could you write a program to calculate this?"
