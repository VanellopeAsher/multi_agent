Compute the age for the sisters: If all sisters have the same age and that age is 1.6 times of 10, then each sister's age is 1.6 * 10 = 16 years.\n\n2. Compute the total age for the sisters: Since there are 3 sisters with the same age, the total age of sisters would be 3 * 16 = 48 years.\n\n3. Compute the age for the younger brother: One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old. So, the younger brother's age is = 3/5 * 20 = 12 years.\n\n4. Compute the age for the older brother: The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother. So, the older brother's age is 2 * 12 = 24 years.\n\n5. Finally, compute the total age of all siblings: The total age would be the sum of all the individualâ€™s age. Therefore, their total age would be: Age of sisters + Age of younger brother + Age of older brother = 48 years (sisters) + 12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother) = 84 years. \n\nSo, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."

Multiply the age obtained in step 1 by the number of sisters (3) to obtain the total age of the sisters.\n3. Calculate the age of one brother from the statement that his age is \"3/5 of 20 years old\". This will be done by multiplying 3/5 by 20.\n4. Compute the age of the second brother from the statement that his age is \"half the age of the older brother\". The younger brother's age will be multiplied by 2 to get the age of the older brother.\n5.
