Determine the total number of calories that need to be burnt for Andy to lose the expected weight. We do this by multiplying the total weight to be lost (in pounds) by the number of calories that need to be burnt to lose a pound. \n\n3. Calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the expected weight. We'd determine the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.\n\n4. Once we have the total calories to be burnt and the total number of days, we can then calculate the net amount of calories Andy needs to burn each day. We do this by dividing the total calories by the total number of days. \n\nNow, let's do the calculations."
