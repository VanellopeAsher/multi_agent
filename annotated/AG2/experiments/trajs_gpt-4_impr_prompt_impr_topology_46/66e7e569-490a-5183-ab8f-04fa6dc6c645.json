      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a simple proportion setup by first identifying the known ratios and then setting them equal to the unknowns. \n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Identify ratio/proportion: We know from the problem that 60 potatoes can make 360 hash browns. This means the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 60 to 360 or, simplistically, 1 to 6. \n\n2. Setup the proportion: You want to find out how many hash browns you can make out of 960 potatoes. So, let's say this unknown number of hash browns is 'x'. The proportion can be set up as:\n                      60/360 = 960/x \n\n3. Cross-multiply and solve for 'x': After cross-multiplying you will get: \n                      60x = 360 * 960, \n   Solving for 'x' gives: \n                     x = (360 * 960) / 60 \n\n4. Find the number of hash browns: The calculated 'x' will determine the number of hash browns that can be made out of 960 potatoes.\n   \nThis method will help you calculate the number of hash browns you can produce given a certain quantity of potatoes."
