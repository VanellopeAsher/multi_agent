From this, we calculate the total number of muffins Kate can make by dividing the total crayon fragments by the number of fragments required per muffin (8). Lastly, we multiply the total muffins by the price per muffin to find out the total amount that Kate can earn.\n\nHere's the code for that.\n\n```python\n# Number of crayon containers\ncontainers = 3\n\n# Number of crayons per container\ncrayons_per_container = 64\n\n# Total crayons\ntotal_crayons = containers * crayons_per_container\n\n# Fragments per muffin\nfragments_per_muffin = 8\n\n# Total muffins\ntotal_muffins = total_crayons / fragments_per_muffin\n\n# Price per muffin\nprice_per_muffin = 1.5\n\n# Total amount Kate can earn\namount = total_muffins * price_per_muffin\n\nprint(amount)\n```\n\nLet's run this code now."

Given that 8 such fragments were needed to make a crayon muffin, she could make 192/8 = 24 crayon muffins.\n3.
