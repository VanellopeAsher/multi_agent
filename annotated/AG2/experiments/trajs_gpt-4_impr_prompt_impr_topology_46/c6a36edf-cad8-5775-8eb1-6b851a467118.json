Lastly, we multiply the total muffins by the price per muffin to find out the total amount that Kate can earn.\n\nHere's the code for that.\n\n```python\n# Number of crayon containers\ncontainers = 3\n\n# Number of crayons per container\ncrayons_per_container = 64\n\n# Total crayons\ntotal_crayons = containers * crayons_per_container\n\n# Fragments per muffin\nfragments_per_muffin = 8\n\n# Total muffins\ntotal_muffins = total_crayons / fragments_per_muffin\n\n# Price per muffin\nprice_per_muffin = 1.5\n\n# Total amount Kate can earn\namount = total_muffins * price_per_muffin\n\nprint(amount)\n```\n\nLet's run this code now."

Given that 8 such fragments were needed to make a crayon muffin, she could make 192/8 = 24 crayon muffins.\n3.
