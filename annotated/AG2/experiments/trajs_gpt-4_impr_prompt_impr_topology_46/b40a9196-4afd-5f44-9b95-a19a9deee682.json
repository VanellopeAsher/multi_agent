Then, sum the cost of all items, applying the tax where necessary. \n\nHere's how I propose to solve this problem:\n1. Clearly identify the items that are considered food, which the tax doesn't apply to. Given common knowledge, let's say milk and eggs are food items.\n2. Sum up the costs of all items. For each non-food item, add its cost plus an additional 10%.\n3. The total cost of the items is the result from step 2. \n\nLet's go step by step:\n\na. Milk and eggs are the food items. Their total cost is 2 (for milk) plus 3 (for eggs) = 5 dollars. \n\nb. The non-food items are the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. Their total cost is 3 (for the light bulbs) plus 3 (for the cups) plus 4 (for the roach traps) = 10 dollars. \n\nc. The 10% tax for the non-food items costs 10 (their total cost) times 10/100 = 1 dollar. \n\nd. The total cost for all the items will therefore be 5 (for the food items from (a) ) plus 10 (for the non-food items from (b) ) plus 1 (the tax from (c) ) = 16 dollars. \n\nSo, the total cost of all items, considering the tax for non-food items, is 16 dollars."
