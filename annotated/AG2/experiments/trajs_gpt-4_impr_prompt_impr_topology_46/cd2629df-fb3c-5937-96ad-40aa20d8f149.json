Then, open a new Python file in your preferred code editor (IDLE, PyCharm, VSCode, etc.). \n\n3. Copy the Python code provided in the previous response and paste it into the new Python file.\n\n4.

The principle amount that Stephen borrowed is $300, and the interest rate is 2%.\n   \n   The formula to calculate the amount with interest is: principle_amount + principle_amount * interest_rate\n   So, you get: 300 + 300 * 0.02 = 306\n\n2. Calculate how much Stephen has already paid his sister in the first 11 months. Since he pays $25 per month, the total amount he has paid in the first 11 months will be 11 * 25 = 275\n   \n3. Finally, calculate the amount that Stephen will pay his sister in the 12th month, excluding his coin purchases. This will be the total amount owed minus what he has already paid.
