Calculate the total cost for jacket and shoes: The cost of the jacket is $120, and the cost of 2 pairs of shoes, at $100 per pair, is $200. Therefore, the total cost is $120 + $200 = $320.\n\n2. Calculate the total earnings from babysitting: Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, each time earning $5. Therefore, from babysitting, she earns a total of 10 * $5 = $50.\n\n3. Calculate the remaining amount she needs to earn by mowing the lawn: Since Sara already had $100 saved and earned $50 from babysitting, she has a total of $100 + $50 = $150. To buy the things she wants, she still needs an extra $320 - $150 = $170.\n\n4. Determine how many times she must mow the lawn: As Sara earns $10 for each time she mows the lawn, she will need to mow the lawn $170 / $10 = 17 times to be able to buy the jacket and shoes. \n\nSo, Sara must mow the lawn 17 times."

Therefore, she still needs $170 to reach her goal after babysitting.\n4. Since she earns $10 mowing the lawn each time, she will have to do this 17 times to earn the remaining necessary funds.\n\nThus, the number of times Sara will need to mow the lawn will be 17.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\n\n# Constants\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost = 100\nnumber_of_shoes = 2\nbabysitting_pay = 5\nnumber_of_babysittings = 10\nlawn_mowing_pay = 10\ninitial_savings = 100\n\n# Total costs\nshoes_costs = shoe_cost * number_of_shoes\ntotal_costs = jacket_cost + shoes_costs\n\n# Total earning from babysitting\nbabysitting_earnings = babysitting_pay * number_of_babysittings\n\n# Calculate remaining balance after babysitting\nremaining_balance = total_costs - (babysitting_earnings + initial_savings)\n\n# Calculate how many times she need to mow lawn\ntimes_to_mow_lawn = remaining_balance / lawn_mowing_pay\n\nprint(times_to_mow_lawn)\n\n```\nI can execute this code now, if desired. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
