Divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball, which is 25 cents.\n\nThe result will give the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, assuming he can only buy whole gumballs, not parts of them. So, we will use the integer division (floor division) operator, which discards the remainder and only returns the integer part of the quotient.
