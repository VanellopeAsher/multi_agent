Half of this is 6 pints spent on yellow paint.\n\nStep 4: We are left with 6 pints of paint that were used for the red, white, and purple paint.\n\nStep 5: Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the available 6 pints equally among these three colors. This gives us a total of 6 / 3 = 2 pints.\n\nSo, 2 pints of the paint was used for the red color.\n"

Let's check it with code execution now."
