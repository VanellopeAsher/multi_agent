Find the protein content in 300 grams of mushrooms: Since 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein, 300 grams will contain double the amount of protein, which is 8 grams.\n2. Calculate the protein intake per week: Since John consumes 300 grams of mushrooms daily, he consumes 8 grams of protein every day. Over a week (7 days), he would consume 8 grams/day * 7 days = 56 grams of protein. \n\nSo, John gets 56 grams of protein from mushrooms per week."
