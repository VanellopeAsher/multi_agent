We know that she uses 3 eggs per day for her omelet, so to find out how many eggs she consumes for 7 days we multiply 3 by 7. \n\n2. We then take that weekly consumption and multiply it by 12 to find out how many eggs she will consume for 12 weeks.\n\n3. To convert eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 because a dozen is defined as twelve of something.\n\n4. Apply the math: First, calculate the total number of eggs consumed daily, then convert to weeks, and finally convert to dozens.\n\n5. We should end up with a numeric answer representing the dozens of eggs Claire will consume over 12 weeks. \n\nLet's execute these steps."
