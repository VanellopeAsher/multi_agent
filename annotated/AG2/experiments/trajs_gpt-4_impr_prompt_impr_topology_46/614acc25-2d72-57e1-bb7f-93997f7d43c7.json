Here, \"c\" represents the number of cougars Rick killed on the first day. Without the exact value of \"c\", we cannot calculate a definitive number of total animals killed. Further information would be needed to pinpoint this number. \n\nThe final formula indicates that, for each cougar Rick killed on the first day, he would kill five animals in total across the two days (4 on the first day from wolves and the cougar itself, and another wolf on the second day), with an additional reduction of two animals which represents the reduction in the number of cougars on the second day.\n\nIn conclusion, we need the exact number of cougars Rick killed on the first day for an exact answer.

This offset is because Rick killed three fewer cougars in the second day than the first day.\n\nAgain, we would need the exact number of cougars killed by Rick on the first night (which the problem doesn't tell us) to calculate the total number of animals that Rick killed. \n\nMeanwhile, the formula \"5*c - 2\" gives us a precise mathematical relationship among these quantities depending on the number of cougars killed on the first night."
