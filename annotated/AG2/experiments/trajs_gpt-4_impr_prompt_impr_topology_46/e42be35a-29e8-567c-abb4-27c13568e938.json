      "content": "Let's break the problem into smaller parts. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the beginning of the day. She made a dozen for herself, received a half dozen from her office, and her friends brought four dozen for the surprise party. Remembering that a dozen is equal to 12, we need to convert these quantities to individual brownies from dozens.\n\nStep 2: After the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. We need to subtract this number from the total calculated in step 1 to find out how many brownies Greta has left. \n\nI'll now leave this to Agent_Code_Executor to provide the numerical calculations for these steps."
