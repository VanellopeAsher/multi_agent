      "content": "Here's how I would approach solving this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to find out the total number of boxes that Mrs. Harrington bought. We know that she gave away 4 boxes (2 each to her mom and sister) and kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. But since we don't know the total number, let the total number of boxes she bought be X.\n\n2. We know that each box contains 20 oranges, therefore the total number of oranges that she bought is 20 * X.\n\n3. Out of these, she gave away 4 boxes which means she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges. \n\n4. Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges for herself. \n\n5. The number of oranges left after she gave away some to her mom and sister is 20X - 80. \n\n6. She keeps 1/4 of that which means she keeps (1/4) * (20X - 80) oranges, \n\n7. She sells the rest of the oranges which means she sells (20X - 80) - (1/4) * (20X - 80) oranges.\n\nFrom the problem, we know how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, and from there, we can find the value of X, the number of boxes she bought. However, the problem doesn't provide this number (how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold), so I believe there may be some missing information."
