At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad: Meaning Emil's dad will be 26 * 2 = 52 years old. However, that is in 5 years time. To find his dad's current age, we subtract 5 years from 52 which gives us 47 years.\n3. Similarly, Emil will be twice as old as his brother in 5 years time. Hence, his brother will be 26 / 2 = 13 years old in 5 years. To get the brother's current age, we subtract 5 from 13 giving us 8 years.\n4. Finally, we find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother which is 47 + 8 = 55 years.\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 55 years."
