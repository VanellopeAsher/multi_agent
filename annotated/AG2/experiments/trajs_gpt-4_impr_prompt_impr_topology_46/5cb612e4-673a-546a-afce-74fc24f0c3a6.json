The profit for the trader after selling one bag would then be $30 - $22 = $8. \n\nConsidering the trader made a total profit of $400, we can create the following equations and solve for \"x\":\n\n$8x = $400\n\nWhich means\n\n\\[\nx = $400/$8 = 50 \\textit{ bags of wheat}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
