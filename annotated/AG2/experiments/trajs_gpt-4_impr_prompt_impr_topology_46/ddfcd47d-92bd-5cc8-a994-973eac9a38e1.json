From this, we can find out how much Kassidy originally has by multiplying 2/3 by the amount of money Aurelia has, which is $150.\n\n3. Also, Rayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy. After we find out how much Kassidy has, we can add 70 to it to find out how much Rayna originally has.\n\n4. We will then add together the amounts Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia originally had to find out the total sum they would have if they pooled their money together.\n\n5. To find out how much each of them will have if they share this sum equally, we divide this total by 3 (since there are three of them).\n\nAfter the above steps, we will have the answer to the problem. However, I will also engage a programming agent to perform the calculations necessary for us."
