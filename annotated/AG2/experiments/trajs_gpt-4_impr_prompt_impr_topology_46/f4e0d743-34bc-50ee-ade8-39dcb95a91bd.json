Since there are typically 4 weeks in a month, this makes a monthly food expense of $25 * 4 = $100.\n- Treats: $20 per month.\n- Medicine: $100 per month.\n- Special Shampoo: $15 per month.\n- Toys: $10 every two months. Since this is a bi-monthly expense, the effective monthly cost for toys is $10/2 = $5.\n\nAdding these up, we get the total monthly cost as follows:\n$100 (Food) + $20 (Treats) + $100 (Medicine) + $15 (Shampoo) + $5 (Toys) = $240.\n\nTo find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12 months), giving us $240 * 12 = $2880.\n\nSo, Madeline spends $2880 on her dog per year."
