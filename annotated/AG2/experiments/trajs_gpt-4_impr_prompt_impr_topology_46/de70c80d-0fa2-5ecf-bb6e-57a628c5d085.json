The agent correctly identifies the composition of the English alphabet and successfully applies this to compute the accurate total number of letters written by Elise through strategic addition and multiplication.\n\nIn parallel, Agent Code Executor code checks the hand-calculated solution from Agent Problem Solver by writing a simple Python script that mirrors the earlier computation steps. The execution of this code returns the same result, which verifies the accuracy of the computations done by Agent Problem Solver.\n\nBased on this evidence, I can confidently determine that Elise has written a total of **182** letters.\n\nHence, SOLUTION_FOUND: **\\boxed{182}**."
