So the total perimeter of the fence would be the sum of the lengths of the four sides.\n\nGiven that the lengths of the long and short sides are 20 feet and 15 feet, respectively, the total length of the fence can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. The total length of the two longer sides would be 2 times the length of one longer side, which is 2*20 = 40 feet.\n\n2. The total length of the two shorter sides would be 2 times the length of one shorter side, which is 2*15 = 30 feet.\n\n3. The total length of the fence would be the sum of the total length of the longer sides and the shorter sides. That is, 40 feet + 30 feet = 70 feet.\n\nSince James does not want to hang any streamers on the tree, we do not have to consider the height of the tree in our calculation.\n\nTherefore, James would need to buy 70 feet of crepe paper for his fence."

The total length of the window (or the perimeter of the rectangle) would be the sum of the lengths of these four sides.\n\nGiven that the lengths of the long and short sides of the window are 6 feet and 4 feet, respectively:\n\n1. The total length of the two longer sides would be 2 times the length of one longer side, which is 2*6 = 12 feet.\n2. The total length of the two shorter sides would be 2 times the length of one shorter side, which is 2*4 = 8 feet.\n3. The total length of the window would be the sum of both, which is 12 feet + 8 feet = 20 feet.\n\nSecond, we need the length that each package of lights covers (5 feet per package). Thus, the total number of packages needed can be determined by dividing the total length by the length that each package of lights covers.\n\nNumber of packages = Total length of window / Length covered by each package = 20 feet / 5 feet/package = 4 packages.\n\nTherefore, Lemagaya needs to buy 4 packages of lights."

The window size is given, and the length of the lights that each package covers is also specified.\n\nSo, first, we would calculate the perimeter of the window using the formula for a perimeter of a rectangle, i.e., P = 2*(length + width). The given length is 6ft, and the width is 4ft.\n\nThen, to calculate the total number of packages needed, we would divide the total window length (the calculated perimeter) by the length each package covers. Since each package covers 5ft, the total number of packages = Perimeter/5.\n\nIf the resulting number of packages is not an integer, Lemagaya has to buy more packages because partial packages are generally not available. Therefore, the number of packages should be rounded up (or use the ceiling function in Python) to the nearest integer. However, in this case, the number of packages is an exact integer, so no rounding is necessary.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# store the length and width of the rectangle\nlength = 6  \nwidth = 4  \n\n# calculate the perimeter using the formula for a rectangle\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width) \n\n# calculate the number of light packages needed\n packages = math.ceil(perimeter / 5)\n\nprint(packages)\n```\nThis Python code will give the total number of packages of lights that Lemagaya needs."
