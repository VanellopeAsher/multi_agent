So, to find the total number of eggs found by the twins, we multiply 30 by 2. \n2. Given that all the remaining eggs except 10 were found by their friends, this implies that the number of eggs found by the friends is the total number of eggs minus the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the remaining 10.\n\nThe above steps give us the solution. However, Agent Code Executor can run these steps correctly to have a concrete solution."
