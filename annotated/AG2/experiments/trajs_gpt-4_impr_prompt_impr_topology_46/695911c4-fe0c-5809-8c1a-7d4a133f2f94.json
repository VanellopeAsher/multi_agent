So the amount spent in this time period will equal to 10 years * 3 visits/year * $10/visit.\n\n2. Next 3 years: The ticket price has increased by 150%, so a ticket now costs $10 + $10 * 150/100. Pauline still goes three times per year, therefore the cost for one year would be 3 visits * new ticket price, and for three years, it would be 3 * cost for one year.\n\nAdding these two amounts together will provide the total money spent by Pauline for all her visits to the museum."

Let's compute the cost for each time period as suggested by Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor:\n\n1. For the first 10 years: The total cost is 10 * 3 * 10 = $300.\n  \n2. For the next 3 years: The ticket price increased by (10 * 150/100) = $15. So, the new ticket price is 10 + 15 = $25. Thus, the total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * 25 * 3 = $225.\n\nBy summing these two values, we get the total cost: 300 + 225 = $525. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{525}"
