The total money made from milkshake sales can be calculated by multiplying the number of milkshakes sold (6) by the price per milkshake ($5.50).\n- Calculate the earnings for the burgers: Terry sold 9 burger platters for $11.5 each. The total earnings for the burgers can be calculated by multiplying the number of burger platters sold (9) by the cost of one burger platter ($11.5).\n- Calculate the earnings for the sodas: Terry sold half of 40 (=20) sodas for $1.50 each. We calculate the total earnings from soda by multiplying the number of sodas sold (20) by the price per soda ($1.50).\n- Finally, add up the total earnings for all the items to get Terry's total earnings."
