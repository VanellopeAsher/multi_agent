Calculate the number of Smart TVs sold: Smart TVs represent one-fourth of sales, so the number sold is 1/4 * the total number of TVs.\n2. Calculate the number of Analog TVs sold: Analog TVs represent one-eighth of sales, so the number sold is 1/8 * the total number of TVs.\n3. Calculate the number of Projection TVs sold: Projection TVs represent one-fifth of sales, so the number sold is 1/5 * the total number of TVs.\n4. Subtract the number of these three types of TVs from the total number of TVs sold to find the number of OLED TVs sold. \n\nLet's apply these steps to the given problem."
