A typical workday lasts 6 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so this equals 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.\n\n2. Determine how many calls Tim can handle in one workday by dividing the total minutes in the workday by the time it takes to deal with one call. This equals 360 / 15 = 24 calls.\n\n3. Compute the number of minutes Tim works on Friday, considering the overtime. Tim works an extra 2 hours on Fridays, so he works 6 + 2 = 8 hours, which equals 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.\n\n4. Determine how many calls Tim can handle on Friday, by dividing the total minutes worked on Friday by the time it takes to deal with one call. This equals 480 / 15 = 32 calls.\n\n5. Compute the total number of calls Tim can handle in a five-day workweek. This equals 24 calls/day * 4 days/week + 32 calls for Friday = 96 + 32 = 128 calls in a week. \n\nSo, during his 5-day workweek, Tim deals with 128 calls."

We calculate the number of minutes Tim works on Friday, considering the overtime. Given Tim works an extra 2 hours on Fridays, that's 8 hours or 8 * 60 minutes.\n\n4. We calculate how many calls can Tim handle on Friday, by dividing the total minutes worked on Friday by the time it takes to deal with one call.\n\n5. Finally, we calculate the total number of calls Tim handles in a five-day workweek. For Monday through Thursday, he handles daily_calls, and on Friday he handles Friday_calls. The total calls he can handle in a week is the sum of these two.\n\nThe python code below accomplishes these steps:\n\n```python\n# Time per workday in minutes\ntime_per_workday = 6 * 60     \n# Time per call in minutes\ntime_per_call = 15            \n# Number of calls per day\ndaily_calls = time_per_workday // time_per_call\n# Extra time on Friday in minutes\nextra_time = 2 * 60          \n# Total time on Friday in minutes\ntotal_time_friday = time_per_workday + extra_time\n# Number of calls on Friday\nfriday_calls = total_time_friday // time_per_call\n# Total calls in a week\ntotal_calls = 4 * daily_calls + friday_calls\n\nprint(total_calls)\n```"
