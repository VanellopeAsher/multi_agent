In this case, $700 per phone * 5 phones = $3500 for the phones total.\n\n2. To find the total purchase, add the cost of the tablet and the headphones to the cost of the phones. As such, $3500 (phones total) + $330 (tablet) + $137 (headphones) = $3967 in total purchase.\n\n3. The difference between what the buyer gave and the total purchase will be the change. Deducting the total purchase from the amount given, we get: $4000 - $3967 = $33 returned to the buyer as change. \n\nSo, the seller has to give back $33 to the buyer in change."
