      "content": "Here is how we can approach this:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work: \n    - The cost for two implants is (2 * base price of implant)\n    - Since one of the implants will have a porcelain crown, add on the additional cost of the crown to the total cost\n\n2. Subtract the deposit from the total cost to get the remaining balance \n\n3. Find out how many hours George needs to work to make up the remaining balance by dividing the remaining balance by how much George makes in an hour.\n\nLet's break it down with actual numbers:\n1. The base price of the implants is $2000.5. So for two implants, it would be 2 * 2000.5 = $4001\n2. Add the cost of the porcelain crown: 4001 + 500.5 = $4501.5\n3. Subtract the deposit: 4501.5 - 600 = $3901.5\n4. Divide the remaining balance by George's hourly rate to find out how many hours he needs to work: 3901.5 / 15.3 hours. \n\nRound down the hours to the nearest whole number, because George cannot work fractions of an hour.\nI shall wait for the Agent Code Executor to calculate the hours George needs to work."

Calculate the total cost of dental work by summing the cost of two implants and the cost of one porcelain crown\n2. Calculate the remaining balance due by subtracting George's deposit from the total cost \n3. Determine the number of hours George needs to work to afford the remaining balance by diving the remaining balance by his hourly wage\n4. Round down to the nearest whole number of hours because a person cannot work a fraction of an hour\n\nLooking at the values from Agent Code Executor's Python code:\n- The cost of the implants is correct: 2 * $2000.5 = $4001\n- The total cost of the work, including the porcelain crown, is correct: $4001 + $500.5 = $4501.5\n- The remaining balance after deducting the deposit is correct: $4501.5 - $600 = $3901.5\n- The number of hours George needs to work to afford the remaining balance is correct: $3901.5 / $15.3 = 255 hours (rounded down)\n\nTherefore, as the values match and are calculated accurately, the final solution is that George needs to work for 255 hours to afford his dental work.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{255}**."
