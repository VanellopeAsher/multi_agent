We know that Carver just turned 60, which according to the problem is 8 years less than twice the age of his son. \n\nThis can be mathematically expressed as: \n\n60 = 2x - 8\n\nTo find `x` (the son's age), we can solve the equation. \n\nFirst, add 8 to both sides of the equation:\n\n60 + 8 = 2x - 8 + 8 \n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n68 = 2x\n\nThen, to solve for `x`, divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = 68 / 2\n\nThis will give us the age of Carver's son. \n\nLet's calculate it."
