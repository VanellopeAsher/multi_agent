Polly can throw the gold javelin a distance of 4,000 feet without the sapphire gemstone.\n3. When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.\n\nTo solve, we follow these steps:       \n\na. We need to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. This is found by multiplying the distance she can throw without the gemstone by 3, since the gemstone triples her throwing distance.\n\nb. Then, we need to find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's fire Polly can stand. This is found by subtracting the dragon's fire range from the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.    \n\nLet's proceed with the calculations."
