The number of doughnuts Derrick's bakery makes daily.\n2. Whether the bakery operates every day in June or takes any days off.\n3. If the bakery operates every day in June, I would then calculate the total number of doughnuts made by multiplying the number of doughnuts made daily by 30 (the number of days in June).\n4. I would then multiply the total number of doughnuts made by the price of each doughnut to determine how much money Derrick makes in June.\n\nWithout these additional details, it is impossible to determine how much money Derrick makes from selling doughnuts in June."
