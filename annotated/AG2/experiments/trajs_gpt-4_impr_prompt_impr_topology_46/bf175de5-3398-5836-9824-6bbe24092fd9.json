Calculate the time a single person would take to paint an entire house.\n2. Divide the result by the number of people in the team to get the number of days required.\n3. Multiply the result by the number of hours in a day to convert the time to hours."

Calculate the time a single person would take to paint the entire house, which equals to 2*5 = 10 days.\n2. Divide the result by the number of people in the team (5), which leaves us with 10/5 = 2 days.\n3. Multiply the result by the number of hours in the day to get the time in hours, so 2*24 = 48 hours.\n\nFollowing these steps, it takes a team of 5 individuals 48 hours to paint an entire house. Hence, taking into consideration the inputs from both agents, I conclude:\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{48}."
