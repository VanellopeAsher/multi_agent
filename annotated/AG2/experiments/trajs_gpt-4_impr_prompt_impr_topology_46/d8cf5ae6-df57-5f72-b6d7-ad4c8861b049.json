  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out the total weight of all feed and then divide that number by the number of trips the farmer has to make.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. We know that sugar cubes weigh 1 pound per box and the farmer bought 2 boxes, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2*1 = 2 pounds.\n\n2. Carrots weigh 12 pounds per bag and the farmer bought 4 bags, so the total weight of carrots is 4*12 = 48 pounds.\n\n3. Hay weighs 75 pounds per bale and the farmer bought 42 bales, so the total weight of hay is 42*75 = 3150 pounds.\n\n4. Oats weigh 65 pounds per sack and the farmer bought 20 sacks, so the total weight of oats is 20*65 = 1300 pounds.\n\n5. To find the total weight of all feed, we add the weights of the individual feeds together: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.\n\n6. We know the farmer needs to transport all the feed in 2 trips, so each trip should carry 4500/2 = 2250 pounds. \n\nSo the farmer's farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time."

Multiply the weight of a unit of each item by the quantity of that item to get the total weight.\n    - Sugar cubes: 2 * 1 (outputs: 2)\n    - Carrots: 4 * 12 (outputs: 48)\n    - Hay: 42 * 75 (outputs: 3150)\n    - Oats: 20 * 65 (outputs: 1300)\n\n2. Sum the total weight of all items, which should equal 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300, giving us a total of 4500 pounds.\n\n3.
