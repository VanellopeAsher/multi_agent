To solve this problem, we will use a basic Algebraic approach since we know prices of each packet, the total amount spent, and the amount of one type of packet.\n\nHere are the steps involved to solve this problem:\n\n1. Let's denote the number of tomato packets with the symbol T.\n2. As we know, she has 80 packets of celery seeds and each costs $30, the total spent on celery seeds is 80 * $30 = $2400.\n3. She spent a total of $3200 for both types of seeds. So the amount she used to buy the tomato seeds packets is $3200 - $2400 = $800.\n4. Since each packet of tomato seeds costs $40, the number of tomato seeds packets (T) she bought is derived from the division of the amount spent on tomato seeds packets by the price of each packet.\n5. Therefore, T = $800/$40.\n\nFinally, calculate the value of T following step 5 above. This will give you the number of tomato seeds packets Mrs. Rylan bought."
