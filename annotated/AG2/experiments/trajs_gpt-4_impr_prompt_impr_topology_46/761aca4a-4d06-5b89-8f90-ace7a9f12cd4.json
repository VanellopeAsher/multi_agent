On Tuesday, the water level increased by an additional 7 feet, so we need to add 17 and 7 to find the Tuesday's water depth.\n3. The problem states that by Wednesday, the water level reduced to two thirds of Tuesday's depth. To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to calculate two thirds of Tuesday's total depth.\n\nLet's do the calculations."
