Distance John runs on the remaining day.\n\nWe know John runs half as much on the remaining day, so to find this value, we would divide the distance of two days by 2.\n\nFor the speed, we need more information such as time. How long does he take to run the miles? As speed is generally calculated as distance/time, without time, we can't get an accurate speed. Can you provide this info?"

The time he spends running is a crucial part of calculating speed because speed is distance divided by time. As such, without this information, it is impossible to accurately calculate John's speed. Could you please provide the time it takes for John to run each week? It would also be helpful to know how the time is allocated across the three days he runs."
