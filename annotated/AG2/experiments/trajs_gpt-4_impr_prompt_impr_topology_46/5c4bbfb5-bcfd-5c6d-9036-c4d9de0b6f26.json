For the chicken, since each pack cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, we need to figure out the price per pack of bacon first. We can calculate this by dividing the total cost of bacon ($10.5) by the number of bacon packs (5). Once we have the price per pack of bacon, we multiply by 2 (since each chicken pack is twice as expensive) and then by 6 to get the total cost for the chicken packs.\n3. The total cost of the strawberries can be found by multiplying the price per pack ($4.5) by the number of packs (3).\n4. For the apples, since each pack is half the price of a strawberries pack, we half the cost of a pack of strawberries ($4.5) and then multiply it by the number of apple packs (7).\n\nFinally, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of all the items from her budget ($65).\n\nWe'll calculate all these steps one by one to get the final answer."

Therefore, each chicken packet costs 2.1 * 2 = $4.2\nSince Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, total cost for chicken is 4.2 * 6 = $25.2\n\n**Step 3**: Calculate the total cost of strawberries.\nThe cost of each packet of strawberries is given as $4.5 and Kelly has 3 packets. Therefore, total cost for strawberries is 4.5 * 3 = $13.5\n\n**Step 4**: Calculate the cost of apples per packet and total cost.\nEach pack of apples is priced half the price of a pack of strawberries. Therefore, each apple packet costs 4.5/2 = $2.25\nSince Kelly has 7 packets of apples, total cost for apples is 2.25 * 7 = $15.75\n\n**Step 5**: Calculate the total cost and how much money Kelly has left.\nThe total cost of all the items is 10.5 (bacon) + 25.2 (chicken) + 13.5 (strawberries) + 15.75 (apples) = $64.95\nSince Kelly's budget is $65, she has 65 - 64.95 = $0.05 left in her budget"
