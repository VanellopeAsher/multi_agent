We need to first convert all coin amounts into the same monetary system, which in this case is nickels, since the price for each gumball is given in nickels.\n2. Given the monetary value of each coin type: 1 quarter = 25 cents, 1 dime = 10 cents, 1 nickel = 5 cents, and 1 penny = 1 cent, we can express these in nickel values: 1 quarter = 5 nickels, 1 dime = 2 nickels, 1 penny = 0.2 nickels.\n3. We multiply the number of each coin type by its equivalent in nickels to obtain the total value for each coin type: quarters in nickels = 80 * 5 = 400, dimes in nickels = 60 * 2 = 120, nickels = 140 * 1 = 140, pennies in nickels = 150 * 0.2 = 30.\n4. We then sum up all the nickel values from each coin type to get a total nickel value: total nickels = 400 + 120 + 140 + 30 = 690.\n5. Lastly, since each gumball costs 1 nickel, the total number of gumballs Colby can buy is equal to the total number of nickels he has, which is 690."
