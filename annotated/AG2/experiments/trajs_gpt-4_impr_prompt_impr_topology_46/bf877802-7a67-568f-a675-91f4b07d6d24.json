For Stage 1, calculate the total degree change using the formula: degree change = rate of movement * duration. In our case, the degree change for the first stage = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.\n2. For Stage 2, do similar calculation of degree change as Stage 1: degree change = rate of movement * duration => 3 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 6 degrees.\n3. Now, adding the two degree changes from Stage 1 and Stage 2 to the initial angle of the pyramids gives us the final position of the sun. So, final position of the sun from the ground = initial position + degree change of Stage 1 + degree change of Stage 2 = 32 degrees + 50 degrees + 6 degrees = 88 degrees.\n\nTherefore, from the ground to the sun, there will be 88 degrees."

For the last 2 hours, it moves at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.\n\nTherefore, the total degrees from the ground to the sun will be the initial 32 degrees plus the total degrees the sun moves.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python. \n\n```python\n# initial degrees of the pyramid\ninitial_degrees = 32\n\n# total hours the sun moves\ntotal_hours = 12\n\n# degrees per hour for the first 10 hours\ndegrees_per_hour_1 = 5\n\n# degrees per hour for the last 2 hours\ndegrees_per_hour_2 = 3\n\n# total degrees the sun moves in the first 10 hours\ndegrees_moved_1 = degrees_per_hour_1 * 10\n\n# total degrees the sun moves in the last 2 hours\ndegrees_moved_2 = degrees_per_hour_2 * 2\n\n# total degrees from the ground to the sun\ntotal_degrees = initial_degrees + degrees_moved_1 + degrees_moved_2\n\nprint(total_degrees)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the total degrees from the ground to the sun."
