At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to keep track of all the brownies Greta received throughout the day and subtract the brownies that were eaten. Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially:**\n   - Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.\n   - Her office gave her 1/2 dozen brownies. Since 1/2 dozen equals 6, she received 6 brownies from the office.\n   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. Since 4 dozen equals 48, she received 48 brownies from her friends.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of brownies eaten:**\n   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 dozen equals 18, 18 brownies were eaten.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of brownies left:**\n   - Add up all the brownies she initially had and subtract the number of brownies eaten.\n\nNow let's write a Python code to calculate the result:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of brownies Greta started with\nbrownies_from_self = 12  # 1 dozen\nbrownies_from_office = 6  # 1/2 dozen\nbrownies_from_friends = 48  # 4 dozen\n\ntotal_brownies = brownies_from_self + brownies_from_office + brownies_from_friends\n\n# Calculate the number of brownies eaten\nbrownies_eaten = 18  # 1 1/2 dozen\n\n# Calculate the number of brownies left\nbrownies_left = total_brownies - brownies_eaten\n\n# Print the result\nprint(brownies_left)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we find that the number of brownies Greta had left is \\(\\boxed{48}\\)."
