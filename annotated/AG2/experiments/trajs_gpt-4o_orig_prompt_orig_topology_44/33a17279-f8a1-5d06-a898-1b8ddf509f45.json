You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each.

Calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.\n2. Count the total deductions given to her sisters and charity.\n3. Subtract the total deductions from the total earnings to find out how much money she has left.\n\nWe can use Python to handle these arithmetic calculations efficiently.\n\nLet's start coding:\n\n```python\n# Total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes\ncookies_sold = 80\nprice_per_cookie = 1\ncupcakes_sold = 60\nprice_per_cupcake = 4\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = (cookies_sold * price_per_cookie) + (cupcakes_sold * price_per_cupcake)\n\n# Total deductions (to sisters and charity)\ngifts_to_sisters = 2 * 10  # $10 to each sister\ndonation_to_charity = 15\n\ntotal_deductions = gifts_to_sisters + donation_to_charity\n\n# Calculate remaining money\nmoney_left = total_earnings - total_deductions\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'Money Suzanne has left: {money_left}')\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount of money Suzanne has left after all her deductions."
