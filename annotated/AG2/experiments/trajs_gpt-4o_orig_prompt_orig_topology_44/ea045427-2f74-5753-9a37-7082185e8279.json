You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each.

Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of five notebooks.\n2. Calculate the cost of one ballpen.\n3. Calculate the cost of one notebook and two ballpens, then find the cost of the pencil case, which is twice that sum.\n4. Add all the costs to find the total amount spent by William.\n\nHere's the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices\nnotebook_price = Rational(150, 100)  # $1.50 in fractional form\nballpen_price = Rational(50, 100)    # $0.50 in fractional form\n\n# Purchases\nnotebook_count = 5\nballpen_count = 1\n\n# Calculate costs\ncost_notebooks = notebook_count * notebook_price\ncost_ballpen = ballpen_count * ballpen_price\n\n# Calculate pencil case cost\nnotebook_and_two_ballpens_cost = notebook_price + 2 * ballpen_price\npencil_case_cost = 2 * notebook_and_two_ballpens_cost\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_notebooks + cost_ballpen + pencil_case_cost\n\n# Output result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis program will use fractions to calculate the prices, ensuring we avoid decimals.
