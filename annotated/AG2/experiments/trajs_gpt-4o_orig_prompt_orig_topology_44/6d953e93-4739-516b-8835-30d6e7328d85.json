  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll first set up an equation to represent the situation. \n\n**Key Idea: Setting up an equation**\n\nThe total earnings on Thursday can be calculated by summing the charges for truck and car tires:\n- Earnings from truck tires on Thursday = \\(6 \\times 60\\)\n- Earnings from car tires on Thursday = \\(4 \\times 40\\)\n\nLet \\(x\\) represent the number of car tires repaired on Friday. Then the earnings on Friday will be:\n- Earnings from car tires on Friday = \\(x \\times 40\\)\n\nAccording to the problem, the mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday. Therefore, the equation to solve is:\n\\[ (6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40) - 40 = x \\times 40 \\]\n\nLet's solve this using Python and sympy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# calculate earnings on Thursday\nearnings_thursday = 6 * 60 + 4 * 40\n\n# setup the equation\nequation = Eq(earnings_thursday - 40, x * 40)\n\n# solve for x\ncar_tires_friday = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\nprint(car_tires_friday)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the number of car tires repaired on Friday by solving the equation, which is based on the given conditions. Run this code to find out the answer."
