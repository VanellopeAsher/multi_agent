  "problem": "Upon the conclusion of the academic year, Kate requested her instructor for the 3 containers of 64 crayons that were all reduced to tiny fragments. The instructor consented. Kate brought the crayons to her house and chose to create crayon muffins by fusing 8 tiny fragments of crayons in a muffin tin that she heated in an oven for a short period.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nUpon the conclusion of the academic year, Kate requested her instructor for the 3 containers of 64 crayons that were all reduced to tiny fragments.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to determine how many crayon muffins Kate can make with the crayons she has. Each crayon muffin requires 8 tiny fragments of crayons. Since Kate has 3 containers of 64 crayons each, we can calculate the total number of crayons and divide by 8 to find the number of crayon muffins. Finally, we multiply the number of muffins by $1.50 to find the total earnings.\n\nLet's translate this into Python code to calculate the result:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic computation, though in this case, it's not strictly necessary\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of crayon fragments\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# Number of crayons per muffin\ncrayons_per_muffin = 8\n\n# Calculate the number of muffins\nnumber_of_muffins = total_crayons // crayons_per_muffin\n\n# Price per muffin as a rational number\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(150, 100)\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = number_of_muffins * price_per_muffin\n\n# Print the total earnings in dollars\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total amount of money Kate can earn in a fraction form."
