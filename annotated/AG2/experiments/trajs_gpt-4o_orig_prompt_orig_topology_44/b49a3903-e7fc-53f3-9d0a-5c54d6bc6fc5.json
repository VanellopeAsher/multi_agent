Insert rows of yellow tulips between these rows as specified.\n4. Calculate the total number of rows.\n\nWe'll use Python to do these calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Key Idea\nThis problem can be solved with Python code directly, so we will write a program to solve it.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- For the red tulips: Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row, and he has 36 red tulips in total.\n- For the blue tulips: Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, and he has 24 blue tulips in total.\n- For the yellow tulips, he will decide the number of rows based on how many rows are needed to place them between the existing rows.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Calculate rows for red tulips\nred_tulips = 36\nred_per_row = 6\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_per_row\n\n# Calculate rows for blue tulips\nblue_tulips = 24\nblue_per_row = 8\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_per_row\n\n# Total rows of red and blue tulips\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\n# Since Jackson adds a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips,\n# if each color (red or blue) is immediately followed by yellow and they are consecutive,\n# we need at least one less than the total of those rows as an estimate\n# (since the last row does not have one after it).\nyellow_rows_needed = total_rows - 1\n\n# Adjust if he can only plant a limited number of yellow rows\nyellow_tulips = 30\nyellow_per_row = 5\nyellow_rows_available = yellow_tulips // yellow_per_row\n\n# He can plant the minimum of rows needed or rows available\nyellow_rows = min(yellow_rows_needed, yellow_rows_available)\n\n# Total rows of flowers\ntotal_flower_rows = total_rows + yellow_rows\n\nprint(total_flower_rows)\n```\n\nExecuting the code above will give the total number of rows Jackson will plant, considering the placement of the yellow tulips.
