You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

Afterward, we'll determine the number of seashells each girl brought back based on the information given.\n\nKey Idea:\n- Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n- Each boy collected 60 shells, so the total number of shells collected by the boys is \\(10 \\times 60 = 600\\).\n- According to the problem, the girls collectively brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many shells as the boys. Therefore, each girl brought a total number of seashells which is the total amount of girlsâ€™ shells divided by the number of girls, which is 10.\n\nLet's calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the number of seashells each girl collected\nseashells_per_girl = symbols('s')\n\n# Total shells collected by boys\nshells_by_boys = 600\n\n# Total shells collected by girls based on the problem statement\ntotal_girls_shells = shells_by_boys + 4.5 * shells_by_boys\n\n# Equation to solve for shells_per_girl\nequation = Eq(total_girls_shells, 10 * seashells_per_girl)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, seashells_per_girl)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Number of seashells brought by each girl:\", solution[0])\n```\n\nLet's solve this problem to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl."
