You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries. If Robert has 3000 cherries, and has 1000 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?"

Richard has 1000 fewer cherries than Robert, so Richard will have 3000 - 1000 cherries.\n3. To find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to find Jerry's share. Since we know the total number of cherries (6000) and the shares of Robert and Richard, we can find Jerry's share by subtracting the cherries of Richard and Robert from the total.\n4. Finally, calculate the difference between the cherries Robert and Jerry have.\n\nThis can be solved directly using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Importing symbols and equations from sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Defining the knowns\ntotal_cherries = 6000\ncherries_robert = 3000\n\n# Calculate how many cherries Richard has\ncherries_richard = cherries_robert - 1000\n\n# The remaining cherries go to Jerry\ncherries_jerry = total_cherries - (cherries_robert + cherries_richard)\n\n# Calculate the difference in cherries between Robert and Jerry\nmore_cherries_robert_than_jerry = cherries_robert - cherries_jerry\n\n# Output the result\nprint(more_cherries_robert_than_jerry)\n```\n\nRunning this code will yield the number of cherries Robert has more than Jerry."
