Determine the revenue Tara made from selling the bags.\n3. Set up an equation where the revenue minus the cost equals the stated profit of $160.\n4. Solve the equation to find out how many packs Tara bought.\n\nLet's set up the equations:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of 5 canvas bags that Tara bought.\n- The cost of \\( x \\) packs is \\( 4x \\) since each pack costs $4.\n- The total number of bags is \\( 5x \\) because each pack contains 5 bags.\n- The revenue from selling the bags is \\( 8 \\times 5x \\) since each bag is sold for $8.\n- The profit is given as $160, so the equation for profit is:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 5x - 4x = 160 \\]\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this equation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(8 * 5 * x - 4 * x, 160)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f'Tara bought {solution[0]} packs of 5 canvas bags.')\n```\n\nThis program will find the number of packs Tara bought, which is the solution to the problem."

Each pack contains 5 bags, sold at $8 each, that comes to a revenue of \\( 40x \\) (because \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\) per pack).\n3.
