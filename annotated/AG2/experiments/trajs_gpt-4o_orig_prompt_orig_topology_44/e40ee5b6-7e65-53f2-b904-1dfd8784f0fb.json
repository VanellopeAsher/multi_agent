You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon.

Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars.\n4. Sum both costs to get the total expenditure.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the price of a one-gallon jar\nprice_one_gallon = 5\n\n# Define the variable for the price of a half-gallon jar\nprice_half_gallon = symbols('price_half_gallon')\n\n# Set up the equation: price_one_gallon = price_half_gallon + 2\nequation = price_one_gallon - (price_half_gallon + 2)\n\n# Solve the equation for the price of a half-gallon jar\nprice_half_gallon_value = solve(equation, price_half_gallon)[0]\n\n# Calculate the total cost for 10 one-gallon jars\ntotal_cost_one_gallon = 10 * price_one_gallon\n\n# Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars\ntotal_cost_half_gallon = 16 * price_half_gallon_value\n\n# Calculate the total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = total_cost_one_gallon + total_cost_half_gallon\n\n# Output the total expenditure\nprint(f\"The total expenditure is: {total_expenditure}\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the price of the half-gallon jar and uses it to find the total sum of money spent on the jars."
