You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

The key idea is to calculate the total distance he runs, the total time he spends running, and then use the formula for speed: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Running Time}}\n\\]\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Calculate John's Running Distances:**\n   - John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much the other two days.\n   - Calculate the running times for each day:\n     - Day 1: 3 hours\n     - Day 2: 3/2 hours (half of 3 hours)\n     - Day 3: 3/2 hours\n\n2. **Total Weekly Running Distance:**\n   - Sum of distances run over the three days should be equal to 60 miles.\n\n3. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - Let the speed be \\(x\\) miles per hour.\n   - Total distance = \\(3x + \\frac{3}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2}x = 60\\)\n\n4. **Solve for Speed \\(x\\):**\n\nHereâ€™s the Python program to calculate the speed:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for speed\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation for total distance\nequation = Eq(3*x + (3/2)*x + (3/2)*x, 60)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nspeed = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the result, the speed\nprint(f\"John's running speed is {speed[0]} miles per hour.\")\n```\n\nRunning this Python code will give us the speed in miles per hour that John runs to meet his weekly goal of 60 miles. Let's execute it."
