You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

Here's how we can proceed:\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\n- First, determine the rate at which one individual works.  \n- Second, use the rate of one individual to find out the rate of 5 individuals working together.  \n- Finally, calculate the time taken for the team of 5 individuals to complete the entire house.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Calculate the rate of one individual:**\n\n   Since a single individual can complete painting half of a house in 5 days, the rate of one individual is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Rate of one individual} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{2 \\times 5 \\text{ days}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\text{ house per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the rate of 5 individuals:**\n\n   Since each individual works at a rate of \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) house per day, 5 individuals working together will have a combined rate of:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rate of 5 individuals} = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ house per day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken for 5 individuals to paint the entire house:**\n\n   If the team of 5 individuals paints \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) house per day, they will need:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time taken} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ house per day}} = 2 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert days to hours:**\n\n   Since there are 24 hours in a day, the time taken in hours is:\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ days} \\times 24 \\text{ hours per day} = 48 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculation\nrate_of_one = Rational(1, 10)  # rate of one individual in house per day\nrate_of_five = 5 * rate_of_one  # rate of five individuals in house per day\ntime_days = Rational(1, rate_of_five)  # total time in days\ntime_hours = time_days * 24  # total time in hours\n\nprint(f\"Hours required for 5 individuals to paint an entire house: {time_hours}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will yield the final answer. Let's calculate the result."
