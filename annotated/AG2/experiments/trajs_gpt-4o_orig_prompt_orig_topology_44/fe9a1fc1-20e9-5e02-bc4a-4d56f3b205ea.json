You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We'll use a mix of algebraic reasoning and Python programming to facilitate calculations. Here is how we can approach this:\n\nGiven:\n- Katarina has \\( K = 6.8 \\times 10 \\) cookies.\n- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \\( K = M - 5 \\).\n- Max has 1.2 times ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \\( M = 1.2 \\times (C + 10) \\).\n- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \\( S = M + 23 \\).\n\nUsing the above equations, we can first find the number of cookies each person has and then find the total number. Let's code this in Python using sympy to solve the equations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nK, M, C, S = symbols('K M C S')\n\n# Katarina's cookies\nK_value = 6.8 * 10\n\n# Equations based on the problem statement\neq1 = Eq(K, K_value)  # Katarina's cookies = 6.8 times of ten cookies\neq2 = Eq(K, M - 5)    # Katarina has 5 less than Max\neq3 = Eq(M, 1.2 * (C + 10)) # Max's cookies\neq4 = Eq(S, M + 23)   # Summer has 23 more than Max\n\n# Solve the equations\nsol = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4), (K, M, C, S))\n\n# Calculate the total number of cookies\ntotal_cookies = sol[K] + sol[M] + sol[C] + sol[S]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cookies)\n```\n\nLet's run the code to get the total number of cookies they have."
