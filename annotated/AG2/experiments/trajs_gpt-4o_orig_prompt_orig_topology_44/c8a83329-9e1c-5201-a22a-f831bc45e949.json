You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.

We'll break down the steps and use a simple subtraction and addition approach here.\n\nKey Idea: This problem can be solved through simple arithmetic operations, without needing more complex reasoning or code.\n\nLet's compute the solution step by step:\n\n1. Determine the initial number of Valentine's cards Erica has:\n   \n   - Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.\n   - Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. (The number of cards in each box is not provided, so this will not affect the calculation.)\n\n2. Calculate the total number of cards Erica passed out:\n\n   - Passed out to classmates: 24 cards\n   - Passed out to family: 5 cards\n\n3. Sum the cards Erica received from family and friends:\n   \n   - Received from family and friends: 17 cards\n\n4. Subtract the cards passed out from the initial cards, then add the cards received.\n\nLet's compute it directly using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial cards made by Erica\ninitial_cards_made_by Erica = 20\n\n# Cards passed out\ncards_passed_out = 24 + 5\n\n# Cards received\ncards_received = 17\n\n# Calculate final number of cards\nfinal_cards = initial_cards_made_by_Erica - cards_passed_out + cards_received\n\nprint(final_cards)\n```\n\nPlease run the code and let me know the result for the final number of cards Erica has."
