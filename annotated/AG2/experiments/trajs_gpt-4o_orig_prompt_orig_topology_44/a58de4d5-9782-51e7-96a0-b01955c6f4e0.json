To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients for making 10 jars of the mixture and then subtract this cost from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Calculate the cost of ingredients per jar and then for 10 jars.\n2. Calculate the revenue from selling 10 jars.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n1. **Cost calculation for one jar**:\n   - Passion fruit cost: \\(2 \\text{ pounds} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n   - Jackfruit cost: \\(1.5 \\text{ pounds} \\times 8 \\text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n   - Honey cost: \\(2 \\text{ pounds} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/pound} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n   - Total cost per jar = \\(12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n\n2. **Total cost for 10 jars**:\n   - \\(44 \\text{ dollars/jar} \\times 10 \\text{ jars} = 440 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n\n3. **Revenue from selling 10 jars**:\n   - \\(50 \\text{ dollars/jar} \\times 10 \\text{ jars} = 500 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n\n4. **Profit calculation**:\n   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost\n   - Profit = \\(500 - 440 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n\nNow let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Cost per pound for each ingredient\ncost_passion_fruit_per_pound = 6\ncost_jackfruit_per_pound = 8\ncost_honey_per_pound = 10\n\n# Amount needed for one jar\namount_passion_fruit = 2\namount_jackfruit = 1.5\namount_honey = 2\n\n# Calculate cost per jar\ncost_per_jar = (amount_passion_fruit * cost_passion_fruit_per_pound +\n                 amount_jackfruit * cost_jackfruit_per_pound +\n                 amount_honey * cost_honey_per_pound)\n\n# Total cost for 10 jars\ntotal_cost = cost_per_jar * 10\n\n# Revenue from selling 10 jars\nrevenue = 50 * 10\n\n# Profit calculation\nprofit = revenue - total_cost\n\n# Output the profit\nprint(profit)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we obtain the profit. The final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]"
