You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

Use the information given to set up equations for the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the number of goals Richie scored.\n2. Solve these equations to find the number of goals scored by each teenager.\n3. Sum up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna to find the total number of goals scored by all three teens.\n\nHere's how this can be translated into Python code using basic arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\n# Let R, M, A represent the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna respectively\nR = 90  # Richie scored 90 goals\nM = R - 30  # Mark scored 30 fewer goals than Richie\nA = R - 55  # Anna scored 55 fewer goals than Richie\n\n# The total number of goals scored by all three teenagers\ntotal_goals = R + M + A\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_goals)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the result to get the total number of goals."

Mark scored 30 goals less than Richie, so Mark scored \\( R - 30 = 90 - 30 = 60 \\) goals. Anna scored 55 goals less than Richie, so Anna scored \\( R - 55 = 90 - 55 = 35 \\) goals.\n\nThe total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:\n\\[ R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35 = 185 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \\(\\boxed{185}\\)."
