You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rows Jackson can plant for red tulips and blue tulips separately and then add those numbers together. Since the problem can be solved directly with calculations, I'll proceed with writing a Python program to compute the number of rows.\n\nJackson can plant 6 red tulips per row and has 36 red tulips. Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Red Tulip Rows} = \\frac{36}{6} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for the blue tulips, Jackson can plant 8 blue tulips per row and has 24 blue tulips. Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Blue Tulip Rows} = \\frac{24}{8} \\]\n\nThe total number of rows will be the sum of the rows for red and blue tulips.\n\nHere's the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\n\nred_tulips_per_row = 6\nblue_tulips_per_row = 8\n\nred_rows = red_tulips / red_tulips_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips / blue_tulips_per_row\n\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\n# Since we are using fractions/rational representation:\nprint(Rational(total_rows))\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of rows Jackson will plant in his garden."
