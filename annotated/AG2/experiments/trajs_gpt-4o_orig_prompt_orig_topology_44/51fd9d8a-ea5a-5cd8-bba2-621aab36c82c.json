You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 0.1 times of one thousand years old.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 0.1 times 1000 years, which means \\( P + Q + J = 100 \\).\n2. Paul is 0.1 times 100 years older than John, which means \\( Q = J + 10 \\).\n3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which means \\( P = Q + J \\).\n\nWe need to find the age of Peter.\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express Peter's age in terms of Jean's age.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve these equations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables for Peter's, Paul's, and Jean's ages\nP, Q, J = symbols('P Q J')\n\n# Given equations from the problem\neq1 = Eq(P + Q + J, 100)\neq2 = Eq(Q, J + 10)\neq3 = Eq(P, Q + J)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (P, Q, J))\n\n# Extract Peter's age from the solution\npeter_age = solution[P]\n\n# Print the age of Peter in its simplest form\nprint(peter_age)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the age of Peter, expressed in a simplified form using fractions or radicals if applicable."
