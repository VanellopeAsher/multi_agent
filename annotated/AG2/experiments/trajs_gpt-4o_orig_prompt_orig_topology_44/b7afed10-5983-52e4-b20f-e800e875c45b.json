You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSam ran 3.5 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

Calculate the total miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\n2. Calculate the total miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday.\n3. Add the two totals together to find the total miles Sam ran in the week.\n\nThis is a straightforward math problem that can be solved directly using Python. Let's write the code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\nmiles_MWF = 3.5 * 3  # Sam ran 3 days\n\n# Number of miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday\nmiles_TT = 5.5 * 2  # Sam ran 2 days\n\n# Total miles Sam ran during the week\ntotal_miles = miles_MWF + miles_TT\n\n# Printing the result using fractions to keep in line with the requirement\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\nprint(\"Total miles Sam ran this week:\", Fraction(total_miles))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the total number of miles Sam ran this week in fractional form."
