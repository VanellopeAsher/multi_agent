You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow Case 3. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Calculate the total time John spent on all activities.\n2. Determine how much 30% of his total time was.\n3. Use the information provided to calculate how much time John spent on sightseeing.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. John spent 6 hours boating.\n2. He spent half of the boating time swimming, therefore: \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Swimming time} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Show time} = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. The total time for these activities (boating, swimming, shows) is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time for listed activities} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. The total time spent by John is 30% of his vacation time, so we can set up the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   0.3 \\times \\text{Total vacation time} = 15\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for the total vacation time:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total vacation time} = \\frac{15}{0.3} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n6. Now, subtract the time spent on the listed activities from the total vacation time to find the time spent sightseeing:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sightseeing time} = 50 - 15 = 35 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nWe can compute these using Python and verify the result:\n\n```python\n# Python code\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given times\nboating_time = 6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshow_time = 3 * 2\n\n# Total listed activity time\ntotal_activity_time = boating_time + swimming_time + show_time\n\n# Total vacation time\ntotal_vacation_time = total_activity_time / 0.3\n\n# Sightseeing time\nsightseeing_time = total_vacation_time - total_activity_time\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(f\"Total Vacation Time: {Rational(total_vacation_time)} hours\")\nprint(f\"Time Spent Sightseeing: {Rational(sightseeing_time)} hours\")\n```\n\nRunning this program will verify that John spent 35 hours sightseeing, as expected. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{35}\n\\]"
