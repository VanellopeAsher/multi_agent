You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed.

We can calculate the areas separately and then add them together.\n\nHere's how we can solve the problem:\n\n1. **Dimensions of the comforter**:\n   - The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.\n   - The comforter needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\n   - Therefore, the comforter will be \\(6 + 2 = 8\\) feet long and \\(8 + 2 = 10\\) feet wide.\n\n2. **Dimensions of the duvet cover**:\n   - The duvet cover is 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.\n\n3. **Calculate the area**:\n   - Area of the comforter fabric: \\(8 \\times 10\\)\n   - Area of the duvet cover fabric: \\(9 \\times 11\\)\n\n4. **Total area of fabric needed**:\n   - Sum of the areas of comforter and duvet cover fabrics.\n\nNow let's write the code to calculate the total area:\n\n```python\n# import the needed library\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# dimensions for the comforter\nlength_comforter = 6 + 2  # 8 feet\nwidth_comforter = 8 + 2   # 10 feet\n\n# dimensions for the duvet cover\nlength_duvet = 9\nwidth_duvet = 11\n\n# calculate areas\narea_comforter = length_comforter * width_comforter\narea_duvet = length_duvet * width_duvet\n\n# total area\ntotal_area = area_comforter + area_duvet\n\n# print the total area in square feet\nprint(total_area)\n```\n\nRun the above code to find out the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy."
