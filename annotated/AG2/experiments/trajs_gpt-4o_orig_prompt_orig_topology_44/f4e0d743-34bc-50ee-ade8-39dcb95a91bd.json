  "problem": "Every month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Additionally, Madeline also buys a special shampoo for her dog that costs $15 per month and a toy that costs $10 every two months. If there are 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year, how much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

We will break down the costs into monthly and yearly expenses and then sum them up. This is a straightforward calculation, so it can be solved with Python code directly. Here’s how we’ll do it:\n\n1. Calculate the weekly cost of food and convert it to a monthly cost, then a yearly cost.\n2. Add the cost of treats, medicine, shampoo, and toys, considering their respective purchase frequencies.\n3. Sum everything to get the total yearly expenditure.\n\nNow, let’s write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs in dollars\nfood_per_week = 25\ntreats_per_month = 20\nmedicine_per_month = 100\nshampoo_per_month = 15\ntoy_per_two_months = 10\n\n# Calculation\nmonths_per_year = 12\nweeks_per_month = 4\n\n# Calculate yearly costs\nfood_per_year = food_per_week * weeks_per_month * months_per_year\ntreats_per_year = treats_per_month * months_per_year\nmedicine_per_year = medicine_per_month * months_per_year\nshampoo_per_year = shampoo_per_month * months_per_year\ntoy_per_year = (toy_per_two_months / Rational(2)) * months_per_year\n\n# Total yearly expenditure\ntotal_per_year = food_per_year + treats_per_year + medicine_per_year + shampoo_per_year + toy_per_year\n\n# Output\nprint(total_per_year)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year."
