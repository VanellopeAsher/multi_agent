You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month.

This falls under Case 1, where we can directly solve the problem using basic arithmetic.\n\nKey Idea: We'll use variables to represent changes in weight over different periods and calculate backwards to find the initial weight.\n\nLet's break down the changes in Mark's weight and use arithmetic to find the initial weight:\n\n1. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.\n2. Mark gained 5 pounds per month for 2 months.\n3. Mark's final weight is 70 pounds.\n\nWe'll set up an equation to find the initial weight.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let x be the initial weight before Mark fell ill\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation based on the problem statement\n# Initial weight - (3 months * 10 pounds per month) + (2 months * 5 pounds per month) = Final weight 70 pounds\nequation = Eq(x - 3*10 + 2*5, 70)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance or if you want me to calculate any part of this manually!"
