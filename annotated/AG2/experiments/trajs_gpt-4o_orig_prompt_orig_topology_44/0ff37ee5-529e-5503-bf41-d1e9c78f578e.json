You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Calculate the total money Ali has:\n   - Ali has $20 bills: 6 Ã— $20 = $120\n   - Ali has $10 bills: \\( 10x \\) dollars\n   - Total money = \\( 10x + 120 \\).\n\n2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:\n   - Money given to sister = \\(\\frac{1}{2}(10x + 120) = \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\\).\n\n3. Calculate the remaining money after giving to his sister:\n   - Remaining money = \\( 10x + 120 - \\frac{10x + 120}{2} = \\frac{10x + 120}{2} \\).\n\n4. Ali spends \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the remaining money on dinner:\n   - Money spent on dinner = \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{10x + 120}{2} = \\frac{3(10x + 120)}{10}\\).\n\n5.  Calculate the money left after buying dinner:\n   - Remaining money = Remaining money - Money spent on dinner = \\(\\frac{10x + 120}{2} - \\frac{3(10x + 120)}{10}\\).\n\n6. We know Ali has $32 after buying dinner:\n   - Set up the equation: \n\n\\[\n\\frac{10x + 120}{2} - \\frac{3(10x + 120)}{10} = 32\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\ntotal_money = 10*x + 120\nafter_sister = total_money / 2\nspend_on_dinner = (3/5) * after_sister\nremaining_money = after_sister - spend_on_dinner\n\n# Equation for the remaining amount\nequation = Eq(remaining_money, 32)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nLet's perform this calculation."
