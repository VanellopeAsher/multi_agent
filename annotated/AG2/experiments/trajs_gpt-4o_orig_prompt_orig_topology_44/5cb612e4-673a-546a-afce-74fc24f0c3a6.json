If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation step by step. We need to determine the number of bags of wheat sold using the given costs and profits involved in the transaction. We'll proceed by calculating the total cost, total income, and using the provided profit information.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe'll use an algebraic approach to derive an equation for the number of bags sold and solve it using Python. This fits under Case 1, as the problem can be handled with some calculations.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. **Cost to Buy and Transport:**\n   - Buying cost per bag is $20.\n   - Transportation cost per bag is $2.\n   - Total cost per bag is \\(20 + 2 = 22\\).\n\n2. **Selling Price:**\n   - Selling price per bag is $30.\n\n3. **Profit Calculation:**\n   - Profit is the difference between total sales and total cost.\n   - Let the number of bags sold be \\( n \\).\n   - The total cost for \\( n \\) bags is \\( 22n \\).\n   - The total revenue from selling \\( n \\) bags is \\( 30n \\).\n   - Profit is given by the equation: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost.\n   - \\( 400 = 30n - 22n \\).\n\n### Solve for \\( n \\):\nUsing the equation \\( 400 = 30n - 22n \\), we can solve for \\( n \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define symbol\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Define the equation based on profit calculation\nprofit_equation = Eq(30*n - 22*n, 400)\n\n# Solve for the number of bags\nsolution = solve(profit_equation, n)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will solve for \\( n \\), and we can find the number of bags sold. The solution of the equation will give us the answer to the problem."
