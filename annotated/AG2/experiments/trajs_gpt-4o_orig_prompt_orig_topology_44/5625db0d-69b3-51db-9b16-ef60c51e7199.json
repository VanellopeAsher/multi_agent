The next day, the price increased to $25 per fruit, but the store also offered a 15% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 15 apples.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.

Calculate the total discounted price Sheila paid on Wednesday.\n3. Find the difference between the amounts paid by Clara and Sheila.\n\nHere is how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Calculate Clara's Total on Tuesday:**\n   - Clara buys 15 apples at $15 each.\n   - Total cost before the discount = \\(15 \\times 15\\).\n   - Clara uses a $3 voucher.\n   - Total amount paid = Total cost before voucher - $3.\n\n2. **Calculate Sheila's Total on Wednesday:**\n   - The price increased to $25 each.\n   - Total cost before discount = \\(15 \\times 25\\).\n   - Sheila gets a 15% discount.\n   - Total amount paid = Total cost before discount \\(\\times (1 - 0.15)\\).\n\n3. Compute the difference between the amounts paid by Clara and Sheila.\n\nLet's translate this into Python code using the sympy package for precise calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate Clara's total\nclara_price_per_apple = 15\nclara_number_apples = 15\nclara_total_without_voucher = clara_price_per_apple * clara_number_apples\nclara_voucher = 3\nclara_total_with_voucher = clara_total_without_voucher - clara_voucher\n\n# Calculate Sheila's total\nsheila_price_per_apple = 25\nsheila_number_apples = 15\nsheila_total_without_discount = sheila_price_per_apple * sheila_number_apples\nsheila_discount_rate = Rational(15, 100)  # 15% discount\nsheila_total_with_discount = sheila_total_without_discount * (1 - sheila_discount_rate)\n\n# Calculate the difference\nprice_difference = sheila_total_with_discount - clara_total_with_voucher\n\nprint(price_difference)\n```\n\nRun the code to find the difference in the prices paid by Clara and Sheila."
