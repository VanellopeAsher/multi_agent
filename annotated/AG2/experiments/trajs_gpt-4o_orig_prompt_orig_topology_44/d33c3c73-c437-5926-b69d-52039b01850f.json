You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Let's use Python, with symbolic computation to maintain fractions, to solve this. Here's the key idea for solving the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to Monday's depth.\n2. Determine Wednesday's depth by taking two-thirds of Tuesday's depth.\n3. Calculate the increase in Thursday's depth by finding half of the difference between Tuesday's and Wednesday's depths. Then add this increase to the depth on Wednesday.\n\nWe'll use the `sympy` library to handle fractions and simplify calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify\n\n# Define the symbolic variable\ndepth_Monday = 17  # depth on Monday in feet\n\n# Calculate the depth on Tuesday\ndepth_Tuesday = depth_Monday + 7\n\n# Calculate the depth on Wednesday\ndepth_Wednesday = Rational(2, 3) * depth_Tuesday\n\n# Calculate the change from Tuesday to Wednesday\nchange_Tuesday_to_Wednesday = depth_Tuesday - depth_Wednesday\n\n# Calculate the depth increase on Thursday\nincrease_Thursday = Rational(1, 2) * change_Tuesday_to_Wednesday\n\n# Calculate the depth on Thursday\ndepth_Thursday = depth_Wednesday + increase_Thursday\n\n# Simplify and print the result\ndepth_Thursday_simplified = simplify(depth_Thursday)\nprint(depth_Thursday_simplified)\n```\n\nRunning this code will provide the depth of water in the tank on Thursday in an exact fractional form."
