You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days available to Andy to achieve his goal and the total calorie deficit required. Then, by dividing the total deficit by the number of days, we find the daily calorie deficit needed.\n\nHere's how we'll solve it:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight loss Andy wants, which is 30 lbs.\n2. Calculate the total calorie deficit needed using the fact that 1 lb of weight loss requires a deficit of 3500 calories.\n3. Determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.\n4. Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit required.\n\nNow, let's write a Python program to find this out:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols\n\n# Total weight loss in pounds\nweight_loss_lbs = 30\n\n# Calories needed to lose one pound\ncalories_per_pound = 3500\n\n# Total calorie deficit needed\ntotal_calories_needed = weight_loss_lbs * calories_per_pound\n\n# Define the number of days from December 31 to July 19\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nstart_date = datetime(2022, 12, 31)\nend_date = datetime(2023, 7, 19)\nnumber_of_days = (end_date - start_date).days\n\n# Calculate the daily calorie deficit\ndaily_calorie_deficit = Rational(total_calories_needed, number_of_days)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of: {daily_calorie_deficit} calories per day\")\n```\n\nWe use the `Rational` function from sympy to ensure the result is shown as a fraction instead of a decimal, fulfilling the requirement to use fractions or radical forms instead of decimals.\n\nExecuting the code will provide us with the answer in the required format."
