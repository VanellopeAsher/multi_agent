You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

Identify which items are considered food and which are not:\n   - Food items: milk, eggs\n   - Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, roach traps\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of the items without tax:\n   - Total cost of food items: milk (2 dollars) + eggs (3 dollars)\n   - Total cost of non-food items: light bulbs (3 dollars) + cups (3 dollars) + roach traps (4 dollars)\n\n3. Apply a 10% tax to the non-food items.\n\n4. Calculate the total cost with tax included.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Prices of items\nmilk_price = 2\neggs_price = 3\nlight_bulbs_price = 3\ncups_price = 3\nroach_traps_price = 4\n\n# Compute cost of food and non-food items\nfood_cost = milk_price + eggs_price\nnon_food_cost = light_bulbs_price + cups_price + roach_traps_price\n\n# Apply 10% tax only to non-food items\ntax_rate = 0.10\ntax_amount = non_food_cost * tax_rate\n\n# Total cost with tax\ntotal_cost_with_tax = food_cost + non_food_cost + tax_amount\n\n# Print the result using fractions/radical forms\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(\"Total cost with tax (exact form):\", Rational(total_cost_with_tax).limit_denominator())\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate the total cost considering the given condition of applying a tax to the non-food items and print the total cost in the required form."
