You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn goes shopping and buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

Our task is to calculate the total cost of all the items, taking into account this tax on non-food items.\n\nHere's how we will solve it:\n\n1. Identify which items are considered food and which are not:\n   - Food items (no tax): milk, eggs, pack of cookies, bottle of water.\n   - Non-food items (subject to tax): light bulbs, cups, roach traps.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for food items.\n3. Calculate the total cost for non-food items.\n4. Apply the 10% tax to the non-food items.\n5. Sum the total cost of food items and the taxed non-food items.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices of each item\nmilk = 2\neggs = 3\ncookies = 2\nwater = 1\nlight_bulbs = 3\ncups = 3\nroach_traps = 4\n\n# Food items total\nfood_total = milk + eggs + cookies + water\n\n# Non-food items total\nnon_food_total = light_bulbs + cups + roach_traps\n\n# Calculate the tax on non-food items\ntax_rate = Rational(10, 100)  # 10% as a fraction\ntax = non_food_total * tax_rate\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = food_total + non_food_total + tax\n\n# Output the total cost in fraction form\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nRun the code to find the total cost, which will be displayed in fraction form."
