      "content": "To solve the problem of finding Mark's initial weight, we can use a simple mathematical approach. Here's the key idea:\n\nCase 1 applies here, as it can be directly solved by understanding that the problem describes a linear relationship where Mark lost 10 pounds per month for a certain number of months until he reached a final weight.\n\nWe'll set up an equation based on the problem description:\n\n\\[ \\text{initial\\_weight} - 10 \\times \\text{months} = 70 \\]\n\nFrom the problem, we know he lost 10 pounds each month until he reached a weight of 70 pounds, but we don't know for how many months this weight loss occurred. To determine his initial weight, we'd normally solve for the number of months if it were given. \n\nHowever, since the problem is under-specified and doesn't tell us the number of months, we can only setup a formula based on a possible `months` variable. I'll show the code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\ninitial_weight, months = symbols('initial_weight months')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(initial_weight - 10 * months, 70)\n\n# We can't solve for one variable without the other one specified, let's emphasize that both need to be known.\nprint(\"Equation to determine initial weight given the number of months: \", equation)\n```\n\nThis code outputs an equation that, if you knew how many months he lost weight for, you could solve for the initial weight. But without knowing the duration, the initial weight remains 10 times the number of months added to 70. \n\nIf you are aware of the months he has been losing weight, you can replace the `months` variable with a specific value, and solve the equation for `initial_weight`, then let me know so I can continue with the solution given a specific duration."

However, if you provide the number of months that Mark was losing weight, we can solve for the initial weight.\n\nFor example, if Mark lost weight for 3 months, we can substitute the value into the equation and find the initial weight. Please let me know the duration in months, and we can proceed with solving it."

We can substitute this value into the equation and solve for the initial weight.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ \\text{initial\\_weight} - 10 \\times 3 = 70 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\ninitial_weight, months = symbols('initial_weight months')\n\n# Assume Mark lost weight for 3 months\nassumed_months = 3\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(initial_weight - 10 * assumed_months, 70)\n\n# Solve for the initial weight\ninitial_weight_solution = solve(equation, initial_weight)[0]\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(initial_weight_solution)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the initial weight if Mark lost weight for 3 months. Once I get the result, I can put it in a box. Let me know if you have the actual number of months!"
