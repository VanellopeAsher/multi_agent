For the first test:\n   - Total sets of ten questions: 7.5\n   - Completion rate: 0.5 sets per hour\n   - Total time given: 0.8 sets of ten hours\n   - Calculate the number of sets Mark could complete in 0.8 hours at the given rate, then subtract from the total sets to find the incomplete sets.\n\n2.
