You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Monday, a water tank measured 17 feet deep.

On Monday, the water tank is 17 feet deep.\n2. On Tuesday, the water level rises by 7 feet, so we add this increase to Monday's depth.\n3. On Wednesday, the water level decreases to two-thirds of Tuesday's depth. This requires calculating two-thirds of the water depth on Tuesday.\n\nLet's use Python and the `sympy` package to handle fractions and ensure the result is exact.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Monday's depth\nmonday_depth = 17\n\n# Tuesday's depth\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + 7\n\n# Wednesday's depth, two-thirds of Tuesday's depth\nwednesday_depth = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_depth\n\n# Output the result\nprint(wednesday_depth)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, the water depth in the tank on Wednesday will be displayed."
