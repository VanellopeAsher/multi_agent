We can calculate the growth by following these steps:\n\n1. Understand the growth process:\n    - Initially, at the end of the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.\n    - By the end of the second week, it doubles in height, making it \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches tall.\n    - At the end of the third week, the height is 10 inches.\n\n2. Determine the growth during the third week:\n    - Since the beanstalk was 6 inches tall after the second week and 10 inches tall after the third week, it grew by \\(10 - 6 = 4\\) inches during the third week.\n\nLet's implement the calculation in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of height differences\nheight_week_1 = 3\nheight_week_2 = height_week_1 * 2\nheight_week_3 = 10\n\n# Growth during the third week\ngrowth_week_3 = height_week_3 - height_week_2\n\nprint(growth_week_3)\n```\n\nThe beanstalk grew \\(\\boxed{4}\\) inches during the third week."
