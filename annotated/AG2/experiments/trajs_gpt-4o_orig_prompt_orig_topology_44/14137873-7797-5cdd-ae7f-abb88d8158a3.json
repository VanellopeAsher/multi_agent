Upon landing, the seagull devoured half the quantity of french fries that Dave had consumed. Subsequently, three pigeons chased him away from the meal, and each pigeon consumed three fries.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Since the events that happen after Dave consumed the fries can describe the initial condition when reversed, it's a good idea to use this reverse-engineering technique. We will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the final number of fries left, which is 5.\n2. Calculate the number of fries before the ants carried away 1 fry.\n3. Calculate the number of fries after the raccoon took two-thirds.\n4. Calculate the number of fries before the pigeons ate 3 each.\n5. Calculate the number of fries after the seagull ate half of what Dave ate.\n6. Calculate the initial number of fries by adding back what Dave ate.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 6: Start with 5 fries remaining\nfries_remaining_after_ants = 5 + 1\n\n# Step 4: Reverse the raccoon's action (it ate 2/3, so 1/3 is remaining)\nfries_before_raccoon = fries_remaining_after_ants * 3\n\n# Step 3: Add back the fries 3 pigeons ate (3 each)\nfries_before_pigeons = fries_before_raccoon + 3 * 3\n\n# Step 2: The seagull ate half of Dave's amount, then consumed 7 fries (half of 14)\n# Let x be the initial amount of fries\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Create an equation with the known conditions\neq = Eq(fries_before_pigeons, x - 14 - 7)\n\n# Solve the equation\ninitial_fries = solve(eq, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The initial quantity of french fries was: {initial_fries}\")\n```\n\nOnce you run the code, you will find the initial number of fries.
