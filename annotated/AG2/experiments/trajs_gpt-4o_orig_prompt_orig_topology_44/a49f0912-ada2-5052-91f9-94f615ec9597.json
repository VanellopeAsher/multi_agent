You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

We use this information to find out how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\nWe'll solve this problem step-by-step as follows:\n\n1. **Calculate the time John spent swimming.**  \n   John spent 60 hours boating, and half of that time swimming.\n\n2. **Calculate the total time he spent watching shows.**  \n   John watched 30 different shows, each 20 hours long.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent on all activities.**  \n   We know this was 30% of his total vacation time spent. From this, calculate the total vacation time.\n\n4. **Calculate the time John spent sightseeing.**  \n   Since 40% of his total vacation time was spent sightseeing, use the total vacation time to find this value.\n\nLet's write Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Calculate swimming time\nboating_time = 60\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate show watching time\nnumber_of_shows = 30\nhours_per_show = 20\nshow_time = number_of_shows * hours_per_show\n\n# Step 3: Calculate total vacation time\n# Given that the show time is 30% of the total vacation time\n# Let vacation_time be the total vacation time\nvacation_time = symbols('vacation_time')\nequation = Eq(show_time, 0.3 * vacation_time)\ntotal_vacation_time = solve(equation, vacation_time)[0]\n\n# Step 4: Calculate sightseeing time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_vacation_time\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the amount of time John spent sightseeing based on the provided conditions.
