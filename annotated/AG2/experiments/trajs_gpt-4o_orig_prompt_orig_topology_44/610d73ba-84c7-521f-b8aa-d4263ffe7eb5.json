You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPaisley, Reggie, and Lynn went for a run.

Let's denote the distance that Lynn ran as \\( x \\).\n\nBased on the information given:\n\n1. Paisley ran 4 miles.\n2. Reggie ran a distance that was five times the distance that Paisley ran, which is \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) miles.\n3. Reggie also ran 3 miles more than Lynn, so Reggie's distance can also be expressed as \\( x + 3 \\).\n\nBy equating the two expressions for Reggie's distance, we have the equation:\n\\[ 20 = x + 3 \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(20, x + 3)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code uses sympy to solve the equation, and it prints the exact value of \\( x \\) in a symbolic form if necessary. Once you execute the code, it will give you the distance Lynn ran."
