You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

This problem can be solved through calculation, so we will write a Python program to find the answer.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Calculate the time spent in each activity.\n2. Calculate the total time spent based on the fact that watching shows constituted 30% of the total time.\n3. Calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time.\n\nNow let's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let T be the total time John spent on vacation\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Given data\nboating_time = 6.6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 3 * 2.5  # 3 shows, each 2.5 hours\n\n# Shows time was 30% of total time\nshows_percentage = 0.3\n\n# Equation: Shows time = 30% of Total time\neq = Eq(shows_time, shows_percentage * T)\n\n# Solve for total time\ntotal_time = solve(eq, T)[0]\n\n# Sightseeing is 40% of total time\nsightseeing_percentage = 0.4\nsightseeing_time = sightseeing_percentage * total_time\n\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the time spent sightseeing in hours.
