You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the original cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper. We know that Ethan saved 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning the cost of the materials was 80% of what the total cost would have been if he didn't save any money. We need this total cost.\n\nLet's assume Ethan's total cost (had he not made any savings) is \\( x \\). Since he saved 20% on this total cost, the cost of materials is 80% of \\( x \\). \n\nGiven:\n- Total savings = 20%\n- Cost of materials = 80% of the total cost\n\nWe need to solve for \\( x \\), knowing that savings implies \\( 0.8x = \\text{cost of materials} \\).\n\nWithout the exact cost of materials, we cannot compute the total cost numerically. Assuming we could verify the cost of materials in some manner or have it provided, we would compute the total cost this way:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let x be the original total cost\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Assume the known cost of materials. \n# For example, materials_cost = 800 (just for calculation logic understanding)\nmaterials_cost = 800\n\n# Equation: 0.8x = materials_cost\nequation = Eq(0.8 * x, materials_cost)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_cost = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nSince the exact cost of materials isn't provided in this context, you would replace `materials_cost = 800` with whatever the actual number is. Once that's known, solving will give you the total cost, \\( \\boxed{1000} \\) in this hypothetical case.\n\nTherefore, just input the actual materials cost, run the script, and it will yield the total cost."

Let me clarify the solution using non-decimal forms, as per the requirement.\n\nWhen we assume the cost of materials is 800 (as the hypothetical case we used), the calculation finds the original total cost \\( x \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(\\text{Materials Cost} = 800\\)\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[ 0.8x = 800 \\]\n\nSolving this equation:\n\\[ x = \\frac{800}{0.8} \\]\n\\[ x = 1000 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\) without decimals.
