We need to find out how many packets are needed for 24 s'mores.\n   \\[\n   \\lceil \\frac{24}{8} \\rceil = \\lceil 3 \\rceil = 3 \\text{ packets}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**\n   - Each box contains 3 packets.\n   - We need 3 packets, therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\lceil \\frac{3}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 1 \\rceil = 1 \\text{ box}\n   \\]\n\nThus, to meet the requirement for 24 s'mores, we need \\(\\boxed{1}\\) box of graham crackers. \n\nThe prior calculation and Python code are accurate, and this confirms that only one box is indeed required. \n\nHere is the Python code once more for re-confirmation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import ceiling\n\n# Calculate total s'mores needed\nchildren_smores = 9 * 2\nadults_smores = 6 * 1\ntotal_smores = children_smores + adults_smores\n\n# Calculate packets needed (each packet serves 8 s'mores)\npackets = ceiling(total_smores / 8)\n\n# Calculate boxes needed (each box contains 3 packets)\nboxes = ceiling(packets / 3)\n\n# Print the number of boxes needed\nprint(boxes)  # Output should be 1\n```\n\nThis formulation properly verifies our calculation, resulting in \\(\\boxed{1}\\) box."
