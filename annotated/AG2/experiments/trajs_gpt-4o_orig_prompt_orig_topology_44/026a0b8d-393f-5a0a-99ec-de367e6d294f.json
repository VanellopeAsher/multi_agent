  "problem": "It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.\n\nKey idea: \nWe can represent the problem with algebra by introducing variables for the number of packets. Then, we solve for the number of tomato seed packets using Python and a package like sympy for symbolic computation.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( x \\) as the number of packets of tomato seeds.\n- \\( y \\) as the number of packets of celery seeds (which we know is 80).\n\nGiven:\n1. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40.\n2. A packet of celery seeds costs $30.\n3. The total cost is $3200.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[ 40x + 30y = 3200 \\]\n\nWe know \\( y = 80 \\), so substituting \\( y \\) into the equation gives us:\n\\[ 40x + 30(80) = 3200 \\]\n\nNow we can solve for \\( x \\).\n\nHereâ€™s the Python code to solve the equation:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Given: number of celery packets y = 80\ny = 80\n\n# Create the equation\nequation = Eq(40*x + 30*y, 3200)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of tomato seed packets (x). Run the code to find the value, and we will box the result."
