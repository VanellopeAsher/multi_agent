You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nColby wants to buy some gumballs.

Let's assume each gumball costs a certain amount, which is typically 25 cents (or 1 quarter) based on the context of such problems. \n\n**Key idea to solve the problem:**\n\n1. Calculate the total value of Colby's coins in cents.\n2. Determine how many gumballs he can buy with the total amount, assuming each gumball costs 25 cents.\n\nWe'll use Python to calculate the total value and then divide by the cost of a gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.\n\n```python\n# Define the value of each type of coin in cents\nquarter_value = 25\ndime_value = 10\nnickel_value = 5\npenny_value = 1\n\n# Define the number of each type of coin Colby has\nquarters = 8\ndimes = 6\nnickels = 14\npennies = 15\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money in cents\ntotal_cents = (quarters * quarter_value) + (dimes * dime_value) + (nickels * nickel_value) + (pennies * penny_value)\n\n# Assume the cost of each gumball is 25 cents\ngumball_cost = 25\n\n# Calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy\ngumballs = total_cents // gumball_cost\n\n# Print the result\nprint(gumballs)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the number of gumballs Colby can buy with his coins. Let's find the result."
