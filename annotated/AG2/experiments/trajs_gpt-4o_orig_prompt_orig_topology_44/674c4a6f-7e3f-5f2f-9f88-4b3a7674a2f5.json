You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We can solve this straightforwardly using Python. Here's the program to calculate the average:\n\n```python\n# Import the fractions module to handle the average in fraction form if needed\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Given test scores\nscores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the scores\ntotal_score = sum(scores)\n\n# Number of tests\nnumber_of_tests = len(scores)\n\n# Calculate the average score in fraction form\naverage_score = Fraction(total_score, number_of_tests)\n\n# Print the average score\nprint(average_score)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us Wilson's current math grade as a fraction, which can then be interpreted as the final answer."
