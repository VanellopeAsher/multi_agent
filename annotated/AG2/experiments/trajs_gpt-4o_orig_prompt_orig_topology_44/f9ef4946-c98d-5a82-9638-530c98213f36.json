On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Frankie spent watching TV during the week based on the information provided for each day. This can be solved directly by calculating the sum of time for each day.\n\nLet's break it down day by day and calculate the total:\n\n1. **Monday and Tuesday**: \n   - He watches 1 hour each day.\n   - Total for Monday and Tuesday = 1 + 1 = 2 hours.\n\n2. **Wednesday**:\n   - He watches three 30-minute episodes.\n   - Total for Wednesday = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n\n3. **Thursday**:\n   - He watches an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.\n   - Total for Thursday = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n\n4. **Friday**:\n   - He watches two one-hour episodes.\n   - Total for Friday = 2 * 1 = 2 hours.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total hours for the entire week:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Hours} = (\\text{Monday and Tuesday}) + (\\text{Wednesday}) + (\\text{Thursday}) + (\\text{Friday})\n\\]\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result:\n\n```python\n# Calculate total hours\nmonday_and_tuesday = 1 + 1  # 1 hour each\nwednesday = 3 * 0.5  # 3 episodes, 30 minutes each\nthursday = 1 + 0.5   # 1 hour + 30 minutes\nfriday = 2 * 1       # 2 episodes, 1 hour each\n\ntotal_hours = monday_and_tuesday + wednesday + thursday + friday\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give the total number of hours Frankie watched TV in the week. The output should be wrapped in a box as per mathematical convention:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]"

To express the total television hours in integer form, we can use Python's `Rational` from the `sympy` library to ensure the output is a fraction or an integer:\n\nLet's refactor the code to ensure the output format is not decimal:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate total hours using Rational to avoid decimal representation\nmonday_and_tuesday = Rational(1) + Rational(1)  # 1 hour each\nwednesday = 3 * Rational(1, 2)  # 3 episodes, 30 minutes each (1/2 hour each)\nthursday = Rational(1) + Rational(1, 2)   # 1 hour + 30 minutes (1/2 hour)\nfriday = 2 * Rational(1)       # 2 episodes, 1 hour each\n\ntotal_hours = monday_and_tuesday + wednesday + thursday + friday\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nRunning the revised code will give the result directly as a rational number without the decimal representation, ensuring that it matches the expected format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]"
