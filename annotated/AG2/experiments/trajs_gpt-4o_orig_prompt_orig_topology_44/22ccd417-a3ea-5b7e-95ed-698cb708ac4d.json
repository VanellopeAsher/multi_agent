You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses.

Let's denote the amount of one medicine per dose as \\( x \\) mL.\n2. Then, the amount of the second medicine per dose would be \\( 3x \\) mL.\n3. The total medicine per dose is \\( x + 3x = 4x \\) mL.\n4. We're given that 8 doses contain a total of 448 mL, so each dose contains \\( \\frac{448}{8} = 56 \\) mL.\n5. Therefore, we have the equation \\( 4x = 56 \\).\n\nWe can solve this equation to find \\( x \\), the amount of one medicine in each dose.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# The equation based on the given conditions\nequation = Eq(4*x, 56)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f\"The amount of one medicine per dose is: {solution[0]} mL\")\n```\n\nThis code will give us the desired amount of one medicine Saanvi uses per dose."
