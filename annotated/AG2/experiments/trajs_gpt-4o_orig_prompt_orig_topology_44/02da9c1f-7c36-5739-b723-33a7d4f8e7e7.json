You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMonica is wrapping Christmas gifts.

Determine the total number of gifts:\n   - Gifts for family: 6\n   - Gifts for friends: 4\n   - Gifts for teachers: 2\n\n   Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2\n\n2. Specify the total length of ribbon available.\n3. Calculate how many inches of ribbon can be used for each bow.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of gifts\ntotal_gifts = 6 + 4 + 2\n\n# Example total ribbon length in inches (e.g., 120 inches)\ntotal_ribbon_length = 120\n\n# Calculate inches of ribbon per gift bow as a rational number\nribbon_per_gift_bow = Rational(total_ribbon_length, total_gifts)\n\n# Display the result\nprint(ribbon_per_gift_bow)\n```\n\nIf you provide me with the total ribbon length available, I can adjust this example according to the actual problem constraints."
