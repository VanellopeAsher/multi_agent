You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\n48 people are riding a bus.

Start with 48 passengers on the bus.\n2. At the first stop:\n   - 8 passengers get off.\n   - 5 times that number, i.e., \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\), get on.\n   - Then, 2 passengers who just got on decide to get off.\n3. At the second stop:\n   - 21 passengers get off.\n   - 3 times fewer passengers than 21 get on, which means \\(\\frac{21}{3} = 7\\).\n\nNow let's implement this in Python to get the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Initial number of passengers\npassengers = 48\n\n# First stop\npassengers -= 8  # 8 get off\npassengers += 8 * 5  # 5 times 8 get on\npassengers -= 2  # 2 who just got on decide to get off\n\n# Second stop\npassengers -= 21  # 21 get off\npassengers += 21 // 3  # 3 times fewer than 21 get on, which is 7\n\n# Printing the final count of passengers\nprint(passengers)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop."
