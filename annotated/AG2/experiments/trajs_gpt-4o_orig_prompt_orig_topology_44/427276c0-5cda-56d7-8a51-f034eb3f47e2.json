You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average height of the heels that the women are wearing at the cocktail party. We will apply the concept of weighted average to find the solution.\n\nHere's why it's a straightforward calculation that we can solve directly with Python:\n\n1. We have two groups of women with different heel heights.\n2. We know the number of women in each group and the height of the heels they are wearing.\n3. Our task is to find the average height of all the heels combined.\n\nTherefore, this is Case 1: We can write a Python program to solve it directly.\n\nLet's calculate the average heel height.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total height of each type of heel\ntotal_height_45_inch = 3 * 4.5  # Three women wearing 4.5-inch heels\ntotal_height_25_inch = 3 * 2.5  # Three women wearing 2.5-inch heels\n\n# Calculate the total number of heels\ntotal_women = 3 + 3\n\n# Calculate the average height\naverage_height = (total_height_45_inch + total_height_25_inch) / total_women\n\n# Using print to output the result in fractional form if necessary\nfrom sympy import Rational\naverage_height_fraction = Rational(average_height).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(f\"Average heel height: {average_height_fraction} inches\")\n```\n\nWe use the `Rational` class from the `sympy` package to express the average height as a fraction, maintaining the requirement to avoid decimals where applicable.\n\nRun this code to get the average height of the heels at the party."
