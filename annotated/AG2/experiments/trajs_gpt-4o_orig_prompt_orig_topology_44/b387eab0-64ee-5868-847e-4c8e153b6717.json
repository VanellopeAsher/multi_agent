      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow Case 1 and write a Python program. We need to calculate the total cost after applying the cashback and then the 10% discount.\n\nThe steps to solve this problem are as follows:\n1. Calculate the initial total cost based on the price per gallon and the number of gallons.\n2. Calculate the total cashback.\n3. Subtract the cashback from the initial total cost.\n4. Apply the 10% discount on the remaining cost after cashback.\n5. Print the final cost.\n\nLet's write the Python code for these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial data\nprice_per_gallon = Rational(3)  # $3.00 per gallon\ngallons = 10\ncashback_per_gallon = Rational(0.20)  # $0.20 cashback per gallon\ndiscount_rate = Rational(0.10)  # 10% discount\n\n# Calculate initial total cost\ninitial_total_cost = price_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Calculate total cashback\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Calculate cost after cashback\ncost_after_cashback = initial_total_cost - total_cashback\n\n# Apply discount\ntotal_cost_after_discount = cost_after_cashback * (1 - discount_rate)\n\n# Print final cost in fractional form\nprint(total_cost_after_discount)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final amount the buyer needs to pay after applying both the cashback and the discount."
