You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there.

There are 2000 helmets.\n2. The number of robots is half the number of helmets.\n3. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs.\n\nBased on these relationships, we can calculate the number of robots and footballs. Here's how we can solve this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# Calculate number of robots (half of helmets)\nrobots = helmets // 2\n\n# Calculate number of footballs (twice the number of helmets)\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\n# Calculate total number of items\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\n\n# Output the result in the required form\nprint(total_items)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we will get the total number of items Dominick saw. I will execute this code."
