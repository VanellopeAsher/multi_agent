You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

Calculate the total number of wheels needed for all the cars. Since each car requires 4 wheels, the number of wheels needed for 57 cars is \\(57 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. Calculate the total number of wheels needed for all the motorcycles. Since each motorcycle requires 2 wheels, the number of wheels needed for 73 motorcycles is \\(73 \\times 2\\).\n\n3. Add the wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed.\n\n4. Since 276 wheels are left after assembling all the toys, the initial number of wheels in the box is the sum of the total wheels needed and the remaining wheels.\n\nLet's calculate using Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing the sympy module for symbolic math\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the number of cars and motorcycles\nnum_cars = 57\nnum_motorcycles = 73\n\n# Calculate total wheels needed for the cars\nwheels_cars = num_cars * 4\n\n# Calculate total wheels needed for the motorcycles\nwheels_motorcycles = num_motorcycles * 2\n\n# Calculate total wheels needed\ntotal_wheels_needed = wheels_cars + wheels_motorcycles\n\n# Define the number of remaining wheels\nremaining_wheels = 276\n\n# Define the total initial wheels in the box\ninitial_wheels = symbols('initial_wheels')\n\n# The equation to find the initial wheels\nequation = Eq(initial_wheels - total_wheels_needed, remaining_wheels)\n\n# Solve the equation\ninitial_wheels_value = solve(equation, initial_wheels)[0]\n\nprint(initial_wheels_value)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and output the initial number of wheels in the box before Henry started assembling the toys."

Calculate the total number of wheels for 73 motorcycles:\n   \\[\n   73 \\times 2 = 146\n   \\]\n\n3. Add the wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles:\n   \\[\n   228 + 146 = 374\n   \\]\n\n4.
