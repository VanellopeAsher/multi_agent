Since there are 200 kids divided equally into two groups, there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n2. Calculate the total number of seashells the boys collected. Each boy collected 600 shells, so together they collected \\( 100 \\times 600 = 60000 \\) shells.\n3. Calculate the number of seashells each girl collected. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:\n   \\[\n   60000 + 4 \\times 60000 = 60000 + 240000 = 300000\n   \\]\n4. Finally, calculate how many seashells each girl brought by dividing the total number of seashells collected by the girls by the number of girls, which is 100.\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of boys and girls\nboys = 100\ngirls = 100\n\n# Seashells each boy brings\nshells_per_boy = 600\n\n# Total shells brought by boys\ntotal_boys_shells = boys * shells_per_boy\n\n# Total shells brought by girls (boys' total+ 4 times boys' total)\ntotal_girls_shells = total_boys_shells + 4 * total_boys_shells\n\n# Shells brought by each girl\nshells_per_girl = total_girls_shells / girls\n\n# Using fractions to avoid decimals\nshells_per_girl = Rational(shells_per_girl)\n\n# Output the number of shells each girl collects\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the number of seashells each girl collected. Let's compute:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3000}\n\\]\n\nThus, each girl collected 3000 seashells."

According to the problem, the girls collected an amount equal to what the boys collected and four times what the boys collected. Therefore, the total number of seashells collected by the girls is:\n   \\[\n   60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000\n   \\]\n3. Since there are 100 girls, the number of seashells each girl collected is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of seashells each girl collected is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3000}\n\\] \n\nThis concludes the solution to the problem, with each girl having collected 3000 seashells."
