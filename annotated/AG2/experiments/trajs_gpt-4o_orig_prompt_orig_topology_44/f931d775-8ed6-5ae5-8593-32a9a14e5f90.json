  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of lines Sean has to memorize by considering the lines from his song and both scenes. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Number of Lines Sean Has in Each Part**:\n   - **Solo Song**: Sean has to memorize all 54 lines.\n   - **First Scene**: \n     - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which means it has \\( 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\) lines.\n     - A third of these are Sean's lines, so Sean's lines are \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36 \\).\n   - **Second Scene**:\n     - The second scene has six more lines than the song, making it \\( 54 + 6 = 60 \\) lines.\n     - Four-fifths of the second scene are Sean's lines, i.e., \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\).\n     - Since Sean also needs to memorize 15 additional lines due to another actor's unavailability, we add those lines to his total.\n     - Total lines for the second scene that Sean has to memorize are \\( 48 + 15 = 63 \\).\n\n2. **Add Up All of Sean's Lines**:\n   - Total lines Sean has to memorize is the sum of all the lines from the solo song, his lines in the first scene, and the lines he needs to memorize in the second scene:\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python using sympy for any necessary symbolic manipulation (though it is straightforward arithmetic in this case):\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Lines in the solo song\nsolo_song_lines = 54\n\n# Lines in the first scene and Sean's share\nfirst_scene_total_lines = 2 * solo_song_lines\nfirst_scene_sean_lines = Rational(1, 3) * first_scene_total_lines\n\n# Lines in the second scene and Sean's share\nsecond_scene_total_lines = solo_song_lines + 6\nsecond_scene_sean_lines = Rational(4, 5) * second_scene_total_lines\n\n# Additional lines memorized by Sean due to another actor's absence\nadditional_lines = 15\n\n# Total lines Sean has to memorize\ntotal_lines = solo_song_lines + first_scene_sean_lines + second_scene_sean_lines + additional_lines\n\n# Output the total number of lines in fraction form\nprint(f\"Total lines Sean has to memorize: {total_lines}\")\n```\n\nRun this code to calculate the total number of lines Sean must memorize. \\(\\boxed{153}\\) lines."
