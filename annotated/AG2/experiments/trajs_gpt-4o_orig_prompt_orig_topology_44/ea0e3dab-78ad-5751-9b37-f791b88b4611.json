You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month.

Since the problem can be solved with a simple programming calculation, we'll use Case 1 to solve it directly. \n\nHere's the key idea:\n- For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena is charged $200 per month.\n- For the second half of the year (6 months), she is charged 15% less than the regular amount.\n\nThe calculation can be represented as follows:\n1. Payment for the first 6 months: \\(6 \\times 200\\)\n2. Reduced monthly charge for the next 6 months: \\(200 \\times (1 - 0.15)\\)\n3. Payment for the next 6 months with the reduced charge: \\(6 \\times \\text{reduced monthly charge}\\)\n4. Total amount paid is the sum of both 6-month periods.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Fixed monthly charge\nmonthly_charge = 200\n\n# Monthly charge with 15% discount\ndiscounted_monthly_charge = monthly_charge * Rational(85, 100)  # 85% = 100% - 15%\n\n# Total payment for first 6 months\nfirst_half_payment = 6 * monthly_charge\n\n# Total payment for second 6 months\nsecond_half_payment = 6 * discounted_monthly_charge\n\n# Total annual payment\ntotal_payment = first_half_payment + second_half_payment\n\nprint(total_payment)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year in a fraction form."
