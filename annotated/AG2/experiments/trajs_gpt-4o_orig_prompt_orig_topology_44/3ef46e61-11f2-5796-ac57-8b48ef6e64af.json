You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

This problem can be solved directly with Python by calculating the total minutes worked each day, dividing by the time taken per call, and summing up for the week.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\n# Number of hours Tim works from Monday to Thursday\nhours_mon_thu = 6\n# Number of minutes Tim spends per call\nminutes_per_call = 15\n# Number of hours Tim works on Friday\nhours_friday = 6 + 2  # additional 2 hours on Friday\n\n# Calculate the number of calls Tim handles each day from Monday to Thursday\ncalls_mon_thu = (hours_mon_thu * 60) // minutes_per_call\n\n# Calculate the number of calls Tim handles on Friday\ncalls_friday = (hours_friday * 60) // minutes_per_call\n\n# Total calls in the week\ntotal_calls = 4 * calls_mon_thu + calls_friday\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_calls)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate and print the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday."
