On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward approach of calculating Billy's and Sally's hourly wages over time and then determining how much each earns after working specific hours. Let's go through the solution step-by-step and use Python to compute the results.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate Billy's hourly wage after his two raises:\n- Initial rate: $10 per hour.\n- After 2 months, raise of $0.50/hour: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n- On his first anniversary, raise of $1.00/hour: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate Sally's hourly wage after her raise:\n- Starting salary: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n- After two months: $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the total amount earned by both Billy and Sally after working 20 hours at their respective wages.\n\nLet's implement this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Billy's wage\nbilly_initial_wage = 10\nbilly_first_raise = 0.50\nbilly_second_raise = 1.00\n\nbilly_final_wage = billy_initial_wage + billy_first_raise + billy_second_raise\n\n# Sally's wage\nsally_initial_wage = billy_initial_wage + 0.50\nsally_raise_after_2_months = 0.50\n\nsally_final_wage = sally_initial_wage + sally_raise_after_2_months\n\n# Calculate earnings for 20 hours\nbilly_earnings = 20 * billy_final_wage\nsally_earnings = 20 * sally_final_wage\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Print the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally after they both work for 20 hours.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]\n\nSo, Billy will earn $10 more than Sally."
