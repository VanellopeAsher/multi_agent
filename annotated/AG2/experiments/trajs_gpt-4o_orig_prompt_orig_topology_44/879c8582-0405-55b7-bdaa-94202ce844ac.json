She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has and how many cards she gives to her students. Then, we can use this information to find out how many students received the cards.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cards for each type of sports card collection.\n2. Sum up all the cards.\n3. Subtract the 50 cards Miss Maria keeps from the total.\n4. Determine the number of students by dividing the remaining cards by the number of cards each student receives.\n\nLet's write Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n\n# Calculate the total number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n\n# Number of rare soccer cards\nsoccer_cards = 30\n\n# Total cards Miss Maria has\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards + soccer_cards\n\n# Cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_given = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Cards each student receives\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Calculate number of students\nnumber_of_students = cards_given // cards_per_student\n\n# Print the number of students\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed, it will calculate the number of students who received cards from Miss Maria."
