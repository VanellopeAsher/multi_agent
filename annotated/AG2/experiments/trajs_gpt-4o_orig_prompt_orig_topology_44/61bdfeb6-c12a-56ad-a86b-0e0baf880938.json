You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSamwell owns an appliance store.

We will use Python to evaluate this.\n\nKey Idea: This problem can be solved through calculation, so it follows Case 1 where we use Python code directly. We'll calculate the quantities for each type of TV and subtract from the total to find the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\ntotal_tvs = 40\nsmart_tvs_fraction = Rational(1, 4)\nanalog_tvs_fraction = Rational(1, 8)\nprojection_tvs_fraction = Rational(1, 5)\n\n# Calculate the number of each type of TV sold\nsmart_tvs_sold = smart_tvs_fraction * total_tvs\nanalog_tvs_sold = analog_tvs_fraction * total_tvs\nprojection_tvs_sold = projection_tvs_fraction * total_tvs\n\n# Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold\noled_tvs_sold = total_tvs - (smart_tvs_sold + analog_tvs_sold + projection_tvs_sold)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(oled_tvs_sold)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the number of OLED TVs sold, using the fractions in terms of total TVs."
