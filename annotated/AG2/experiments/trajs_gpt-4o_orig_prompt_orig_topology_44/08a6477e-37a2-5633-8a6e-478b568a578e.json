Define variables:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of bandages used on the first day.\n   - Based on the problem, the number of bandages used on the second day is \\( x - 10 \\).\n   - The number of bandages used on the third day is \\( \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\), as half a pack of bandages is used.\n\n2. Set up the equation:\n   - Initially, there are 19 bandages.\n   - On the first day, they receive 50 bandages, so the total after ordering is \\( 19 + 50 = 69 \\).\n   - On the third day, they receive 2 bulk packs, which is 100 bandages, thus having \\( 69 - x - (x - 10) + 100 - 25 \\).\n   - They have 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\n3. Solve the equation for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve the equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\ninitial_bandages = 19\nfirst_day_order = 50\nthird_day_order_packs = 2\n\n# Total bandages at the start\ntotal_initial = initial_bandages + first_day_order\n\n# Bandages after third day orders\ntotal_after_orders = total_initial - x - (x - 10) + third_day_order_packs * 50 - 25\n\n# Equation with 78 bandages left\nequation = Eq(total_after_orders, 78)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code will solve for \\( x \\), the number of bandages used on the first day.
