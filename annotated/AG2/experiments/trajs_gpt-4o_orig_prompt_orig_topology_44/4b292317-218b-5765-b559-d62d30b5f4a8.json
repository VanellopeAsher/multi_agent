You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts.

Marty has a total of 10,000 millimeters of ribbon.\n2. First, he cuts this ribbon into 40 equal parts. We need to calculate the length of each part.\n3. Then, each of these 40 parts is divided into 50 equal pieces. We need to calculate the length of each final cut.\n\nWe will implement these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total length of the ribbon\ntotal_length_mm = 10000\n\n# First, cut into 40 equal parts\nfirst_cut_length = Rational(total_length_mm, 40)\n\n# Each of those parts is then cut into 50 equal parts\nfinal_cut_length = Rational(first_cut_length, 50)\n\n# Print the final length of each cut in fraction form\nprint(final_cut_length)\n```\n\nLet's compute these results."

First, we divide the total 10,000 millimeters of ribbon by 40 to get the length of each of the initial parts:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{First cut length} = \\frac{10000}{40} = 250 \\text{ millimeters}\n   \\]\n\n2. Then, we take each of these 250-millimeter parts and divide them into 50 equal pieces:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final cut length} = \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\text{ millimeters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of each final piece of ribbon is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) millimeters."
