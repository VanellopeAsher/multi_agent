  "problem": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.

Calculate the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum.\n2. Calculate the cost of the grape gum.\n3. Calculate the cost of the green apple gum.\n4. Sum these amounts to get the total cost.\n\nThis problem can be solved directly with Python code to find the total cost. Let's write the program:\n\n```python\n# Cost of each pack of strawberry gum\nstrawberry_cost_per_pack = 2\n\n# Total cost for two packs of strawberry gum\nstrawberry_total = 2 * strawberry_cost_per_pack\n\n# Cost of one pack of grape gum\ngrape_cost = 2\n\n# Cost of one pack of green apple gum, which is half the price of the grape gum\ngreen_apple_cost = grape_cost / 2\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = strawberry_total + grape_cost + green_apple_cost\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the total amount Suzie paid for all the gum packs, using the specified costs."
