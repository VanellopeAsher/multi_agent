You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKatherine has 50 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Katherine will incur filling all 50 hanging baskets with petunias and sweet potato vines. This problem can be solved directly by calculating the cost of each type of plant and summing them up.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of petunias needed: Since Katherine adds 30 petunias per basket and has 50 baskets, the total number of petunias is \\(30 \\times 50\\).\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for the petunias: Multiply the total number of petunias by the cost per petunia, which is $3.00.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed: Since she adds 20 vines per basket and has 50 baskets, the total number of sweet potato vines is \\(20 \\times 50\\).\n\n4. Calculate the total cost for the sweet potato vines: Multiply the total number of vines by the cost per vine, which is $2.50.\n\n5. Add the total cost of petunias and sweet potato vines to get the total expenditure.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total cost\n\n# Number of baskets\nbaskets = 50\n\n# Number of petunias and vines per basket\npetunias_per_basket = 30\nvines_per_basket = 20\n\n# Cost per petunia and per vine\ncost_per_petunia = 3.00\ncost_per_vine = 2.50\n\n# Total number of petunias and vines\ntotal_petunias = petunias_per_basket * baskets\ntotal_vines = vines_per_basket * baskets\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost_petunias = total_petunias * cost_per_petunia\ntotal_cost_vines = total_vines * cost_per_vine\n\n# Total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = total_cost_petunias + total_cost_vines\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_expenditure)\n```\n\nRun this code, and it will output the total amount Katherine will need to spend to fill all the baskets."
