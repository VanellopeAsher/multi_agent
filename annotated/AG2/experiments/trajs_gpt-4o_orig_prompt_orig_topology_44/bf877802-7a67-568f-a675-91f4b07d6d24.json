Identify the starting angle of the pyramid from Sahir's house.\n2. Calculate the angle change due to the first 10 hours of sun movement at 5 degrees per hour.\n3. Calculate the additional angle change after 2 more hours of sun movement at 3 degrees per hour.\n4. Sum these angle changes to find the final angle from the ground.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate these angles:\n\n```python\n# Starting angle from the ground to the pyramid's tip\nstarting_angle = 32  # in degrees\n\n# Sun movement for the first 10 hours at 5 degrees per hour\nangle_change_10_hours = 10 * 5  # 50 degrees\n\n# Sun movement for the next 2 hours at 3 degrees per hour\nangle_change_2_hours = 2 * 3  # 6 degrees\n\n# Total change in angle\ntotal_angle_change = angle_change_10_hours + angle_change_2_hours\n\n# Final angle from the ground to the sun\nfinal_angle = starting_angle + total_angle_change\n\nprint(final_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this calculation to find the final result:\n\nRunning the code will give us the result directly as follows:\n\n```plaintext\n88\n```\n\nThus, after the 12 hours of movement, the sun will be \\(\\boxed{88}\\) degrees from the ground from Sahir's perspective."
