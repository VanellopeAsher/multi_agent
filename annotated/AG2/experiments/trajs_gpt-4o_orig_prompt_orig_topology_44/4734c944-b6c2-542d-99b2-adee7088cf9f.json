You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to determine how much Peter spends each day, and how many action figures he buys throughout the week. We'll split the week into two parts: from Sunday to Wednesday and from Thursday to Saturday, tracking his expenditures and purchases for each part.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nWe'll calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures separately, as they have different costs, and then add the totals to find the number of action figures he has by the end of the week.\n\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate Daily Spending Amount:**\n   Since Peter wants to spend an equal amount each day and he has $70, he will be spending:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily Spend} = \\frac{70}{7} = 10 \\text{ dollars per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Purchase from Sunday to Wednesday:**\n   - **Cost per wooden action figure**: $5\n   - Days from Sunday to Wednesday: 4 days\n   - Peter buys wooden action figures at $5 each. Hence, each day he buys:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\text{ wooden action figures}\n     \\]\n   - Total wooden action figures for 4 days:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 2 = 8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Purchase from Thursday to Saturday:**\n   - **Cost per plastic action figure**: $2.5\n   - Days from Thursday to Saturday: 3 days\n   - Peter spends $10 each day, so he can buy:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{2.5} = 4 \\text{ plastic action figures}\n     \\]\n   - Total plastic action figures for 3 days:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 4 = 12\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Action Figures:**\n   Add the total number of each type of action figure:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ (wooden)} + 12 \\text{ (plastic)} = 20\n   \\]\n\nNow we will write a Python program to confirm this calculation using the package `sympy` for fractions/radical representation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total budget and days\ntotal_money = 70\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Daily spending\ndaily_spending = Rational(total_money, days_in_week)\n\n# Wooden action figures (Sunday to Wednesday)\nwooden_action_figure_cost = 5\nwooden_figures_per_day = daily_spending / wooden_action_figure_cost\ntotal_wooden_figures = wooden_figures_per_day * 4\n\n# Plastic action figures (Thursday to Saturday)\nplastic_action_figure_cost = 2.5\nplastic_figures_per_day = daily_spending / plastic_action_figure_cost\ntotal_plastic_figures = plastic_figures_per_day * 3\n\n# Total action figures\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\n# Print the result using fractions\nprint(total_action_figures)\n```\n\nThe total number of action figures by the end of the week is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
