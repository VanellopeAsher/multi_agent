You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pints of red paint were used given the conditions of the mural. We'll use a bit of reasoning and algebra here.\n\nKey Idea: This problem can be solved through reasoning and basic algebra without needing to write a Python program.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We know that the mural uses a total of 12 pints of paint.\n2. Half of this paint is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) pints.\n3. The remaining paint (which is the other half) is equally divided among red, white, and purple. So, the non-yellow part consists of \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\) pints.\n4. Since the red, white, and purple colors are used in equal amounts, we divide these 6 pints equally among the three colors.\n\nLet's perform this step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- Total paint = 12 pints\n- Yellow paint = 6 pints\n- Remaining paint (for red, white, purple) = \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\) pints\n- Each of red, white, and purple paint = \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints\n\nSo, 2 pints of red paint were used.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
