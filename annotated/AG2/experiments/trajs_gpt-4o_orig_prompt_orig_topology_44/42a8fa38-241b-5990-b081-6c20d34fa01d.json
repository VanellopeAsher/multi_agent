You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables.

      "content": "To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on purchasing the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost of the tomato seed packets and the total cost of the celery seed packets, then sum these amounts. This problem can be handled directly by elementary arithmetic calculations.\n\nLet's calculate the total expenditure:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:\n   - Number of tomato seed packets = 20\n   - Cost per tomato seed packet = $40\n   - Total cost for tomato seeds = \\(20 \\times 40\\)\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the celery seeds:\n   - Number of celery seed packets = 80\n   - Cost per celery seed packet = $30\n   - Total cost for celery seeds = \\(80 \\times 30\\)\n\n3. Add the total cost of tomato seeds and celery seeds to get the total expenditure.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the costs\ncost_of_tomato_seeds = 20 * 40\ncost_of_celery_seeds = 80 * 30\n\n# Calculate the total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = cost_of_tomato_seeds + cost_of_celery_seeds\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_expenditure)\n```\n\nExecuting this code would provide the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent, which we can then express in a boxed format as:\n\n\\(\\boxed{3200}\\)"
