You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we can use basic arithmetic to find the answer. Here's the key idea:\n\nCase 2 applies here, as it mostly involves reasoning. We know that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so they found a total of \\(30 + 30 = 60\\) eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. Let's denote the total number of eggs as \\(T\\).\n\nSince the twins found 60 eggs and 10 eggs were not found by anyone, the friends found the remaining eggs. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ T - (60 + 10) = \\text{{eggs found by friends}} \\]\n\nWe find the total number of eggs from the above equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{{eggs found by friends}} = T - 70 \\]\n\nSince the only undefined part in the problem concerns the total number of eggs, and given that they mention nothing else about the total being unknown or variable, it seems implied that what was supposed to be found is the number explicitly mentioned (the rest except 10). Therefore, the eggs found by the friends are those unaccounted for by the subtraction of 60 and subtracting those still not found.\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\nIf 10 eggs were not found by anyone, and we take that into consideration, the friends found:\n\nNumber of eggs found by friends: \\((T - 70)\\).\nWe now have, \\( \\text{{eggs found by friends}} = T - 70 \\).\n\nHere's how you can check if something was lost in the explanation:\n\nLet's consider that the 'eggs' found by friends were asked, by solving:\n\n\\[ 60 + \\text{{eggs found by friends}} + 10 = T \\]\n\nTherefore, just from direct output in reasoning, \\(\\boxed{T-70}\\) can be solved given any \\(T\\) if the total were given or believed differently explained as would the solution be enough to be direct on \\(T - 70 = \\boxed{\\text{{We should assume they found the eggs unaccounted for, not just listed}}}\\).\n\nAs the problem was presented, we would consider inflating \\(T\\) for those understood if required but directly from the explanation: \\(\\boxed{\\text{{what remains when accounting for 10 and the twins}}}\\)."
