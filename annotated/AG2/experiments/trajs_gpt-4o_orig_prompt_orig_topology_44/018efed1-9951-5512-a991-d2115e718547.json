You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.

This problem can be solved directly with a simple calculation.\n\nGiven:\n- Gerald earns $30 every day.\n- He worked for an entire week (7 days).\n- He saved a total of $110.\n\nTo find out how much he spent, we can use the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total earnings for the week.\n2. Determine the amount spent by subtracting the savings from the total earnings.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate total earnings in a week\ndaily_earning = 30\ndays_worked = 7\ntotal_earnings = daily_earning * days_worked\n\n# Calculate the amount spent\nsavings = 110\namount_spent = total_earnings - savings\n\n# Output the result\nprint(amount_spent)\n```\n\nPlease run this code to find out how much Gerald spent."

Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days, thus his total earnings for the week are:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 7 = 210 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. He saved $110 out of his earnings.\n\n3. The amount he spent is the total earnings minus the savings:\n   \\[\n   210 - 110 = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the amount Gerald spent is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) dollars."
