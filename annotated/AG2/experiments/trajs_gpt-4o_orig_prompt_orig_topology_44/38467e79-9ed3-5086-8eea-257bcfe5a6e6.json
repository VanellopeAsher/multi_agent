You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home.

We know that two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-third of the students do not have a desktop computer. We also know that the number of students who do not have a computer is 30.\n\nWe'll set up an equation to solve for the total number of students, \\( x \\), at the grade level. Since one-third of them do not have a desktop computer, one-third of the total number of students is 30.\n\nHereâ€™s how we will solve it:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times x = 30\n\\]\n\nLet's use Python to solve this equation and find the number of students.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(1/3 * x, 30)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nExecute this code to find the total number of students, which is the solution to our problem. After running the code provided, you will find that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 90 students at that grade level."
