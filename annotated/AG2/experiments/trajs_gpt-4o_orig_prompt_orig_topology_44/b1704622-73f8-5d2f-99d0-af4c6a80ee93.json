You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours.

Let's follow the steps below:\n\n1. Define the hours worked each day based on the problem statement:\n   - Hours on Tuesday: 5 hours\n   - Hours on Wednesday: Double the hours of Tuesday\n   - Hours on Thursday: 2 hours less than Wednesday's hours\n\n2. Calculate the total number of hours worked over the three days.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of hours Bruce worked each day\ntuesday_hours = 5\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# Calculate the total hours over the three days\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days."
