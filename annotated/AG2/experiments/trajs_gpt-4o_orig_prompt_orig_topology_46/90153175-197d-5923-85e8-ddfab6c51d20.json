You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we want to determine the total number of eggs Claire will consume over 12 weeks and then convert that number into dozens of eggs. Each dozen contains 12 eggs.\n\nHere's the detailed approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in 12 weeks.\n2. Multiply the number of days by 3 (since Claire uses 3 eggs per day).\n3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens by dividing by 12.\n\nLet's use Python to compute:\n\n```python\n# Number of weeks\nweeks = 12\n\n# Number of days in 12 weeks\ndays = weeks * 7\n\n# Eggs consumed per day\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# Total eggs consumed in 12 weeks\ntotal_eggs = days * eggs_per_day\n\n# Convert eggs to dozens\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / 12\n\nfrom sympy import Rational\n# Output result\nprint(Rational(dozens_of_eggs))\n```\n\nThis code will output the number of dozens of eggs in fractional form."
