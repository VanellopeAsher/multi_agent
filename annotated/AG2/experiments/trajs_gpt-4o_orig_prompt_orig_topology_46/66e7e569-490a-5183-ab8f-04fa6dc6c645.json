You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

Given that 60 potatoes yield 360 hash browns, we want to find out how many hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe can set up a proportion based on the given ratio and solve for the unknown:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{360} = \\frac{960}{x}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of hash browns we can make from 960 potatoes.\n\n### Solution\nLet's write a Python program to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the proportion\nequation = Eq(60 / 360, 960 / x)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nLet's calculate this."
