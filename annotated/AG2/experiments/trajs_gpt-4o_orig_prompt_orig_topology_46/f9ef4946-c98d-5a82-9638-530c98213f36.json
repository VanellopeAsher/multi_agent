On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.

We will calculate the total by explicitly adding up the amounts for each day.\n\nLet's write a program to calculate the total number of hours:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the time spent watching TV each day\nmonday_hours = 1  # 1 hour\ntuesday_hours = 1  # 1 hour\nwednesday_hours = 3 * Rational(30, 60)  # 3 episodes of 30 minutes each\nthursday_hours = 1 + Rational(30, 60)  # 1 hour + 30 minutes\nfriday_hours = 2 * 1  # 2 one-hour episodes\n\n# Calculate the total hours watched\ntotal_hours = monday_hours + tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours + friday_hours\n\n# Print the result in fractional form\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nThis program calculates the total hours Frankie watched TV from Monday to Friday based on the described schedule. It utilizes the `Rational` class from `sympy` to ensure proper handling of fractions."
