You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn goes shopping and buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

      "content": "The key idea is to calculate the total cost John incurs, taking into account the tax applied to nonfood items. We'll categorize the items into food and nonfood, apply the tax to nonfood items, and then sum the costs.\n\nLet's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Identify food and nonfood items:\n   - Food: milk, eggs, cookies, water\n   - Nonfood: light bulbs, cups, roach traps\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of food items directly, since the tax does not apply to them.\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of nonfood items and apply the 10% tax to them.\n\n4. Sum the cost of food items and the taxed cost of nonfood items to get the total cost.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python using the specified format:\n\n```python\n# Importing the sympy package\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices\nmilk = 2  # dollars\neggs = 3  # dollars\nlight_bulbs = 3  # dollars\ncups = 3  # dollars\nroach_traps = 4  # dollars\ncookies = 2  # dollars\nwater = 1  # dollars\n\n# Tax rate\ntax_rate = Rational(10, 100)  # 10% tax\n\n# Total cost for food items\nfood_cost = milk + eggs + cookies + water\n\n# Total cost for nonfood items\nnonfood_cost = light_bulbs + cups + roach_traps\n\n# Total tax on nonfood items\ntax_on_nonfood = nonfood_cost * tax_rate\n\n# Total cost including tax on nonfood items\ntotal_cost = food_cost + nonfood_cost + tax_on_nonfood\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses the `sympy` package for precise fraction arithmetic, ensuring results are in fractions rather than decimals as requested."
