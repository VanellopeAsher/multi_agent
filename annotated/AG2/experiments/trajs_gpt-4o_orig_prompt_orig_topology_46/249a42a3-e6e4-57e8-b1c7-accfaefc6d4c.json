You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.\n2. Calculate the number of off days using the given percentage.\n3. Calculate the number of working days by subtracting the off days from the total days.\n4. Calculate the number of people Billy can help per working day.\n5. Multiply the number of working days by the number of people helped per day to get the total number of people helped.\n\nLet's follow these steps and use Python to perform the necessary calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.\ndays_in_march = 31\ndays_in_april = 19\ntotal_days = days_in_march + days_in_april\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of off days.\noff_days_percentage = Rational(20, 100)\noff_days = total_days * off_days_percentage\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of working days.\nworking_days = total_days - off_days\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of people Billy can help per working day.\nhours_per_day = 3.5\npeople_per_hour = 2\npeople_per_day = hours_per_day * people_per_hour\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total number of people helped.\ntotal_people_helped = working_days * people_per_day\n\n# Output the result.\nprint(total_people_helped)\n```\n\nRun this Python code to find out how many people Billy helps."
