      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount paid for gas after applying the cashback and the discount coupon. Here's how we can approach this problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the Initial Cost:** First, determine the cost of 10 gallons of gas without any discounts or cashbacks.\n\n2. **Apply Cashback:** Calculate the total cashback by multiplying the cashback offer per gallon by the number of gallons.\n\n3. **Calculate Cost After Cashback:** Subtract the cashback from the initial cost.\n\n4. **Apply Coupon Discount:** Apply the 10% discount on the price after cashback.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the final price.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Variables\ngallon_price = 3.00  # cost per gallon\ngallons = 10  # total gallons purchased\ncashback_per_gallon = 0.20  # cashback per gallon\ndiscount_rate = 0.10  # 10% discount\n\n# Calculate initial total cost\ninitial_cost = gallon_price * gallons\n\n# Calculate total cashback\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Cost after cashback\ncost_after_cashback = initial_cost - total_cashback\n\n# Apply the discount\nfinal_cost = cost_after_cashback * (1 - discount_rate)\n\n# Print the final cost in fractional form\nprint(Rational(final_cost))\n```\n\nRunning this script will give us the final cost the customer needs to pay.\n\nLet's evaluate it step by step according to the provided details:\n1. The initial cost for 10 gallons at $3.00 each is \\(10 \\times 3.00 = $30.00\\).\n2. Total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 each is \\(10 \\times 0.20 = $2.00\\).\n3. Cost after cashback is \\(30.00 - 2.00 = $28.00\\).\n4. Applying the 10% discount, the final cost becomes \\(28.00 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 28.00 \\times 0.90 = $25.20\\).\n\nThus, the final cost is \\(\\boxed{\\$25.20}\\)."
