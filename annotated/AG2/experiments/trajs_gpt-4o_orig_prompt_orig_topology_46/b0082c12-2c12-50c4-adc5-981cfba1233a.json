You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nLeah just got a new kitten.

Apply the 10% discount to the vaccine cost.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the vases broken by the kitten.\n4. Add up all the costs: spaying, discounted vaccine cost, and vase cost.\n\nLetâ€™s implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy to handle fractions if needed, but it's likely not necessary here\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Known costs\ncost_spay = 200\ncost_per_vaccine = 20\nnumber_of_vaccines = 3\ndiscount_rate = 0.10\ncost_per_vase = 12\nnumber_of_vases_broken = 4\n\n# Calculating total vaccine cost with discount\ntotal_vaccine_cost = cost_per_vaccine * number_of_vaccines\ndiscounted_vaccine_cost = total_vaccine_cost * (1 - discount_rate)\n\n# Calculating total vase cost\ntotal_vase_cost = cost_per_vase * number_of_vases_broken\n\n# Calculating total cost so far\ntotal_cost = cost_spay + discounted_vaccine_cost + total_vase_cost\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and output the total cost Leah's kitten has incurred so far.\n\nRunning this code will give us the total cost Leah has incurred.
