You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of each colored square (red, blue, green, and white) on Brittany's comforter, and then find how many fewer white squares there are than green squares.\n\nWe can approach this problem with Case 1: solve it using Python code because we can directly calculate the numbers by expressing them in terms of a set of linear equations.\n\nHere's how we will solve it step by step:\n\n1. Define the number of red squares, blue squares, green squares, and white squares.\n2. Use the relationships given:\n   - Blue squares are 4 more than red squares.\n   - Green squares are 6 more than blue squares.\n   - Set up the equation that the total number of squares is equal to 68. \n3. Solve for each unknown (number of each colored square).\n4. Calculate how many fewer white squares there are than green squares.\n\nLet's write the Python code to handle this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define symbols for the number of each type of colored square\nr, b, g, w = symbols('r b g w', integer=True)\n\n# Given relationships:\n# Number of red squares\nr_squares = 14\n\n# Blue squares are 4 more than red squares\nb_squares = r_squares + 4\n\n# Green squares are 6 more than blue squares\ng_squares = b_squares + 6\n\n# Total number of squares is 68\ntotal_squares = 68\n\n# Equation to find the number of white squares\neq = Eq(r_squares + b_squares + g_squares + w, total_squares)\n\n# Solve the equation for w (white squares)\nsolution = solve(eq, w)\nw_squares = solution[0]\n\n# Calculate how many fewer white squares than green squares\nfewer_squares = g_squares - w_squares\n\n# Output the result\nprint(fewer_squares)\n```\n\nBy executing this code, we will find out how much fewer the number of white squares is compared to the green squares."
