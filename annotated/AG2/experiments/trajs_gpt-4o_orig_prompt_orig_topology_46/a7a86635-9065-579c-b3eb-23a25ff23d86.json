You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought back. Let's follow the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the distribution of kids and seashells:**\n   - There are 200 kids, equally divided into boys and girls. Therefore, there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n   - Each boy brought back 600 shells.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of shells brought by boys:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells by boys} = 100 \\times 600\n   \\]\n\n3. **Understand the seashell contribution by girls:**\n   - The total number of seashells brought by the girls is equal to the seashells brought by boys plus four times that amount.\n\n4. **Formulate the expression for the number of shells each girl brings:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells by girls} = \\text{Total shells by boys} + 4 \\times \\text{Total shells by boys}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells by girls} = 5 \\times \\text{Total shells by boys}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**\n   - If each girl brings back the same number of seashells, the number of seashells per girl can be calculated by dividing the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls (100).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Variables\ntotal_kids = 200\ntotal_boys = total_kids // 2  # Since they are divided equally into two groups\nboys_shells_per_boy = 600\n\n# Total shells brought by boys\ntotal_shells_by_boys = total_boys * boys_shells_per_boy\n\n# Total shells brought by girls (equal to boys shells + 4 times boys shells)\ntotal_shells_by_girls = 5 * total_shells_by_boys\n\n# Shells brought by each girl\ngirls_shells_per_girl = total_shells_by_girls / total_boys\n\nprint(girls_shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will provide the solution, which indicates how many seashells each girl brought back."
