You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSeth is twice as old as Brooke.

Thus, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     (x + 3) + (2x + 3) = 36\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   Let's solve this equation to find the current ages.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq((x + 3) + (2*x + 3), 36)\n\n# Solve the equation\nbrooke_age = solve(equation, x)[0]\nseth_age = 2 * brooke_age\n\nprint(seth_age)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the solution for Seth's current age.

The calculations show that Seth is currently 20 years old.\n\nTo break it down:\n\n- We defined \\( x \\) as Brooke's current age.\n- Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is \\( 2x \\).\n- Solving the equation:\n  \\[\n  (x + 3) + (2x + 3) = 36\n  \\]\n  simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  3x + 6 = 36\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3x = 30\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = 10\n  \\]\n\nThus, Brooke is 10 years old, and Seth, being twice as old, is \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\).\n\nThe solution in the box is: \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
