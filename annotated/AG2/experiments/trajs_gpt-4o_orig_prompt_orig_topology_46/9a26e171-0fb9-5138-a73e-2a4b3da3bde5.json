You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home.

We'll formulate an equation based on the problem statement and solve it using the `sympy` package.\n\n### Key Idea:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of students at that grade level.\n2. Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is \\(\\frac{1}{4}x\\).\n3. We're given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this number represents one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer. Therefore, the total number of students who do not have either device is \\( 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\).\n\nSo, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}x = 60 + n\n\\]\n\nWhere in our case \\( n = 0 \\) since all students without a desktop already account for those without both devices, due to current information.\n\nLet's use Python to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation based on the problem\nequation = Eq(1/4 * x, 60)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the result in fraction form\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nNow, let's solve this to find the total number of students at that grade level."
