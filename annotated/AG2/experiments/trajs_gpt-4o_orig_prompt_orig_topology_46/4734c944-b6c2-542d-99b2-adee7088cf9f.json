You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

Calculate the daily spending limit.\n2. Determine the number of wooden action figures Peter can buy from Sunday to Wednesday.\n3. Calculate the remaining budget for the rest of the week.\n4.

Let's carefully go through the problem again to determine the total number of action figures Peter can buy.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to:\n\n1. Determine how much Peter spends each day.\n2. Calculate how many days Peter spends buying each type of action figure.\n3. Find out how many action figures of each type he can buy based on his equal daily budget.\n\nLet's re-evaluate this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the daily spending limit.\n\nPeter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days). So, his daily spending limit is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Daily Spending} = \\frac{70}{7} = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of wooden action figures purchased.\n\nFrom Sunday to Wednesday (4 days), Peter buys wooden action figures costing $5 each.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Action figures per day} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n\\]\n\nIn 4 days, he buys:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total wooden action figures} = 4 \\times 2 = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of plastic action figures purchased.\n\nFrom Thursday to Saturday (3 days), Peter buys plastic action figures costing $2.5 each.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Action figures per day} = \\frac{10}{2.5} = 4\n\\]\n\nIn 3 days, he buys:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total plastic action figures} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total number of action figures.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total action figures} = 8 + 12 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, Peter will have a total of \\(\\boxed{20}\\) action figures by the end of the week."
