You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "**Key Idea:**\n\nThis problem is straightforward and involves using simple arithmetic to find the solution. We'll use a reverse calculation method to find Mark's initial weight before he started losing weight.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be Mark's initial weight. Given that he lost 10 pounds per month and ended up weighing 70 pounds, we can establish the following relationship:\n\n\\[ x - 10n = 70 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of months Mark was unwell. To solve this, we need to know the value of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is provided or can be determined from additional context, we can plug it into our equation to find \\( x \\).\n\nSince \\( n \\) is not provided here, let's set up our approach to finding \\( x \\) given various plausible scenarios for \\( n \\). Let's assume this information was intended to be given or determined separately.\n\nTherefore, we approach solving this as a single problem computation where time period \\( n \\) needs consideration:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx, n = symbols('x n')\n\n# Equation: initial weight - 10 pounds per month * number of months = final weight\nequation = Eq(x - 10 * n, 70)\n\n# Solve for x in terms of n\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the equation symbolically, allowing us to compute the initial weight for various values of \\( n \\). To actually determine a numeric initial weight, information regarding the specific duration \\( n \\) is required."

You've calculated the expression for Mark's initial weight using the equation \\( x - 10n = 70 \\).\n\nWith the equation rearranged to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 10n + 70 \\]\n\nSo, Mark's initial weight is expressed as \\( 10n + 70 \\). This means that depending on the duration \\( n \\) Mark was unwell, his initial weight would be 70 pounds plus 10 times the number of months he lost weight.\n\nFor a specific number of months \\( n \\), you can directly substitute it into the expression to find the initial weight."

      "content": "Since we've derived the formula for Mark's initial weight as \\( x = 10n + 70 \\), we need to know the duration \\( n \\) of his weight loss to compute the initial weight numerically.\n\nSince the problem does not specify the number of months, letâ€™s assume \\( n \\), request the value, or make an assumption for demonstration. Here, without specific \\( n \\), the formula itself is our current endpoint:\n\n\\[ x = 10n + 70 \\]\n\nIf \\( n = 0 \\) (no weight loss occurred), the initial weight is simply:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]\n\nTypically, you would substitute any known value for \\( n \\) to find the initial weight. Each scenario would yield a different weight:\n\n1. For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( x = 10 \\times 1 + 70 = 80 \\)\n2. For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( x = 10 \\times 2 + 70 = 90 \\)\n3. For \\( n = 3 \\): \\( x = 10 \\times 3 + 70 = 100 \\)\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nIf further detail arises specifying \\( n \\) or requesting a specific scenario, you can promptly substitute and calculate. Without it, we've expressed a general solution \\(\\boxed{10n + 70}\\)."
