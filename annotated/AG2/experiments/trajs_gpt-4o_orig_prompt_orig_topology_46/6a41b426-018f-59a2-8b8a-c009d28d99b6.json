You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "**Key Idea:** We need to determine how fast John runs in miles per day based on his weekly mileage. This is a straightforward calculation problem that can be directly solved with Python code.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n- John runs 60 miles a week.\n- He runs on 3 days, with twice the distance on one day compared to each of the other two days.\n\nIf we assume the amounts he runs on those two days are both \\(x\\), then the amount he runs on the one day he doubles that distance will be \\(2x\\).\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[ x + x + 2x = 60 \\]\n\nWe'll solve for \\(x\\) to find the amount he runs on the two days, and \\(2x\\) will be the miles for the third day.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation: x + x + 2x = 60\nequation = Eq(x + x + 2*x, 60)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Calculate the distances John runs each day\nfirst_day_run = solution[0] * 2\nother_day_run = solution[0]\n\n# Print the result in fraction form\nprint(f\"On two days, John runs: {other_day_run} miles each.\")\nprint(f\"On the third day, John runs: {first_day_run} miles.\")\n```\n\nThis code will solve for \\(x\\), giving us both the distance he runs on the two equal days and on the day he runs more. Let's evaluate this to get the correct result."
