You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark has $50.5 in his bank account.

The main idea is to determine how many days it will take for Mark to save enough money to buy the bike.\n\nHere's the logical step-by-step approach:\n1. Calculate the difference between the cost of the bike and Mark's current savings.\n2. Determine how many days it will take for Mark to earn this amount by dividing the difference by his daily earnings.\n\nWe can directly implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Initial amount in Mark's bank account\ncurrent_savings = 50.5\n\n# Daily earnings\ndaily_earnings = 12.5\n\n# Cost of the bike\nbike_cost = 300.5\n\n# Let 'days' be the number of days required to save enough money\ndays = symbols('days')\n\n# Setup the equation\n# current_savings + daily_earnings * days = bike_cost\nequation = current_savings + daily_earnings * days - bike_cost\n\n# Solve for number of days\ndays_needed = solve(equation, days)\n\nprint(days_needed[0])\n```\n\nNow, run this code to find out how many days Mark has to save his money."
