You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden.

This involves dividing the total number of each color tulip by the number of tulips per row for that color.\n\n### Key Idea:\nCase 1: The problem can be solved directly with Python code.\n\n1. **Calculate rows for red tulips**: Divide the total number of red tulips (36) by the number of red tulips per row (6).\n2. **Calculate rows for blue tulips**: Divide the total number of blue tulips (24) by the number of blue tulips per row (8).\n3. **Sum the rows**: Sum the number of rows for the red and blue tulips.\n\nBelow is a Python program to perform the necessary calculations:\n\n```python\n# Parameters for the tulips\nred_tulips = 36\nred_tulips_per_row = 6\n\nblue_tulips = 24\nblue_tulips_per_row = 8\n\n# Calculate number of rows for each color\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_tulips_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_tulips_per_row\n\n# Total rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nLet's run the code to find out the number of rows Jackson will end up planting."
