You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRaymond initially had $2100.

We will start with the amount he initially had, add the amount he saved, and subtract the amounts he spent.\n\nHere's how we can do it step by step:\n\n1. Begin with the initial amount of money.\n2. Add the money he saved.\n3. Subtract the amounts he spent.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial amount of money\ninitial_money = 2100\n\n# Money saved\nmoney_saved = 1100\n\n# Money spent\nmoney_spent_on_comic = 500\nmoney_spent_on_puzzle = 1900\n\n# Calculate the amount of money left\nmoney_left = initial_money + money_saved - (money_spent_on_comic + money_spent_on_puzzle)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nNow, let's compute this to find out how much money Raymond has left."
