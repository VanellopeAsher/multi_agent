Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we will follow Case 1, since the problem can be solved directly with Python code. We need to calculate Jessica's annual payments for her debts by first determining her monthly payments, considering she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum required for each debt.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the increased payment for each type of debt:\n   - Student loans: the minimum monthly payment is $300, so Jessica will pay 1.5 times that amount.\n   - Credit card: the minimum monthly payment is $200, so Jessica will pay 1.5 times that amount.\n   - Mortgage: the minimum monthly payment is $500, so Jessica will pay 1.5 times that amount.\n\n2. Determine Jessica's total monthly payment for her debts by summing up the increased payments.\n\n3. Calculate the annual debt payment by multiplying the monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year).\n\nLet's now use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Minimum monthly payments for debts\nstudent_loan_payment = 300\ncredit_card_payment = 200\nmortgage_payment = 500\n\n# Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum\nincrease_factor = Rational(3, 2)  # 1.5 in fractions\n\n# Calculate increased payments\nincreased_student_loan_payment = increase_factor * student_loan_payment\nincreased_credit_card_payment = increase_factor * credit_card_payment\nincreased_mortgage_payment = increase_factor * mortgage_payment\n\n# Total monthly payment for debts\ntotal_monthly_payment = increased_student_loan_payment + increased_credit_card_payment + increased_mortgage_payment\n\n# Annual payment for her debts\nannual_debt_payment = 12 * total_monthly_payment\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Annual debt payment:\", annual_debt_payment)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the annual amount Jessica pays on her debts, based on her increased payments plan."
