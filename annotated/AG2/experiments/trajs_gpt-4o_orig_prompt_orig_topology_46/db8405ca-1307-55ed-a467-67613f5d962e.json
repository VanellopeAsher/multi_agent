You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn is a carpenter.

We can solve this directly with Python code by multiplying the number of items by their individual costs and then computing the total.\n\nKey idea:\n- Multiply the number of wooden tables by their cost to find the total cost for tables.\n- Multiply the number of roof frames by their cost to find the total cost for roof frames.\n- Add both totals to find the overall amount Ali has to pay John.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number and cost of wooden tables\nnum_tables = 40\ncost_per_table = 200\n\n# Number and cost of roof frames\nnum_roof_frames = 20\ncost_per_roof_frame = 100\n\n# Calculate total costs\ntotal_cost_tables = num_tables * cost_per_table\ntotal_cost_roof_frames = num_roof_frames * cost_per_roof_frame\n\n# Calculate overall total cost\ntotal_payment = total_cost_tables + total_cost_roof_frames\n\n# Print the results\nprint(total_payment)\n```\n\nLet's calculate this now."
