  "problem": "There are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

According to the problem, the second aircraft flies 44 flights, which represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n   \\]\n3. Solve for \\( x \\) to find the total number of flights made by the first aircraft.\n4. According to the problem, three-fourths of the first aircraft's flights are to Greece, and the rest are evenly divided between France and Germany.\n5. Compute the number of flights to France.\n\nLet's solve this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Eq, solve, symbols\n\n# Step 1: Define the variable for the total number of daily flights by the first aircraft\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Step 2: Equation representing that half of the first aircraft's flights equals 44\nequation = Eq(x / 2, 44)\n\n# Step 3: Solve the equation to find x\ntotal_flights_first_aircraft = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of flights made to France by the first aircraft\nflights_to_france = (1/4) * (total_flights_first_aircraft / 2)\n\n# Output\nprint(f\"Total number of flights to France: {flights_to_france}\")\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of daily flights the first aircraft makes to France."
