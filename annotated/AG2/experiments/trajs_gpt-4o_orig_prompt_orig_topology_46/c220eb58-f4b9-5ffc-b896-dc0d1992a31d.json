You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom.

James delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson.\n2. He delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.\n3. Calculate the total number of messages by summing the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.\n\nLet's write a Python program to compute this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of messages James delivers to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_to_thompson = 84\n\n# Calculate the messages he delivers to Mr. Yu\nmessages_to_yu = messages_to_thompson * Rational(1, 3)\n\n# Total messages delivered\ntotal_messages = messages_to_thompson + messages_to_yu\n\n# Output the total number of messages in fraction form\nprint(total_messages)\n```\n\nRunning this program will give the total number in fractional form. After calculating, we will get the answer in a boxed format."
