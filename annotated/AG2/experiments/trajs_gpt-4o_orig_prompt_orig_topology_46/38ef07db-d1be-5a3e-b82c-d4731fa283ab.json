You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We are given the lengths of both sides, so we can find the perimeter, which will be the total length of crepe-paper streamers James will need. This can be done directly with Python.\n\nKey idea: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula \\( \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this.\n\n```python\n# Importing relevant libraries\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Dimensions of the fence\nlength = Rational(20.5)  # Converting to a rational form for the exactness\nwidth = Rational(15.5)   # Converting to a rational form for the exactness\n\n# Calculating the perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result in fractional form\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nThis will give the total length of crepe-paper streamers needed in fractional form."
