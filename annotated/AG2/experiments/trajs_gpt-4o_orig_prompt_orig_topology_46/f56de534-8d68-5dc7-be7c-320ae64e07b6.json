You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We'll need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and then sum them up:\n\n1. A lego boxed set with 500 pieces.\n2. Another set with 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set.\n3. Another set with \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) the number of pieces than the 500-piece set.\n4.
