You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku compared to a normal sudoku.\n\nKey Idea: We can solve this problem directly by calculating the total time it takes for John to complete an extreme sudoku, then using that time to determine how many bottles of water he will drink.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the time John takes to complete an extreme sudoku in minutes.\n2. Determine how many bottles of water John drinks based on that time.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. A normal sudoku takes John 30 minutes.\n2. An extreme sudoku takes him 3 times that long, so it takes \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) minutes.\n3. John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes.\n\nNow let's calculate the number of bottles of water he drinks:\n\n```python\n# John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes\ntime_for_extreme_sudoku = 90  # in minutes\nbottles_of_water = time_for_extreme_sudoku // 30\n\nprint(bottles_of_water)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code."
