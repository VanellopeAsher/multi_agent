You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We'll clarify what we do know and what assumptions might solve the problem based on the given information.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Paisley ran 4 miles.\n- Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.\n\nLet's calculate how many miles Reggie ran:\n\n1. Calculate the distance Reggie ran.\n2. Assess if additional information or any typical assumption is provided about Lynn's distance (or if it typically follows a metric like half or equal the others), which is necessary to solve the problem.\n\nPerform the calculation for Reggie's distance:\n\nReggie ran \\(5 \\times 4\\) miles.\n\n```python\n# Reggie's distance\nreggie_distance = 5 * 4\nprint(reggie_distance)\n```\n\nGiven the problem as stated, this calculation will find the distance Reggie ran.

If the problem intended for us to use additional assumptions or typical patterns (such as running together for the same distance or a specific relationship like \"half the others combined\"), such an assumption is not given here.

This is purely speculative without explicit instructions, but let's pursue this hypothesized scenario:\n\n1. Paisley ran 4 miles.\n2. Reggie ran 20 miles. \n\nAssume they all ran together for the same distance, which is 4 miles for Paisley (if \"together\" implies the same distance, then the lowest value is considered their total running distance due to running together constraints).\n\n3. Thus, Lynn ran the same distance as Paisley, 4 miles.\n\nSo under this assumption, Lynn would have also run 4 miles:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\nDo note that this conclusion hinges on the assumption that \"running together\" indeed meant each running the same individual mileage as Paisley, which isn't directly supported by the original statement without such assumptions. If the problem implies something different, we would need additional clarification."
