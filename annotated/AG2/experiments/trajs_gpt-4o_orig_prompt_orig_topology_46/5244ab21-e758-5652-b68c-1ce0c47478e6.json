Calculate the total number of oranges from a dozen boxes.\n2. Subtract the number of oranges gifted to her mother and sibling.\n3. Determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself.\n4. The remaining oranges will be the ones she sold.\n\nThe key idea here is just a simple sequence of arithmetic calculations that we can easily perform programmatically.\n\nLet's go through the problem with the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary tools\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of oranges\ntotal_boxes = 12\noranges_per_box = 20\ntotal_oranges = total_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Oranges gifted to her mother and sibling\ngifted_boxes = 2 + 2\ngifted_oranges = gifted_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Remaining oranges after gifting\nremaining_oranges_after_gifting = total_oranges - gifted_oranges\n\n# Oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself\nkept_oranges = Rational(1, 4) * remaining_oranges_after_gifting\n\n# Oranges sold\nsold_oranges = remaining_oranges_after_gifting - kept_oranges\n\n# Print answer in fraction form\nprint(sold_oranges)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold and outputs it using a fractional form.

Thus, the number of gifted oranges is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\n3. After gifting, the remaining oranges are:\n   \\[\n   240 - 80 = 160\n   \\]\n\n4. Mrs. Harrington retained a quarter of the remaining oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 = 40\n   \\]\n\n5.

Mrs. Harrington initially has 12 boxes of oranges with each box containing 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 20 = 240\n   \\]\n\n2.

The remaining oranges after gifting are:\n   \\[\n   240 - 80 = 160\n   \\]\n\n4. Mrs. Harrington keeps for herself a quarter of these remaining oranges:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 = 40\n   \\]\n   oranges.\n\n5. Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is the original remaining oranges minus the ones she kept:\n   \\[\n   160 - 40 = 120\n   \\]\n\nHence, Mrs. Harrington sold \\(\\boxed{120}\\) oranges.\n\nLet's verify the approach using updated Python code:\n\n```python\n# Total number of oranges\ntotal_boxes = 12\noranges_per_box = 20\ntotal_oranges = total_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Oranges gifted to her mother and sibling\ngifted_boxes = 2 + 2\ngifted_oranges = gifted_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Remaining oranges after gifting\nremaining_oranges_after_gifting = total_oranges - gifted_oranges\n\n# Oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself\nkept_oranges = remaining_oranges_after_gifting / 4 \n\n# Oranges sold\nsold_oranges = remaining_oranges_after_gifting - kept_oranges\n\n# Print answer\nprint(sold_oranges)\n```\n\nThe number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is correctly \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
