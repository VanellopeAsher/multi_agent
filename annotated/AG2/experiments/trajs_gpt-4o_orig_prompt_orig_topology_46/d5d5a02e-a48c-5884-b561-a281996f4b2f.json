You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "Thank you for the calculation. Let's use the algebraic solution to understand it better with exact values and not decimals. We can directly reason to ensure the results make sense.\nGiven:\n1. Emil's current age is 21.\n2. When Emil is 26, he will be twice the age of his brother and half the age of his dad.\n\nFrom this information, we had the equations:\n- \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (d + 5) \\)\n- \\( 26 = 2 \\times (b + 5) \\)\n\nSolving these gives:\n- \\( d + 5 = 2 \\times 26 \\)\n- \\( b + 5 = \\frac{26}{2} \\)\n\nLet's validate these steps with calculations:\n\n1. Since Emil will be half the age of his dad when Emil is 26:\n   \\[\n   d + 5 = 2 \\times 26 \\implies d + 5 = 52 \\implies d = 47\n   \\]\n\n2. Since Emil will be twice the age of his brother when Emil is 26:\n   \\[\n   26 = 2 \\times (b + 5) \\implies b + 5 = 13 \\implies b = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, Emil's dad is currently 47, and his brother is currently 8. The sum of their current ages is:\n\\[ \nd + b = 47 + 8 = 55\n\\]\n\nOverall, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{55}\n\\]"
