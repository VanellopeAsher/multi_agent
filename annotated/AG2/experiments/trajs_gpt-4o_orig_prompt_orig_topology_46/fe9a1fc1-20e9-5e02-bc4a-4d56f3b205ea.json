You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Define the relationship between the number of cookies each person has based on the problem statement.\n2. Use sympy to solve for the number of cookies each person has and calculate the total.\n\n### Steps:\n- Let \\( C \\) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.\n- Max has \\( 1.2 \\times (C + 10) \\) cookies.\n- Katarina has Max's cookies minus 5, which is given as 6.8 times 10.\n- Equate Katarina's number of cookies to solve for \\( C \\).\n- Summer has Max's cookies plus 23.\n- Calculate the total number of cookies they all have.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the unknown variable\nC = symbols('C')\n\n# Equations based on problem statement\nmax_cookies = 1.2 * (C + 10)\nkatarina_cookies = max_cookies - 5\nkatarina_equals_given = Eq(katarina_cookies, 6.8 * 10)\n\n# Solve for the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has\ncookie_monster_cookies = solve(katarina_equals_given, C)[0]\n\n# Calculate cookies for each person\nmax_cookies = 1.2 * (cookie_monster_cookies + 10)\nkatarina_cookies = max_cookies - 5\nsummer_cookies = max_cookies + 23\n\n# Total cookies\ntotal_cookies = cookie_monster_cookies + max_cookies + katarina_cookies + summer_cookies\n\n# Print the result in fractional form\nprint(total_cookies)\n```\n\nThis code will yield the total number of cookies they have together.
