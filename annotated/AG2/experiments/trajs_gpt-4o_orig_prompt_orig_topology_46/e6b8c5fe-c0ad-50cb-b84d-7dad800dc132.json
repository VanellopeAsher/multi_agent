You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nColby wants to buy some gumballs.

We'll assume each gumball costs 25 cents (or 1 quarter).\n\n**Key Idea**: Use Python to calculate the total amount of money in cents and then divide by the cost of a gumball.\n\nWe'll follow Case 1, since the problem can be solved directly with Python code.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the value of each type of coin in cents\nquarter_value = 25\ndime_value = 10\nnickel_value = 5\npenny_value = 1\n\n# The number of each type of coin\nnum_quarters = 8\nnum_dimes = 6\nnum_nickels = 14\nnum_pennies = 15\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money in cents\ntotal_cents = (num_quarters * quarter_value) + (num_dimes * dime_value) + \\\n              (num_nickels * nickel_value) + (num_pennies * penny_value)\n\n# Assuming each gumball costs 25 cents\ngumball_cost = 25\n\n# Calculate the maximum number of gumballs that can be bought\nnum_gumballs = total_cents // gumball_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(num_gumballs)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and print the number of gumballs Colby can buy. Let's execute the code to find the answer."
