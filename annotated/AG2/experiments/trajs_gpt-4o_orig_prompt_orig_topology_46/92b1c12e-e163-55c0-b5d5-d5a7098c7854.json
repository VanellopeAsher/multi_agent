You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.

This fits Case 1, where we can solve it directly with code.\n\n**Key Idea**: Use algebraic equations to express the relationships and solve for the son's age.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( C \\) as Carver's age.\n- \\( D \\) as his daughter's age.\n- \\( S \\) as his son's age.\n\nThe problem gives us the following information:\n1. Carver is 45 years old.\n2. Carver is 5 years younger than twice his daughter's age: \\( C = 2D - 5 \\).\n3. His daughter is 4 years older than three times his son's age: \\( D = 3S + 4 \\).\n\nSubstituting these into equations gives:\n\\[\nC = 45\n\\]\n\\[\n45 = 2D - 5\n\\]\n\\[\nD = 3S + 4\n\\]\n\nUsing these equations, we will solve for \\( S \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nC, D, S = symbols('C D S', integer=True)\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(C, 45)\neq2 = Eq(C, 2*D - 5)\neq3 = Eq(D, 3*S + 4)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (C, D, S))\n\n# Output the solution for the son's age S\nprint(solution[S])\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the age of Carver's son."
