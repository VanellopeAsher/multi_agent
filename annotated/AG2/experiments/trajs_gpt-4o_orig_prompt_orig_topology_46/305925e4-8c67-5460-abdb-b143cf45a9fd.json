You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Determine Joey's final score after his turn.\n2. Calculate Marcy's final score after scoring 10 points.\n3. Find the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score.\n\nSince the problem statement misses the specific points Joey scores after his turn, we'll assume you wanted to know what would happen next if more information was given, or that some points should be filled in. For now, let's assume Joey scores \\( x \\) points.\n\nWe express this in terms of Python coding by using a symbolic computation approach since the specific points are unknown.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Let x be the points Joey scores\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Joey's initial score\njoey_initial_score = 214\n\n# Marcy's initial score\nmarcy_initial_score = 225\n\n# Joey's final score after his turn\njoey_final_score = joey_initial_score + x\n\n# Marcy's final score after scoring 10 points\nmarcy_final_score = marcy_initial_score + 10\n\n# Calculate the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score\ndifference = joey_final_score - marcy_final_score\n\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nPlease adjust the value used for \\( x \\) when you know the specific number of points Joey scored.
