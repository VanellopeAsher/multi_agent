You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Let \\( x \\) be the amount of money Walter's friend donates.\n3. According to the problem, Walter's lawyer donates three times what everyone else donated combined. This includes the neighbors, the online fund, and his friend.\n4. Set up an equation for the lawyer's donation, which is given as $6600, and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's go through the solution in Python using these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Total collected from neighbors and online fund\nneighbors = 500\nonline_fund = 1500\ntotal_collected = neighbors + online_fund\n\n# Define the friend's donation as a symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Lawyer's donation equation\nlawyer_donation = 3 * (total_collected + x)\n\n# Equation representing the problem\nequation = Eq(lawyer_donation, 6600)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nfriend_donation = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\nprint(friend_donation)\n```\n\nUsing the above code, we can calculate how much Walter's friend donated.
