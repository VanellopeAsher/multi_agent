You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll first identify how the total paint is distributed among the four different colors, given the conditions specified. This is a straightforward algebra problem (Case 1), which we can solve easily.\n\nKey idea:\n- Half of the mural is painted yellow, so 6 pints of paint are yellow (since half of 12 pints is 6 pints).\n- The remaining paint, which consists of red, white, and purple, will sum up to the other half of the mural, which is 6 pints.\n- Since the red, white, and purple colors are used in equal amounts, the quantity of paint for each of these colors can be found by dividing the remaining 6 pints equally among the three colors.\n\nLet's calculate the amount of red paint:\n\n```python\n# Total pints of paint used in the mural\ntotal_pints = 12\n\n# Half the mural is yellow\nyellow_pints = total_pints / 2\n\n# The remaining pints are equally shared among red, white, and purple\nremaining_pints = total_pints - yellow_pints\nred_pints = white_pints = purple_pints = remaining_pints / 3\n\nprint(red_pints)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we should get the amount of red paint used in the mural. Let's proceed with the calculation."
