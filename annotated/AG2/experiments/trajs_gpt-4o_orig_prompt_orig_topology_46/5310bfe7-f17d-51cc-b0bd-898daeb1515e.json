You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

We know the scores are related in the following ways:\n\n- Richie scored 90 goals.\n- Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n- Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\nUsing these relationships, we can find the scores for Mark and Anna. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Let \\( R \\), \\( M \\), and \\( A \\) represent the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna, respectively.\n\n2. From the problem, we have:\n   \\[\n   R = 90\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   R = M + 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   R = A + 55\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( M \\) and \\( A \\):\n   \\[\n   M = R - 30 = 90 - 30 = 60\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = R - 55 = 90 - 55 = 35\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the total number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna by adding their individual goals.\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Values for Richie's, Mark's, and Anna's goals\nR = 90\nM = R - 30\nA = R - 55\n\n# Total goals\ntotal_goals = R + M + A\n\n# Output the total number of goals in terms of fractions/radical forms if needed\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(Rational(total_goals))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers."
