Calculate the cost of the shoes with the 40% discount.\n3. Sum the total costs from steps 1 and 2.\n\nLet's go through the steps in detail.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the T-shirts.**\n\nJake buys 20 T-shirts, and there is a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $80.\n\nGiven the deal, for every 2 T-shirts:\n\n- The first T-shirt is full price: $80.\n- The second T-shirt is half price: $40.\n- Therefore, the total cost for a pair in the deal is $80 + $40 = $120.\n\nSince Jake buys 20 T-shirts, he will use the buy one get one 50% off deal 10 times (20 divided by 2).\n\nTotal cost for 20 T-shirts = 10 * $120.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes with the discount.**\n\nThe original price of the shoes is $400, and they are 40% off.\n\nDiscount on shoes = 40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400.\n\nDiscounted price of shoes = $400 - (0.4 * $400).\n\n**Step 3: Sum the total costs.**\n\nAdd the total cost of T-shirts and the cost of shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends.\n\nI'll write a Python program to calculate the final amount.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices and quantities\ntshirt_price = 80\ntshirt_pairs = 10  # since Jake buys 20 t-shirts and the deal is for pairs (2 per deal)\nshoes_original_price = 400\nshoes_discount = Rational(40, 100)  # 40% as a fraction\n\n# Calculate total price for t-shirts\ntshirt_total_cost = tshirt_pairs * ((1 * tshirt_price) + (0.5 * tshirt_price))\n\n# Calculate total price for shoes\nshoes_discounted_price = shoes_original_price * (1 - shoes_discount)\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = tshirt_total_cost + shoes_discounted_price\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nOnce we run this code, we will get the total amount of money Jake spends, expressed in dollars.\n\nLet's calculate that value."
