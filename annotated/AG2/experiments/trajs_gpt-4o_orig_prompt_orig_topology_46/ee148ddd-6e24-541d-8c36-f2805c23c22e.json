  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Calculate the total time John spent on activities, excluding breaks and lunch.\n2. Use the information about the percentage of time spent on watching shows to determine the total activity time.\n3. Calculate the time spent sightseeing based on the percentage provided.\n\nGiven Variables:\n- Boating: 6 hours\n- Swimming: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of boating time = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3 \\) hours\n- Watching shows: 3 shows, 2 hours each = \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n- Watching shows is 30% of activity time.\n- Sightseeing is 40% of activity time.\n\nLet's execute this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Eq, solve, symbols\n\n# Define the variable for total activity time\ntotal_time = symbols('total_time')\n\n# Time used for watching shows, which is 30% of the total activity time\nwatching_shows = 6  # 3 shows of 2 hours each\n\n# Set up the equation: watching_shows is 30% of total_time\nequation = Eq(watching_shows, 0.3 * total_time)\n\n# Solve the equation to find total_time\ntotal_activity_time = solve(equation)[0]\n\n# Time spent on sightseeing is 40% of the total activity time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_activity_time\n\n# Print the time spent sightseeing in fractional form\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nRunning the code, we'll find the total time John spent on activities and then determine how much of that was spent sightseeing.

Let \\( x \\) be the total activity time.\n2. Since watching shows is 30% of the total activity time:\n   \\[\n   0.3x = 6\n   \\]\n3. Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{0.3} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n4.
