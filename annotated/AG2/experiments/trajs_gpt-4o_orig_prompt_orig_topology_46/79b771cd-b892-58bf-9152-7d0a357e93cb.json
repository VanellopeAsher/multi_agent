  "problem": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand outside the dragon's attack range while still being able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWhen Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than usual. We will use this fact to find out how far outside the dragon's range she can stand.\n\n1. **Determine the enhanced throwing distance**: Normally, Polly can throw the javelin 4000 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it 3 times as far.\n2. **Calculate the range**: The distance she can throw with the gemstone minus the dragon's attack range gives the distance she can safely stand outside the attack range.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Python code to solve the problem\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the normal and enhanced ranges\nnormal_range = 4000  # Polly's normal throw distance in feet\ngemstone_multiplier = 3\nenhanced_range = normal_range * gemstone_multiplier\n\n# Calculate the safe distance outside of the dragon's flame range\ndragon_range = 10000  # Dragon's attack range in feet\nsafe_distance = enhanced_range - dragon_range\n\n# Print the result in terms of distance\nprint(safe_distance)\n```\n\nRun this Python code, and it will calculate the distance Polly can safely stand outside the dragon's range and still hit it with the javelin while holding the gemstone."
