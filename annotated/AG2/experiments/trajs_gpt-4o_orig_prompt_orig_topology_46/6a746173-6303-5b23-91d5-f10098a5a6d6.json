      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from the neighbors and the online fund, then determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute based on that total. \n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer contributes.** \n   - Walter collects $300 from his neighbors.\n   - Walter collects $1200 from the online fund.\n   - In total, this amount is \\(300 + 1200\\).\n\n2. **Determine the lawyer's contribution.**\n   - The lawyer offers to donate three times the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer's contribution.\n   - Additionally, Walter's friend gives him $120, but this amount doesn't affect the lawyer's primary offer.\n\n3. **Calculate the lawyer's total contribution using the formula:**\n   - Lawyer's contribution = 3 times Walter's total collection (excluding the lawyer).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the amounts collected\nneighbors = 300\nonline_fund = 1200\nfriend_contribution = 120\n\n# Calculate the total collected by Walter before the lawyer contributes\ntotal_before_lawyer = neighbors + online_fund + friend_contribution\n\n# Calculate the lawyer's contribution\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * (neighbors + online_fund)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lawyer_contribution)\n```\n\nNow, let's evaluate the result based on the setup:\n\n- Total collected from neighbors and online fund = $1500\n- Lawyer's contribution = \\(3 \\times 1500 = 4500\\)\n\nThus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \\(\\boxed{4500}\\) dollars."
