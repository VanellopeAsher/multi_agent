  "problem": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of all the packs of gum Suzie bought. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the strawberry gum: Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, and each pack costs $2.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the grape gum: Suzie bought one pack, which costs $2.\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the green apple gum: Suzie bought one small pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum. Since the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs $2 / 2.\n\n4. Add up all the costs to find the total amount Suzie paid.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate the total in fractions/radical forms.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs of each type of gum pack\nstrawberry_cost_per_pack = 2\ngrape_cost = 2\ngreen_apple_cost = Rational(grape_cost, 2)  # half the cost of grape gum\n\n# Number of packs bought\nstrawberry_packs = 2\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = (strawberry_packs * strawberry_cost_per_pack) + grape_cost + green_apple_cost\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total amount Suzie paid in a fraction form. Let's evaluate it to get the final result."
