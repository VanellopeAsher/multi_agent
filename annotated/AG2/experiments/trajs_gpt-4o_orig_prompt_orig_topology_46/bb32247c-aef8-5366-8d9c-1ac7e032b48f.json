You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

Let \\( h \\) be the height of the beanstalk after the first week.\n2. In the second week, the beanstalk doubles its height. So, its height becomes \\( 2h \\).\n3. In the third week, it grows another 4 inches, making the total height \\( 2h + 4 \\) inches.\n\nWe can write a Python program to express this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable h, representing the height after the first week\nh = symbols('h')\n\n# The height after 3 weeks\nheight_after_3_weeks = 2 * h + 4\n\nprint(height_after_3_weeks)\n```\n\nThis program symbolically represents the height of the beanstalk in terms of \\( h \\), which is its height after the first week. Since the problem doesn't specify \\( h \\), there is no numerical answer. However, the expression \\( 2h + 4 \\) gives us the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks in terms of \\( h \\)."

If you have additional information about the initial height, we can substitute that into the expression to obtain a numerical result. \n\nThe expression \\(\\boxed{2h + 4}\\) represents the final height in inches after 3 weeks based on the conditions given."
