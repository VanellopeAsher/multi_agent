You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

We can approach this by calculating the total cost of the other items and then using the remaining amount to find out how many boxes of pizza she bought.\n\nWe'll follow Case 1 since this problem involves direct calculations that can be done with Python code:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples.\n2. Subtract this total from the overall amount paid by Marie to determine the total cost of the pizza boxes.\n3. Divide the remaining amount by the cost of one pizza box to find out how many boxes were ordered.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Total paid\ntotal_paid = 52.5\n\n# Costs\nchicken_meal_cost = 12\nmilk_pack_cost = 3.5\napple_cost = 1.5\npizza_box_cost = 8.5\n\n# Quantities\nnum_milk_packs = 5\nnum_apples = 4\n\n# Calculate total cost of chicken, milk, and apples\ntotal_other_items_cost = (chicken_meal_cost + num_milk_packs * milk_pack_cost + num_apples * apple_cost)\n\n# Remaining cost after buying other items\nremaining_cost_for_pizza = total_paid - total_other_items_cost\n\n# Define the number of pizza boxes as a symbol\nnum_pizza_boxes = symbols('num_pizza_boxes')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(num_pizza_boxes * pizza_box_cost, remaining_cost_for_pizza)\n\n# Solve the equation\nresult = solve(equation, num_pizza_boxes)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result[0])\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and output the number of pizza boxes ordered by Marie.
