You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.

The problem also gives the length of February as 2.8 times of ten days, which can be interpreted as 28 days.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe can solve this problem directly by calculating the number of articles published by each website and then summing them up for the entire duration of February.\n\nLet's go ahead and compute this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Import the fractions module to handle output in fractions if needed\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the daily article publishing rates\npolitical_weather_daily = 20  # Political and weather articles published per day\nbusiness_daily = 10  # Business articles published per day\n\n# Set the number of days in February\nfebruary_days = int(2.8 * 10)\n\n# Calculate the total articles in February for each website\ntotal_political_weather_articles = political_weather_daily * february_days\ntotal_business_articles = business_daily * february_days\n\n# Calculate the total number of articles published by both websites together\ntotal_articles = total_political_weather_articles + total_business_articles\n\n# Output the result using the print function\nprint(total_articles)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you will determine the total number of articles published by both websites together in February. The output will correspond to the number of articles published by the combined efforts of both websites over a 28-day period."
