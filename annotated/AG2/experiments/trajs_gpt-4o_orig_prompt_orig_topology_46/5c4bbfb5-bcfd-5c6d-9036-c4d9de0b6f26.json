  "problem": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

Calculate the total cost of apples based on the cost of strawberries.\n5. Add up all these costs to get the total expenditure.\n6. Subtract the total expenditure from Kelly's budget to find out how much she has left.\n\nWe will use Python with the SymPy library to handle fractions and ensure results are in proper form.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Cost of 5 packs of bacon\ntotal_bacon_cost = Rational(21, 2)  # $10.5\ncost_of_one_bacon = total_bacon_cost / 5\n\n# Cost of chicken - each costs twice as much as a pack of bacon\ncost_of_one_chicken = 2 * cost_of_one_bacon\ntotal_chicken_cost = 6 * cost_of_one_chicken\n\n# Cost of strawberries\ncost_of_one_strawberry_pack = Rational(9, 2)  # $4.5\ntotal_strawberry_cost = 3 * cost_of_one_strawberry_pack\n\n# Cost of apples - each costs half the price of a pack of strawberries\ncost_of_one_apple_pack = cost_of_one_strawberry_pack / 2\ntotal_apple_cost = 7 * cost_of_one_apple_pack\n\n# Total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = total_bacon_cost + total_chicken_cost + total_strawberry_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# Kelly's budget\nbudget = 65\n\n# Remaining budget\nremaining_budget = budget - total_expenditure\n\nprint(remaining_budget)\n```\n\nThis script will compute the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget after purchasing the items.
