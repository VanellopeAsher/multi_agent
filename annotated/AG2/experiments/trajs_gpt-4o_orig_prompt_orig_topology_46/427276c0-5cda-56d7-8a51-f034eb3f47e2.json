You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels.

We'll do this by finding the total height of all the heels and then dividing by the number of women wearing those heels.\n\nKey Idea:\nThis problem can be solved directly using arithmetic in Python. Let's write a Python program to calculate the average height of the heels.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Heights of the heels\nheel_height_1 = Rational(9, 2) # equivalent to 4.5 inches\nheel_height_2 = Rational(5, 2) # equivalent to 2.5 inches\n\n# Number of women wearing each type of heel\ncount_heel_1 = 3\ncount_heel_2 = 3\n\n# Total height of heels = (number of women) * (height of their heels)\ntotal_height = count_heel_1 * heel_height_1 + count_heel_2 * heel_height_2\n\n# Total number of women in heels\ntotal_count = count_heel_1 + count_heel_2\n\n# Calculate average height\naverage_height = total_height / total_count\n\n# Print the average height\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the average height of the heels worn at the party, ensuring the result is expressed as a fraction."
