You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

The number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday is the same, and Friday's production is twice that amount. Let's solve this using Python.\n\nKey Idea (Case 1): The problem can be easily solved through Python by setting up an equation.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n2. Then, Wednesday will also have \\( x \\) chimichangas.\n3. Friday will have \\( 2x \\) chimichangas.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx + x + 2x = 500\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Create the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(x + x + 2*x, 500)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the solution to how many chimichangas are made on Tuesday."
