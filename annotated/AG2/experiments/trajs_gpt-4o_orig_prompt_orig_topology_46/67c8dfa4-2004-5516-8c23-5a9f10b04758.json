Each pack contains 5 canvas bags and costs $4.\n2. Each painted canvas bag is sold for $8.\n3. Tara's profit from selling the bags amounts to $160.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Calculate the total revenue Tara made from selling the bags.\n- Calculate the cost for the number of packs she bought.\n- Use these variables to set up an equation based on the given profit.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of packs Tara bought.\n\nThe total number of bags is \\( 5x \\).\nThe total cost for buying the packs is \\( 4x \\) dollars.\nThe revenue from selling all bags is \\( 8 \\times 5x = 40x \\) dollars.\n\nThe profit is given by the difference between the revenue and the cost:\n\n\\[\n40x - 4x = 160\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python to find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(40*x - 4*x, 160)\n\n# Solve the equation\npacks_bought = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the answer\nprint(packs_bought)\n```\n\nThis should give us the number of packs Tara bought."
