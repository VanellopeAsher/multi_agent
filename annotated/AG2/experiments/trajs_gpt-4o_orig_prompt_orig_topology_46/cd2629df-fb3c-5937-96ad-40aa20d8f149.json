For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month. On the twelfth month, he will pay the remaining amount, including the interest, and also plans to buy a coin worth $100.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

Calculate the total payment over the first 11 months.\n2. Determine the total loan amount with interest.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step and calculate using Python.\n\nGiven Variables:\n- Initial loan: $300\n- Additional interest: 2%\n- Monthly payment for the first 11 months: $25\n- Total number of months: 12\n\nWe'll follow these steps in our calculation:\n1. Calculate the interest amount and the total amount to be repaid.\n2. Determine the total amount repaid in the first 11 months.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month.\n\nNow let's write the Python code for these steps.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial loan amount\nloan_amount = 300\n\n# Calculate the interest\ninterest = Rational(2, 100) * loan_amount\n\n# Total amount to be repaid after adding interest\ntotal_repay_amount = loan_amount + interest\n\n# Monthly payment for the first 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\nmonths_paid = 11\n\n# Total repaid in the first 11 months\namount_paid_first_11_months = monthly_payment * months_paid\n\n# Remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month\nremaining_amount = total_repay_amount - amount_paid_first_11_months\n\n# Output the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month."
