You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

We'll use Python to perform the calculations and show the results.\n\n### Key Idea:\nThe problem can be solved directly with simple arithmetic operations. We'll calculate each expense separately and sum them up to get the total yearly cost.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Calculate the cost of food per year by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year.\n2. Calculate the cost of treats per year.\n3. Calculate the cost of medicine per year.\n4. Calculate the cost of shampoo per year.\n5. Calculate the cost of toys per year.\n6. Sum all these costs to get the total yearly expenditure.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Constants\nweeks_per_month = 4\nmonths_per_year = 12\nweeks_per_year = weeks_per_month * months_per_year\n\n# Calculate yearly costs\nfood_cost_per_year = 25 * weeks_per_year\ntreats_cost_per_year = 20 * months_per_year\nmedicine_cost_per_year = 100 * months_per_year\nshampoo_cost_per_year = 15 * months_per_year\ntoys_cost_per_year = 10 * (months_per_year / 2)\n\n# Total yearly cost\ntotal_yearly_cost = (food_cost_per_year + treats_cost_per_year +\n                     medicine_cost_per_year + shampoo_cost_per_year +\n                     toys_cost_per_year)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year is ${total_yearly_cost}.\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year."
