You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll assume that the \"20% saved\" refers to the cost reduction compared to buying pre-made wallpaper due to making his own. However, we need additional information about the total savings or original cost to find the exact total cost Ethan incurred. Without this information, we cannot compute the exact total cost Ethan spent.\n\nAssuming we need additional information, here's how this problem can be broken down (Case 3):\n\n1. Let \\( C_\\text{diy} \\) be the cost of making the DIY wallpaper.\n2. Let \\( C_\\text{premade} \\) be the cost of buying pre-made wallpaper.\n3. We are told that \\( C_\\text{diy} \\) is 20% less than \\( C_\\text{premade} \\). Therefore, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   C_\\text{diy} = C_\\text{premade} \\times (1 - 0.20) = C_\\text{premade} \\times 0.80\n   \\]\n4. To solve for the exact cost, we need either \\( C_\\text{premade} \\) or the exact amount saved.\n\nIf you can provide information on the original cost of the pre-made wallpaper, we can calculate the cost of making the DIY wallpaper.\n\nPlease provide the additional information required to proceed with the calculations."

      "content": "Since we don't have all the information needed to find the exact cost directly, let's assume we have the original cost of the pre-made wallpaper. We'll denote this cost as \\( C_\\text{premade} \\).\n\nGiven:\n- The cost of making the DIY wallpaper is 20% less than the pre-made version.\n- Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  C_\\text{diy} = C_\\text{premade} \\times 0.80\n  \\]\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the specific value for \\( C_\\text{premade} \\), we can't compute \\( C_\\text{diy} \\) directly.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, let me set an arbitrary value for \\( C_\\text{premade} \\), solve the equation, and then you can replace it with the correct value based on your context.\n\nFor example, if the pre-made wallpaper costs \\$100 (you'll replace this with the correct value if you have it):\n\n1. Assume \\( C_\\text{premade} = 100 \\).\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\nC_\\text{diy} = C_\\text{premade} \\times 0.80 = 100 \\times 0.80 = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost for the DIY wallpaper would be \\( \\boxed{80} \\) when assuming a pre-made cost of \\$100.\n\nPlease replace the \\$100 with the actual pre-made cost, if known, to find the actual \\( C_\\text{diy} \\)."
