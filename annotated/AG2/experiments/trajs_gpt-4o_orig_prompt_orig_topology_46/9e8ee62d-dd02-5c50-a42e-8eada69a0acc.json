You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem (Case 1: The problem can be solved with Python code directly).\n\n1. After the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.\n2. It doubled in height the second week, so after the second week, it would be \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches tall.\n3. After the third week, the problem states the beanstalk is 10 inches tall.\n\nWe need to find out how much it grew in the third week, given it was 6 inches tall after the second week and 10 inches tall after the third week.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate the growth during the third week.\n\n```python\n# Initial height after the first week\nweek_1_height = 3\n\n# Height after the second week (it doubles)\nweek_2_height = week_1_height * 2\n\n# Final height after the third week\nweek_3_final_height = 10\n\n# Growth during the third week\ngrowth_week_3 = week_3_final_height - week_2_height\n\n# Display the result\nprint(growth_week_3)\n```\n\nLet's run the code to find out the growth in the third week."
