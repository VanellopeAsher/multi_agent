You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to find the forgotten score based on the information that the mean (average) score is 70. We can approach this by calculating the sum of all the scores including the forgotten one, then setting up an equation to solve for the missing score.\n\nHere's how we can solve it:\n\n1. Let's denote the forgotten score as \\( x \\).\n2. The mean of the scores is given by the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{mean} = \\frac{\\text{sum of all scores}}{\\text{number of scores}}\n   \\]\n\n   In this case, the mean is 70, and there are 9 quizzes in total (8 known scores and 1 forgotten score).\n\n3. Let's first calculate the sum of the known scores:\n\n   - Known scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70\n\n4. We set up the equation for the mean:\n\n   \\[\n   70 = \\frac{50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + x}{9}\n   \\]\n\n5. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Known scores\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# Calculate the sum of known scores\nknown_sum = sum(scores)\n\n# Define the forgotten score as a symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation for the mean\nmean_equation = Eq((known_sum + x) / 9, 70)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nforgotten_score = solve(mean_equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the forgotten score\nprint(forgotten_score)\n```\n\nRunning this code gives us the forgotten score. \n\nLet's compute it:\n\nThe sum of the known scores is:\n\\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570 \\]\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[ 70 = \\frac{570 + x}{9} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 9:\n\\[ 630 = 570 + x \\]\n\nSubtract 570 from both sides:\n\\[ x = 60 \\]\n\nSo, the forgotten score is \\(\\boxed{60}\\)."
