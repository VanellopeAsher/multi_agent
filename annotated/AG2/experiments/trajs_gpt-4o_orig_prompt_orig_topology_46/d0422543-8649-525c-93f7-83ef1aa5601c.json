You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to express the relationship between Carver's age and his son's age as an equation. This is a straightforward problem (Case 1), which can be solved by setting up and solving a simple algebraic equation.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( x \\) as the son's current age in years.\n\nAccording to the problem, Carver's age is 8 years less than twice the son's age. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x - 8 = 60 \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for son's age\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(2*x - 8, 60)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsons_age = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(sons_age[0])\n```\n\nThis code will output the son's age, keeping the integral form as expected. Run this code to find the result."
