  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Oats: He buys twenty 65-pound sacks, for a total weight of \\(20 \\times 65 = 1300\\) pounds.\n\nNext, we calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the number of trips (2) to find the carrying capacity needed for each trip.\n\nLet's put this into Python code:\n\n```python\n# Importing the library to help with formatting\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculating total weight\nsugar_cubes_weight = 2 # 2 boxes, each 1 pound\ncarrots_weight = 4 * 12 # 4 bags, each 12 pounds\nhay_weight = 42 * 75 # 42 bales, each 75 pounds\noats_weight = 20 * 65 # 20 sacks, each 65 pounds\n\ntotal_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight\n\n# Calculating weight per trip\ntrips = 2\nweight_per_trip = Rational(total_weight, trips)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weight_per_trip)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the answer to how many pounds the truck can carry per trip:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2250}\n\\]"
