You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

Calculate the number of hours Tim works on Friday, considering the extra 2 hours.\n4. Calculate the number of calls Tim handles on Friday.\n5. Sum the total number of calls Tim handles over the 5-day work week.\n\nThis problem can be directly solved using Python, so I'll write a program for it.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to handle fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the time Tim spends working each day (in hours)\nhours_per_day = 6\n\n# Define the time Tim spends working on Friday (in hours)\nhours_on_friday = hours_per_day + 2\n\n# Define the time taken to handle each call (in hours, using Rational for fraction handling)\ntime_per_call = Rational(15, 60)  # 15 minutes is 15/60 hours\n\n# Calculate the calls handled from Monday to Thursday (4 days)\ncalls_per_day = hours_per_day / time_per_call\ntotal_calls_mon_thu = calls_per_day * 4\n\n# Calculate the calls handled on Friday\ncalls_on_friday = hours_on_friday / time_per_call\n\n# Calculate the total number of calls in the week\ntotal_calls_week = total_calls_mon_thu + calls_on_friday\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_calls_week)\n```\n\nExecuting this program will give the total number of calls Tim handles during his 5-day work week."
