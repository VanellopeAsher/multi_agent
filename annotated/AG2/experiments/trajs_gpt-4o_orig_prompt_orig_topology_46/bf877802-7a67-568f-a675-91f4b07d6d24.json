You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and determine what we need to calculate.\n\n### Key Idea\n\nThe problem involves calculating the angle between the ground and the sun after a certain movement pattern. We need to consider the following facts:\n\n1. Initially, there is a 32-degree angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid.\n2. The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour for 10 hours starting from the tip of the pyramid.\n3. Next, the sun moves at 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours.\n\nWe need to calculate the final angle from the ground to the sun.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. Calculate the angle after the first movement phase (5 degrees/hour for 10 hours).\n2. Calculate the angle after the second movement phase (3 degrees/hour for 2 hours).\n3. Add these movements to the initial angle of 32 degrees.\n\nLet's use Python to do this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Initial angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid\ninitial_angle = 32\n\n# Calculate angle after first phase of movement (5 degrees/hour for 10 hours)\nfirst_movement = 5 * 10\n\n# Calculate angle after second phase of movement (3 degrees/hour for 2 hours)\nsecond_movement = 3 * 2\n\n# Total angle from the ground to the sun\nfinal_angle = initial_angle + first_movement + second_movement\n\n# Print the result\nprint(final_angle)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the final angle from the ground to the sun after the described movements. Let's run it and see the result."
