She then purchased two packets of stones from a pet shop, each costing $2.50, and three coral pieces priced at $2.00 each.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a garage sale, Scarlett discovered a fish tank priced at $10.00.

Calculate the total cost of the stone packets.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the coral pieces.\n4. Calculate the total cost of the fish.\n5. Add the cost of the fish food.\n\nFinally, sum up all these costs to get the total amount spent. Given that this problem can be directly solved by a simple calculation, we'll use Python to determine this amount:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs of individual items\ncost_fish_tank = 10.00\ncost_stone_packet = 2.50\ncost_coral_piece = 2.00\ncost_fish = 0.50\ncost_fish_food = 2.00\n\n# Quantities of each item\nnum_stone_packets = 2\nnum_coral_pieces = 3\nnum_fish = 20\n\n# Total costs\ntotal_stones = num_stone_packets * cost_stone_packet\ntotal_corals = num_coral_pieces * cost_coral_piece\ntotal_fish = num_fish * cost_fish\ntotal_food = cost_fish_food\n\n# Total amount spent\ntotal_amount_spent = (cost_fish_tank + total_stones + total_corals + total_fish + total_food)\n\n# Use Rational to keep fractions precise\ntotal_amount_spent_fraction = Rational(total_amount_spent)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_amount_spent_fraction)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the total amount using this code to get the result in fractional form."
