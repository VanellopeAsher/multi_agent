Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Calculate the total cost Manny's parents are willing to accept: $20 per class.\n2. Calculate the total number of classes he must attend to ensure the per-class cost remains $20 or less.\n3. Subtract the number of classes he must attend from the total number of classes to determine how many he can miss.\n\n### Key idea:\n- If the total payment is $80 and the cost per class must not exceed $20, Manny can miss some of the 12 classes, but the classes he attends cannot cost more than $20 each.\n\n### Calculation:\n1. Set up the inequality for the number of classes he must attend (let's denote the number of classes he attends as \\(x\\)):  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20\n   \\]\n2. Solve this inequality for \\(x\\).\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the number of classes he attends\nx = symbols('x', positive=True, integer=True)\n\n# Set up the inequality\ninequality = 80 / x <= 20\n\n# Solve the inequality for x\nx_values = solve(inequality, x)\n\n# Calculate the maximum number of classes he can miss\ntotal_classes = 12\nclasses_to_attend = max(x_values)\nclasses_he_can_miss = total_classes - classes_to_attend\n\nprint(classes_he_can_miss)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the inequality to determine the minimum number of classes Manny must attend and then calculate how many classes he can miss."
