You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

The initial amount of water on the first day: 4000 gallons.\n2. After heavy rain, the amount doubles on the second day: 2 * 4000 gallons.\n3. On the third day, the total amount of water is 14000 gallons.\n\nGiven this information, our task is to calculate the increase in the water volume from the second day to the third day.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Calculate the amount of water on the second day.\n2. Subtract the amount of water on the second day from the amount on the third day to get the increase.\n\n```python\n# Water on the first day\ninitial_water = 4000\n\n# Water on the second day (doubled)\nsecond_day_water = 2 * initial_water\n\n# Water on the third day\nthird_day_water = 14000\n\n# Increase in water from the second day to the third day\nincrease_third_day = third_day_water - second_day_water\n\n# Output the result\nprint(increase_third_day)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we find the increase in the volume of water from the second day to the third day."
