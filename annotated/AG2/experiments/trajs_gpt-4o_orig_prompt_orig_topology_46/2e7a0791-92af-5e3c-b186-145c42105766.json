You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We know he completed half of his steps walking to and from school, added another 1,000 from a walk with his friend, and did 500 more steps while shopping. After his jog, he still had 2,000 steps left to complete. To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can calculate the remaining steps needed to reach 10,000 after accounting for what he has already completed.\n\nHere's how we solve it step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of steps Elliott has already completed before his jog.\n2. Subtract the already completed steps and the steps left (after his jog) from the target of 10,000 steps to find out how many steps he took during his jog.\n\nLet's solve this with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\ntotal_steps = 10000\nsteps_left_after_jog = 2000\n\n# Calculate steps Elliot has completed before his jog\nsteps_to_and_from_school = total_steps / 2\nsteps_with_friend = 1000\nsteps_shopping = 500\n\n# Calculate the steps taken during the jog\ncompleted_steps = steps_to_and_from_school + steps_with_friend + steps_shopping\nsteps_during_jog = total_steps - (completed_steps + steps_left_after_jog)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(steps_during_jog)\n```\n\nNow, let's calculate it."
