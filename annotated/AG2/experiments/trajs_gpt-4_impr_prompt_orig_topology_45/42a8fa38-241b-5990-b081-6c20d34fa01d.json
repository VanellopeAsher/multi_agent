Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables. She purchased 20 tomato seed packets and 80 celery seed packets for this purpose. Given that a tomato seed packet is priced at $40 and a celery seed packet is priced at $30, what is the total amount of money she spent on purchasing the seeds?"

      "content": "Given that Mrs. Rylan purchased 20 tomato seed packets at $40 each and 80 celery seed packets at $30 each, we can calculate the total amount of money she spent on purchasing the seeds by multiplying the price of each type of seed packet by the number of packets purchased and adding the two amounts together.\n\nUsing this approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of tomato seeds by multiplying the number of tomato seed packets (20) by their price ($40 per packet).\n2. Calculate the total cost of celery seeds by multiplying the number of celery seed packets (80) by their price ($30 per packet).\n3. Add the total cost of tomato seeds and the total cost of celery seeds to get the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on purchasing the seeds.\n\nLet's compute these calculations using Python.\n\n```python\n# number of seed packets\ntomato_packets = 20\ncelery_packets = 80\n\n# price of each seed packet\ntomato_price = 40\ncelery_price = 30\n\n# total cost of tomato and celery seeds\ntotal_cost_tomato = tomato_packets * tomato_price\ntotal_cost_celery = celery_packets * celery_price\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = total_cost_tomato + total_cost_celery\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThe result of this script will be the total amount Mrs. Rylan has spent on acquiring seeds."

The total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on purchasing the seeds is $3200.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\nThe cost of the tomato seed packets is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.\nThe cost of the celery seed packets is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.\nAdding these two amounts together, we get $800 + $2400 = $3200.\n\nTherefore, the computed answer is correct.\n\nAfter passing all of the verification steps, we can conclude that the total amount Mrs. Rylan spent is \\boxed{3200}, in dollar terms."
