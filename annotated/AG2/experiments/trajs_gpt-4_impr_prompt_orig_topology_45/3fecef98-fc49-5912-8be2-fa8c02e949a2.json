Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed.

Each piece of fabric for the comforter needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed which measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Thus, each comforter piece is (6+2) feet by (8+2) feet. \n\nThe duvet cover fabric piece is 9 feet by 11 feet as given in the problem. \n\nThe total square feet of fabric Jim needs is the sum of the areas of these three fabric pieces. \n\nLet's calculate it step by step:\n\nStep 1: Find the area of each fabric piece for the comforter.\nStep 2: Find the area of the duvet cover fabric piece.\nStep 3: Find the total area by adding the areas of each piece.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the area of each fabric piece for the comforter\ncomforter_length = 6 + 2   # feet\ncomforter_width = 8 + 2    # feet\ncomforter_area = comforter_length * comforter_width   # square feet\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the area of the fabric piece for the duvet cover\nduvet_length = 9   # feet\nduvet_width = 11   # feet\nduvet_area = duvet_length * duvet_width   # square feet\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total area of fabric Jim needs\ntotal_area = 2 * comforter_area + duvet_area\nprint(total_area)\n```\n\nNext, execute the Python code and provide the output of total_area. I will validate the result and let you know whether to proceed."

The dimensions of the fabric piece for the duvet cover are 9 feet by 11 feet. Therefore, this piece has an area of 99 square feet.\n3.
