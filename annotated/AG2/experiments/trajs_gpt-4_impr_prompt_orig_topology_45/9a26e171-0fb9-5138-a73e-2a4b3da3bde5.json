Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home.

Establish that three-fourths of all students have a desktop computer.\n2. Understand that 20 students do not have desktops, and they comprise one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop.\n3. Deduce that six-thirds (or two) of one-fourth of the students don't own either a desktop or a laptop.\n4. Calculate the total number of students.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Step One: Establish that three-fourths of all students have a desktop computer\n\n# Let's assume that total_students represents the total number of students in that grade\n\ntotal_students = sp.symbols('total_students')\n\n# Condition 1: three-fourths of total_students have a desktop computer \n# This means that one-fourth of total_students do not have a desktop computer\n\nnot_have_desktop_students = total_students/sp.Rational(4)\n\n# Step Two: Understand that 20 students do not have desktops, and this number makes up one-third of the students who do not have a desktop or a laptop\n\n# Given that 20 students do not have a desktop\ngiven_students_without_desktop = 20 \n\n# This 20 is one-third of the students who do not have a desktop or a laptop\n# Therefore, three-thirds (or one) of the students without a desktop or a laptop computers is\n\ntotal_students_without_either = given_students_without_desktop * 3\n\n# Step Three: Deduce that two of one-fourth of the students don't own either a desktop or a laptop\n\n# Since not having a desktop is equivalent to not having either a desktop or a laptop\n# We equate total_students_without_either and not_have_desktop_students and solve for total_students\n\ntotal_students_solution = sp.solve(sp.Eq(total_students_without_either, not_have_desktop_students), total_students)\n\nprint(\"The total number of students in that grade is: \", total_students_solution)\n```\n\nThis code block provides the total number of students in that grade level, in response to the given problem's requirements.

So, 25% (one-fourth) of 240 students do not have a desktop computer, which is 60 students.\n4. The problem states that 20 students represent one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer.\n5. Therefore, the total number of students who don't have either a desktop or a laptop is 20 * 3 = 60 students.\n6. Since the number of students without a desktop is equal to the number of students without either a desktop or a laptop, and both equal 60, our total number of students in that grade level (240) is correct.\n\nFinal answer: \nThe total number of students in that grade level is \\boxed{240}."
