Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th.

Since we know that burning 3500 calories equates to losing one pound, we can easily find this total by multiplying 30 lbs by 3500.\n\nSecond, we calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th. This calculation is straightforward because we are using the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFinally, we calculate the daily calorie deficit needed by dividing the total calorie deficit by the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.\n\nThis is how we'll get our answer:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\n\n# calculate total calorie deficit\ntotal_calorie_deficit = 30 * 3500  # lbs * calories/lb\n\n# calculate the total number of days\nstart_date = date(date.today().year, 12, 31)\nend_date = date(date.today().year + 1, 7, 19)\ntotal_days = (end_date - start_date).days\n\n# calculate the daily calorie deficit\ndaily_calorie_deficit = total_calorie_deficit / total_days\n\nprint(daily_calorie_deficit)\n```\n\nPlease calculate this and return the daily calorie deficit."

      "content": "Great! Based on the calculations, to achieve his target weight loss of 30 lbs by July 19th, Andy will need to maintain a daily calorie deficit of \\boxed{525} calories. Let's verify this result.\n\nVerification Steps:\n\n1. Calculating total calorie deficit: We know that burning 3500 calories leads to a weight loss of 1 lb. Thus, to lose 30 lbs, Andy needs a total calorie deficit of 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105000 calories. This calculation is correct.\n\n2. Calculating total days: There are 200 days from December 31st to July 19th (check this on a calendar to confirm). This is correct.\n\n3. Calculating daily calorie deficit: Finally, we found the daily calorie deficit by dividing the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day. This calculation is also correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer of \\boxed{525} calories/day is correct based on these verifications. Good job on this calculation!"
