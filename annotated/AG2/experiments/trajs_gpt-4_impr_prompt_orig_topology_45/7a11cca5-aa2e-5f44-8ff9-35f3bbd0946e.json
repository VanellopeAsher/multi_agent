      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases on the third day so that the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons, calculate the increase amount in the third day."

Subtract the total from the third day's volume to find the increase in the third day.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n```python\n# The initial amount of water flowing through the river\ninitial_volume = 4000\n\n# After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles\nsecond_day_volume = initial_volume * 2\n\n# The total flow in the first two days\ntotal_first_two_days = initial_volume + second_day_volume\n\n# The total flow on the third day given in the problem\nthird_day_total = 14000\n\n# The increase on the third day is the difference between the total flow on the third day and the total flow in the first two days\nthird_day_increase = third_day_total - total_first_two_days\n\n# print the result\nprint(third_day_increase)\n```\n\nThe result of `third_day_increase` will be the increased volume of water on the third day."
