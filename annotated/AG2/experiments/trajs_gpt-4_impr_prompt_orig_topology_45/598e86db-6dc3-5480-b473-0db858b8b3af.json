Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help some people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. He helps 240 people in total.

      "content": "This problem can be solved by first calculating the total number of days Billy works, and then dividing the total number of people he helps by the total number of hours he works. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th, which is 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.\n2. Calculate the total number of days Billy takes off, which is 20% of the total days, i.e., 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.\n3. Subtract the number of days off from the total days to find the number of days Billy works, i.e., 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n4. Since Billy works for 3 hours a day, the total number of hours he works is 3 * 40 = 120 hours.\n5. Finally, divide the total number of people he helps (240) by the total number of hours he works to find the number of people he helps per hour.\n\nLet's implement it in python."
