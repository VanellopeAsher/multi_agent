      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday. On Sundays, she takes a break and doesn't teach any classes. Each class has 15 students. She charges $15.00 per student for each class. Additionally, she offers a free 5-minute warm-up session before each class, which doesn't affect her earnings. How much money does she make in 1 week?"

So, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.\n- 8 classes on Saturday. \n\nSo total classes taught in a week = 25 (Mon to Fri) + 8 (Sat) = 33 classes.\n\nSince each class has 15 students and she charges $15 for each student. The money she earns from each class would be 15 (students) * $15 (rate) = $225.\n\nSo for 33 classes, her earnings would be $225/class * 33 classes. \n\nLet's calculate that using Python code now."

Therefore, she teaches a total of 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes during the weekdays.\n- She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday.\n- Hence, she teaches a total of 25 (Mon-Fri) + 8 (Sat) = 33 classes in a week.\n- Each class consists of 15 students, and she charges each student $15. Therefore, she earns $15/student * 15 students = $225 per class.\n- Considering all 33 classes, she makes $225/class * 33 classes = $7425 in a week.\n\nTherefore, my final - and verified - answer is \\boxed{7425}."
