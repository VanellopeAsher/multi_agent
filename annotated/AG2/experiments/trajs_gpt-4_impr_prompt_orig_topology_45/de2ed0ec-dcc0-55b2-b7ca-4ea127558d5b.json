Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCaroline has 4 children.

Input the height of the first child in inches into the equation \"height_in_feet = height_in_inches / 12\".\n2. Print the result.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# height in inches\nheight_in_inches = 72\n# conversion to feet\nheight_in_feet = height_in_inches / 12\nprint(height_in_feet)\n```\n\nAfter these steps, we should get the height of the first child in feet.

We started with the given that the fourth child is 72 inches tall.\n2. According to our sequential reasoning, we found out that the third child is 3 inches shorter than the fourth child, making them 69 inches tall.\n3. The second child is 5 inches taller than the third child, making them 74 inches tall.\n4. Finally, the first child is 2 inches shorter than the second child, making them 72 inches tall.\n5. We converted the height of the first child from inches to feet using the conversion 1 foot = 12 inches, and we got the height as 6 feet.\n\nSince all our steps have been checked and there's no error in our calculations, our final result is correct. \n\nThe first child is 6.0 feet tall. \n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{6}."
