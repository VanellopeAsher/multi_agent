Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is wrapping Christmas gifts. She has 6 gifts to wrap for her family, 4 gifts to wrap for her friends and 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers. She wants to make a bow for each gift.

However, I can give you a Python formula that can compute the ribbon length for each bow as soon as we have the total inch of ribbon. \n\nHere's the formula:\n\n```python\ndef bow_length(total_ribbon):\n    total_gifts = 6 + 4 + 2  # Total number of gifts\n    length_per_bow = total_ribbon / total_gifts\n    return length_per_bow\n```\n\nWith this function, you can input the total length of ribbon Monica has, and it will calculate the length of ribbon she can use for each gift bow. As a result, without knowing the total length of the ribbon, the exact length per gift remains undefined and is displayed as `None`.\n\nIn this context, `None` simply implies that the final numeric value needs to be calculated once the total length of ribbon is known. So the final length of ribbon per gift Monica can use is \\boxed{None}."
