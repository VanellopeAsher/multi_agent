Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "The problem is a simple linear relationship problem. The ratio of potatoes to hash browns is constant. So, we can determine the number of hash browns made from 960 potatoes by setting up the following proportion:\n\n```\n60 potatoes : 360 hash browns = 960 potatoes : X hash browns\n```\n\nBy cross-multiplication:\n\n```\n60 * X = 960 * 360\n```\n\nThen, simplify:\n\n```\nX = (960 * 360) / 60\n```\n\nNow, let's evaluate this expression to find the value of X which represents the number of hash browns.\n\n```python\n# calculation\nX = (960 * 360) / 60\nprint(X)\n```\nUse this code to calculate the number of hash browns."

      "content": "Great! Therefore, you can make 5760 hash browns out of 960 potatoes.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nVERIFICATION\nThe problem states a direct proportional relationship between the number of potatoes and the number of hash browns. That means, if the number of potatoes increases, the number of hash browns should increase proportionately, and vice-versa.\n\n- We know that 60 potatoes make 360 hash browns.\n- If we increase the number of potatoes 16 times (from 60 to 960), the number of hash browns should also increase 16 times.\n- Let's check: 360 (hash browns from 60 potatoes) times 16 equals 5760, which matches our calculated answer. The solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{5760}."
