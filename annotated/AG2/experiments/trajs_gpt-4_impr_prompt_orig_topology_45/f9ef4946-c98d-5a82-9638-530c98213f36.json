Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework.

      "content": "This problem can be solved by adding the time Frankie spent watching TV for each day. \nFirstly, we need to convert the time he spends watching each show into minutes, and then convert the total minutes into hours. \n\nLet's start by breaking down how much Frankie watches each day:\n\n- On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one one-hour-long episode each day. In minutes, that's 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes) * 2 days = 120 minutes.\n- On Wednesday, he watches three half-hour-long episodes. So he watches for 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.\n- On Thursday, he watches one and a half hours (or 90 minutes) of TV.\n- On Friday, he watches two one-hour-long episodes, for a total of 120 minutes.\n\nAfter we have that breakdown we can total those minutes and then convert the total back into hours.  Let's solve this using python:\n\n```python\ndef time_conversion(minutes):\n    return minutes / 60\n\n# Calculation\ntotal_minutes = 120 + 90 + 90 + 120\ntotal_hours = time_conversion(total_minutes)\n\nprint(total_hours)\n```"

Let's verify the calculations:\n    - On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watches one-hour-long show each day which gives 1 * 2 = 2 hours.\n    - On Wednesday, he watches three half-hour-long episodes. This is 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 hours.\n    - On Thursday, he watches one and a half hours of TV which equals to 1.5 hours.\n    - On Friday, he watches two one-hour-long episodes which equates to 1 * 2 = 2 hours.\n    - Adding these all up gives 2 (Mon & Tue) + 1.5 (Wed) + 1.5 (Thurs) + 2 (Fri) = 7 hours.\n3. These values indicate that the calculations are correct, matching the Python solution.\n\nTherefore, Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours. Our final answer is 7 hours, denoted as \boxed{7}."
