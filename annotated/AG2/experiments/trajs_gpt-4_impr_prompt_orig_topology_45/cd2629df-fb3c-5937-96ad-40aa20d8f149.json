Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

Calculate the total amount paid by Stephen in the first eleven months.\n3. Subtract the total amount paid in the first 11 months from the total borrowed amount to find out how much Stephen will pay in the 12th month.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# initial amount borrowed\namount_borrowed = 300\n\n# interest rate\ninterest_rate = 2/100\n\n# total amount with interest\ntotal_borrowed = amount_borrowed * (1 + interest_rate)\n\n#amount paid per month for 11 months\namount_paid_per_month = 25\ntotal_amount_paid_first_11_months = amount_paid_per_month * 11\n\n# amount to pay in 12th month\namount_to_pay_12th_month = total_borrowed - total_amount_paid_first_11_months\namount_to_pay_12th_month\n```"

Stephen borrowed $300 with an additional 2% interest, which totals to $300 * 1.02 = $306. \n2. For 11 months, Stephen paid his sister $25 per month, i.e., 11 * $25 = $275.\n3. Therefore, in the 12th month, Stephen will pay the remaining amount which is $306 - $275 = $31.\n\nThe calculation matches with the computed answer therefore the $31 which Stephen will pay his sister in the 12th month is correct. \n\nHence, the solution to the problem is $31. \n\nFinally answer is given in the format \boxed{31}, ensuring only numbers are inside."
