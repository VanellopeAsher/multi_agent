Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $3000/month, her credit card's minimum is $2000/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $5000/month.

Begin by calculating the total minimum payment per month by adding all the minimum payments.\n2. Then, find out what 50% more than this value is.\n3. Finally, to find out how much Jessica pays per year, multiply the total monthly payment by 12.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\n```python\n# minimum monthly payments\nstudent_loans = 3000\ncredit_card = 2000\nmortgage = 5000\n\n# total minimum payment per month\ntotal_min_payment = student_loans + credit_card + mortgage\n\n# 50% more than the minimum payment\nincreased_payment = total_min_payment + 0.5 * total_min_payment\n\n# total payment per year\nannual_payment = increased_payment * 12\n\n# print the annual payment\nprint(annual_payment)\n```"
