Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?"

Then, the number of eggs found by their friends can be calculated by subtracting the total number of eggs found by the twins and the remaining eggs from the total number of eggs.\n\nLet's write a Python function to solve it:\n\n```python\ndef eggs_found_by_friends(total_eggs=100): # assuming 100 eggs to be the total eggs for now\n    # Number of eggs one Smith Twin found\n    smith_twin_eggs = 30\n    \n    # Total eggs found by Smith Twins\n    smith_twins_total = 2 * smith_twin_eggs\n    \n    # Remaining eggs\n    remaining_eggs = 10\n    \n    # eggs found by friends\n    friends_eggs = total_eggs - (smith_twins_total + remaining_eggs)\n    \n    return friends_eggs\n\n# Print the number of eggs found by friends\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends(total_eggs=100))\n```\n\nWe still don't know the total number of eggs, which is why it's set to 100 for now.

Then it's mentioned that all other eggs except for 10 were found by their friends. Accepting the interpretation that the twins also found eggs among 'all other eggs', we can elaborate that friends found all of the 'all other eggs' - this count is 30 (total eggs) - 10 (eggs that were not found by anyone). The friends would then have found 20 eggs.\n\nTo confirm, here is the solution in Python:\n```python\ndef calculate_eggs_found_by_friends(total_eggs, twin_eggs_each, unfound_eggs):\n  # Total eggs found by Smith Twins\n  smith_twins_total = 2 * twin_eggs_each\n  # Eggs found by friends\n  friends_eggs = total_eggs - unfound_eggs \n  return friends_eggs\n\n# Total number of eggs\ntotal_eggs = 30\n# Number of eggs found by each of the Smith twins\ntwin_eggs_each = 30\n# Number of unfound eggs\nunfound_eggs = 10\nfriends_eggs = calculate_eggs_found_by_friends(total_eggs, twin_eggs_each, unfound_eggs)\n\nprint(friends_eggs)\n```\nPlease run this code to verify the solution."
