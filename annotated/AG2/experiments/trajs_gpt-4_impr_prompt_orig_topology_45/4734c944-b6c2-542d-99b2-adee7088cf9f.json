Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2.5 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?"

Finally, add the number of wooden figures and plastic figures to get the total number.\n\nAlright, let's begin.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# set the total amount of money\ntotal_amount = 70 \n\n# set the number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7 \n\n# calculate how much Peter spends each day\ndaily_spend = total_amount / days_in_week \n\n# set the cost of wooden and plastic figure\ncost_of_wooden_figure = 5\ncost_of_plastic_figure = 2.5\n\n# calculate how many wooden figures he buys from Sunday through Wednesday\nwooden_figures = sp.floor(daily_spend / cost_of_wooden_figure) * 4 \n\n# calculate how much money he has left\nremaining_money = total_amount - wooden_figures * cost_of_wooden_figure \n\n# calculate how many plastic figures he can afford with the remaining money\nplastic_figures = sp.floor(remaining_money / cost_of_plastic_figure) \n\n# add the number of wooden figures and plastic figures to get the total number\ntotal_figures = wooden_figures + plastic_figures \n\nprint(total_figures)\n```\n\nThe above python code will help to get the total number of action figures that Peter will have by the end of the week.

      "content": "Great! So the total count of the wooden and plastic action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 20.\n\nNow let's do a step by step verification here:\n\n1. First, we calculated the amount that Peter spends each day which is $70 / 7 = $10.\n2. Then, we computed how many wooden figures he can afford to buy from day 1 (Sunday) through day 4 (Wednesday) which is $10 / $5 = 2 figures per day, making it 2*4 = 8 figures in total for 4 days.\n3. As per the remaining money, it's $70 - 8*$5 = $30.\n4. Then, we calculated that with the remaining $30, Peter can buy $30 / $2.5 = 12 plastic figures from day 5 (Thursday) through day 7 (Saturday).\n5. Lastly, we added the total number of wooden figures (8) that Peter bought from Sunday through Wednesday to the total number of plastic figures (12) he bought from Thursday through Saturday, giving us a total of 8 + 12 = 20 figures.\n\nThe result is therefore verified to be 20. \n\nSo, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is \\boxed{20}."
