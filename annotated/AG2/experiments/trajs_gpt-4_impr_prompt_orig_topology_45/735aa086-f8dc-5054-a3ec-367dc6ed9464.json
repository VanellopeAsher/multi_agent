  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

Compute the total weight of hay.\n4. Compute the total weight of oats.\n5. Compute the total weight of all feeds and determine the number of trips required by dividing the total weight by the truck's carrying capacity and rounding up to the nearest integer (since a partial trip still counts as a whole trip).\n6. Present the result.\n\nThe Python code for this solution is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate total weight of each feed\ntotal_sugar_cubes_weight = 20 * 10\ntotal_carrots_weight = 40 * 120\ntotal_hay_weight = 420 * 750\ntotal_oats_weight = 200 * 650\n\n# Calculate total weight of all feeds\ntotal_weight = total_sugar_cubes_weight + total_carrots_weight + total_hay_weight + total_oats_weight\n\n# Calculate number of trips needed, rounding up to nearest whole number\ntrips_required = math.ceil(total_weight / 22500)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, print the result:\n\n```python\nprint(trips_required)\n```"
