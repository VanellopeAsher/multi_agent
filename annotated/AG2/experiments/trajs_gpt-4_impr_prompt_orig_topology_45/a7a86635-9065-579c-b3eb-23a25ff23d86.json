Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

From the problem, we understand that the total number of kids went out is 200 which contains an equal amount of boys and girls which means 100 boys and 100 girls.\n2. Each boy brought back 600 seashells.\n3. Each girl brought back an amount equal to (the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times the number of shells brought by the boys).\n\nThe total seashells brought back by a girl can be calculated by this formula:\nno_of_seashells_per_girl = no_of_seashells_per_boy + 4*no_of_seashells_per_boy\n\nUsing Python, we can directly calculate the no_of_seashells_per_girl:\n\n```python\n# Total number of boys and girls\nno_of_boys = no_of_girls = 100\n\n# Number of seashells brought by each boy\nno_of_seashells_per_boy = 600\n\n# Number of seashells brought by each girl\nno_of_seashells_per_girl = no_of_seashells_per_boy + 4 * no_of_seashells_per_boy\n\nprint(no_of_seashells_per_girl)\n```\n\nThe above Python program will display the number of seashells brought back by each girl."

Given that each boy brought back 600 shells, each girl would have brought back:\n\n600 (seashells from the boys) + 4*600 (four times the seashells of the boys) = 600 + 2400 = 3000\n\nNow, let's cross-verify this:\n\nEach girl bringing back 3000 seashells matches with the output of the computation performed earlier. This step confirms the correctness of the computation and the logic applied.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is correct.\n\nThe number of seashells brought back by each girl is \\boxed{3000}."
