Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved using simple arithmetic operations.\n\nHere's how we can work it out:\n\n- For starts, we know that Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps during his walk to and from school. So, these steps are 10,000/2 = 5,000 steps.\n- Then we know that he did 1,000 steps during a short walk with his friend.\n- He did another 500 steps going shopping.\n\nNow, all these steps need to be summed up and subtracted from the total number of steps that Elliott had to walk before his jog. After that, he realized that he had 2,000 steps left.\n\nThe formula can be written as follows:\n\n```python\nschool_steps = 10000 / 2  #this gives us the steps he walked to and from school\nfriend_walk_steps = 1000  #steps he walked with his friend\nshopping_steps = 500  #steps he walked while shopping\n\n#steps he walked during his jog\njog_steps = 10000 - (school_steps + friend_walk_steps + shopping_steps)\n```\n\nThen print `jog_steps`, which represents the number of steps Elliott took during his jog. \n\nThe difference will get you the number of steps he took during his jog, as it's indeed the only remaining activity, and we can safely assume that the difference represents the jog. \n\nLet's execute this logic using programming."
