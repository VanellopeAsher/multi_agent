Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMrs. Harrington bought several boxes of oranges at the market.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges she will keep for herself.\n3. Finally, subtract the amount of oranges she keeps from the total amount left to find the amount of oranges she sold.\n\nPython Calculation Steps:\n1. To perform the calculation, we'll use simple arithmetic.\n\nHere's the Python code for our computations:\n\n```python\n# one box contains 20 oranges\n\n# Mrs. Harrington gave away 2 boxes to her mom and her sister each\nboxes_given_away = 2 * 2\n\n# since each box contains 20 oranges\noranges_given_away = boxes_given_away * 20\n\n# let's assume that Mrs. Harrington initially bought x boxes\n# after giving oranges away she's left with (x - 4) boxes\n\n# she kept 1/4 of the oranges that were left\n# so, she sold the rest i.e, 3/4 of the oranges that were left\n\n# therefore, she sold 3/4 of (x-4) boxes\n# let's equate this value to the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold\n\n# if Mrs. Harrington sold y oranges then we can form the equation\n# 3/4 * (x-4) * 20 = y\n```\n\nPlease provide the values of x (number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought) and y (number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold) for the solving the equation."

However, I will provide a theoretical solution.\n\nLet's suppose Mrs. Harrington initially bought 'b' boxes of oranges. \n\nStep 1) First, she gave away 2 boxes each to her mom and sister, which amounts to 4 boxes in total. Hence, Mrs. Harrington now has 'b - 4' boxes.\n\nStep 2) Each box contains 20 oranges, so she has '20 * (b - 4)' oranges. Since Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges and sold the rest, she must have sold '3/4 * 20 * (b - 4)' oranges.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate the number of oranges she sold. I will use arbitrary values for calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought\nb = 10 \n\n# Boxes remaining after she gave some to her mom and sister\nboxes_remaining = b - 4\n\n# The number of oranges she has after giving some boxes away\noranges_remaining = 20 * boxes_remaining\n\n# She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges and sold the others\noranges_sold = (3/4) * oranges_remaining\n\nprint(oranges_sold)\n```\n\nThe output will be equal to the number of oranges she sold if Mrs. Harrington initially bought 10 boxes.
