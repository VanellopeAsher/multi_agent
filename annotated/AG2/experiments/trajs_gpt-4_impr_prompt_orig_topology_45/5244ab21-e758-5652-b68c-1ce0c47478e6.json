Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges. She gifted her mother and her sibling two boxes each. She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself and sold the rest. If each box has 20 oranges, can you determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold?"

It's important to not obtain a decimal point because oranges cannot be sold partially."

      "content": "That's correct.\n\nVerification:\nLet's verify the steps:\n1. Mrs. Harrington bought a total of 12 boxes, where each box contains 20 oranges. Hence, she bought a total of 12*20 = 240 oranges.\n2. She gave away 2 boxes to her mother and 2 boxes to her sibling. Hence, she gave away 4 boxes containing 80 oranges.\n3. The number of oranges she had left after giving away some is 240-80 = 160 oranges.\n4. She stored a quarter of this for herself, meaning she stored 160/4 = 40 oranges for herself.\n5. Therefore, she sold the remaining oranges, 160-40 = 120 oranges.\n\nThe python code returns 120.0, which, in the context of this problem, can be considered as 120 since you cannot sell partial oranges.\n\nHence, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{120}."
