Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSam ran 3.5 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5.5 miles.  How many miles did Sam run this week?"

      "content": "This problem can be directly solved using Python. \n\nThe key idea is basic arithmetic operation: addition.\n\nWe just need to simply combine the distances that Sam ran on all these days. For Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Sam ran 3.5 miles each day and on Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5.5 miles each day. \n\nTo compute the total distance, we need to multiply the distance of each day with the number of days it was ran and then add them up. So, we will multiple 3.5 miles by 3 and 5.5 miles by 2, then add.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# defining the distances\ndistance_mwf = 3.5 # distance on Monday, Wednesday and Friday\ndistance_tt = 5.5 # distance on Tuesday and Thursday\n\n# number of days\nno_of_days_mwf = 3 # number of days for Monday, Wednesday and Friday\nno_of_days_tt = 2 # number of days for Tuesday and Thursday\n\n# calculating total distance\ntotal_distance = distance_mwf * no_of_days_mwf + distance_tt * no_of_days_tt\nprint(total_distance)\n```\nPlease execute this python script and provide the output."

So, we multiply 3.5 by 3 to get 10.5 miles.\n- Sam ran 5.5 miles on two days: Tuesday and Thursday. So, we multiply 5.5 by 2 to get 11 miles.\n- Adding these together, 10.5 miles + 11 miles, we arrive at our computed total.\n\nThe answer agrees with our computation in the python script. So, the verification is successful!\n\nHence, Sam ran a total of \boxed{21.5} miles in a week."
