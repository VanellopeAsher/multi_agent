Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSamwell owns an appliance store.

Subtract the sum of smart, analog, and projection TVs from the total amount of TVs sold (40) to get the number of OLED TVs.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the total number of TVs sold\ntotal_tvs = 40\n\n# define the fractions of different types of TVs sold\nsmart_tv_frac = Rational(1,4)\nanalog_tv_frac = Rational(1,8)\nproj_tv_frac = Rational(1,5)\n\n# calculate the number of TVs sold for each type\nsmart_tvs = total_tvs * smart_tv_frac\nanalog_tvs = total_tvs * analog_tv_frac\nproj_tvs = total_tvs * proj_tv_frac\n\n# calculate the number of OLED TVs sold\noled_tvs = total_tvs - (smart_tvs + analog_tvs + proj_tvs)\n\nprint(oled_tvs)\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n- It defines the total number of TVs sold and the fractions of each type of TV sold.\n- It calculates the number of each type of TV sold by multiplying the total by the respective fraction.\n- It then subtracts the sum of smart, analog, and projection TVs from the total to obtain the number of OLED TVs."
