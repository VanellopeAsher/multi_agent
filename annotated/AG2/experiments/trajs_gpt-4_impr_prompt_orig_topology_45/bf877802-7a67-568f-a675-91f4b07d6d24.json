Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3.

      "content": "This is a problem that can be broken down into manageable steps and solved with Python.\n\nApproach:\n1. First, we interpret the problem and convert the text into corresponding calculations. Initially, the angle of the pyramid from the ground from Sahir's house is 32 degrees and the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid.\n2. The sun moves at a speed of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours. This means the total change in angle is 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.\n3. Hence, the resulting angle from the pyramid tip to the sun will be 32 degrees + 50 degrees.\n4. Then, the sun starts moving at a speed of 3 degrees per hour for the next 2 hours, translating to a total change of 3 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 6 degrees. \n5. At this point, the angle from the ground to the sun will be the previous angle (32 degrees + 50 degrees) + 6 degrees.\n\nWe can calculate this using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the initial angle\ninitial_angle = 32\n\n# Calculate the change in angle after 10 hours\nchange_in_angle_10_hours = 5 * 10\n# Calculate the new angle after 10 hours\nnew_angle_10_hours = initial_angle + change_in_angle_10_hours\n\n# Calculate the change in angle after the next 2 hours\nchange_in_angle_2_hours = 3 * 2\n# Calculate the final angle\nfinal_angle = new_angle_10_hours + change_in_angle_2_hours\n\nprint(final_angle)\n```"

We started off with an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.\n2. The sun then moved upward at a speed of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours, which equates to an increase in the angle of 50 degrees. This brought the angle up to 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.\n3. Next, the sun started moving at a speed of 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours. This is equivalent to an increase in the angle of 6 degrees.\n4. Finally, adding this to the earlier angle of 82 degrees results in a total angle of 88 degrees from the ground.\n\nSo, we're confident that the final angle of the sun from the ground (when observed from Sahir's house) will be \boxed{88} degrees."
