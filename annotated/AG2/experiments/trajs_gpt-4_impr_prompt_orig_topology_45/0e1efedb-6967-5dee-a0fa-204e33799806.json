Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26. She utilized a discount voucher that reduced her total by $7. What was the total amount of money my mother expended at the gardening store?"

      "content": "The problem involves a simple arithmetic calculation. The total amount your mother spent can be calculated by first summing up the costs of the pots and the garden soil and then subtracting the discount she received.\n\nHere is a step-by-step Python solution:\n\n1. Define variables for the cost of the pots, the cost of the garden soil, and the discount value.\n2. Compute the total cost by adding the cost of the pots to the cost of the soil.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to determine the final amount spent.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python code below:\n\n```python\n# define the cost for pots, soil, and discount\ncost_pots = 19  # in dollars\ncost_soil = 26  # in dollars\ndiscount = 7  # in dollars\n\n# compute total cost and final amount spent\ntotal_cost = cost_pots + cost_soil\nfinal_amount_spent = total_cost - discount\n\n# print the final amount spent\nprint(final_amount_spent)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give you the total amount your mother spent at the gardening store."
