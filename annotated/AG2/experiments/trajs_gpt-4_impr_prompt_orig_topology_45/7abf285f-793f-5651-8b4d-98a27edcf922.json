Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "Firstly, we need to understand the problem statement. Jessica has three debts: student loan, credit card debt, and mortgage. Additionally, she also has a Netflix subscription. She wants to pay 50% more on her dues (not including the Netflix cost) and needs to calculate how much she spends per year. \n\nLet's break down this problem:\n\n1. We first need to calculate the minimum payment Jesssica has to make on all her debts monthly. This can be obtained by summing up the given individual minimum payments.\n2. Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the minimum payment and add it to the minimum payment to obtain the monthly payment that Jessica is planning. \n3. Finally, to find out the annual payment, we need to multiply the monthly payment by 12.\n\nLet's implement these steps using Python."

      "content": "After calculating according to the steps, it appears that Jessica would pay a total of $18,000 towards all her debts in a year. To further validate this, let's plug in the numbers step by step:\n\n1. The combined monthly minimum payment for Jessica's student loan, credit card, and mortgage is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.\n2. Jessica plans to pay an additional 50% of the minimum, which amounts to - 0.5 * $1000 = $500.\n3. Adding the extra to the minimum, the total monthly payment Jessica plans to pay is $1000 + $500 = $1500.\n4. Hence, the total amount she plans to pay in a year is $1500 * 12 = $18000.\n\nSince our calculation matches the provided answer, we can conclude that Jessica would pay a total of $18,000 towards all her debts in a year.\n\nAccordingly, the final answer is \\( \\boxed{18000} \\)."
