Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "Given the problem, we are supposed to find the age of Carver's son.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nWe can establish a simple linear equation to solve this issue. Let's denote the son's age as x. \"Twice the son's age\" then becomes 2x, and \"8 years less than twice the son's age\" becomes 2x - 8. Given that Carver's age is 60 years old, the equation becomes 2x - 8 = 60.\n\nWe can solve this equation for x, which will represent Carver's son's age, using python and the sympy package. The sympy package is suitable for dealing with algebraic equations and supports the simplification of solutions in a human-readable way.\n\nHere is the python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\nequation = Eq(2*x - 8, 60)\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\nprint(\"The son's age is\", solution[0])\n```\n\nWe just have to run this code, and we will have the answer to Carver's son's age."

Subtract 8 years from the calculated value: 68 - 8 = 60 years old.\n3. It is confirmed that this value matches Carver's actual age. Hence, we have verified that our solution is correct.\n\nSo, based on the problem statement and our calculations, Carver's son is \\boxed{34} years old."
