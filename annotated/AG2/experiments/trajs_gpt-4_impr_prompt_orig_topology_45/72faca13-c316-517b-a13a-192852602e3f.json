      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents, how many cents will she have left?"

Calculate the amount of money spent on the can of pop and the candy bar in cents.\n3. Subtract the total spent from the initial total to find out how much money is left.\n\nLet's compute each step in Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate total initial value\nquarters = 5\ndimes = 2\ntotal_initial = quarters * 25 + dimes * 10\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total value spent\npop = 55\ncandy_bar = 45\ntotal_spent = pop + candy_bar\n\n# Step 3: Calculate remaining value\ntotal_remaining = total_initial - total_spent\nprint(total_remaining)\n```\n\nYou can follow these steps and execute the given code snippet to proceed with your computations."
