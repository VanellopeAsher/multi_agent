Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

      "content": "The key concept in this problem is cost per class. Manny's classes can be more than $10 and his parents have set a limit. Therefore, we are looking at how many classes Manny can afford to miss while maintaining an average cost of $10 or less per class.\n\nSolution Approach:\nLet's calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can miss.\n\nLet 'x' be the number of Karate classes Manny attends. The cost per class will be $60 / x. This needs to be less than or equal to $10 since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. \n\nSo,\n\n60 / x <= 10\n\nRearranging the inequality gives us:\n\nx >= 60 / 10\nx >= 6\n\nThis means Manny needs to attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at $10 or under. Since there are 10 classes in total, he can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes.\n\nLet's formally calculate this."

      "content": "So, Manny can afford to miss \\boxed{4} karate classes before the $10 per class cost is exceeded.\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\nTo verify that the answer is correct, we should plug the number of attended classes back into the original equation and see if the cost per class stays at or below $10.\n\nThe number of classes Manny attends is 10 - 4 = 6. The cost of each class would then be $60/6 = $10. This price per class is not greater than the limit set by Manny's parents, so our answer of 4 missed classes is verified and correct."
