Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \n48 people are riding a bus.

      "content": "Based on the information provided, we can seamlessly solve this problem with Python. \n\nTo compute the remaining number of bus passengers, let's follow these steps:\n1. Subtract the passengers who get off at the first stop from the initial quantity of passengers.\n2. Add the number of passengers who get on at the first stop to the new quantity of passengers.\n3. Deduct the passengers who subsequently get off before the bus departs.\n4. Subtract the passengers who get off at the second stop from the resultant quantity of passengers.\n5. Add the number of passengers who get on at the second stop to the new quantity of passengers.\n\nHere's how we can do that in Python:\n\n```python\n# initial passenger count\ninit_passengers = 48  \n\n# first stop operations\npassengers_get_off_1 = 8  \npassengers_get_on_1 = 5 * passengers_get_off_1  \npassengers_get_off_again_1 = 2  \n\n# update passenger count after first stop\nremaining_passengers = (init_passengers - passengers_get_off_1 + passengers_get_on_1 - passengers_get_off_again_1)\n\n# second stop operations\npassengers_get_off_2 = 21  \npassengers_get_on_2 = passengers_get_off_2 // 3  \n\n# update passenger count after second stop\nremaining_passengers = remaining_passengers - passengers_get_off_2 + passengers_get_on_2  \n\n# print final remaining passenger count\nprint(remaining_passengers)  \n```\n\nPlease run this code and provide the outputs.

      "content": "VERIFICATION\n\nLet's review the calculations step by step:\n\n1. The bus started with 48 passengers.\n2. On the first stop, 8 passengers got off, leaving 40 passengers on the bus.\n3. Then, 5 times the number of passengers who just got off boarded the bus, which means 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80 passengers were on the bus.\n4. However, 2 people who just got on decided to leave, totaling 78 passengers prior to departure.\n5. On the second stop, 21 passengers got off, leaving 57 passengers on the bus.\n6. Subsequently, 3 times fewer passengers got on the bus than those who got off, amounting to 21 / 3 = 7 passengers. This increased the total to 64 passengers.\n\nAfter running the calculation, the Python code successfully provided the answer, which matches our separate verification. Thus, we can confidently present this as our final solution. \n\nTherefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 64.\n\nHence, the final solution is \\boxed{64}."
