Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16. What will be her age after 4 years?"

      "content": "Approach:\nThe straightforward approach to solve this problem is via a direct Python solution, \nutilizing a simple mathematical calculation. \n\nGiven that Charmaine is set to turn 16 in 12 years, \nwe can first calculate her current age by subtracting 12 years from 16 years. \nThen, by adding 4 years to her current age, we can determine her age in 4 years.\n\nHere's how we can do this:\n\n```python\n# calculate Charmaine's current age\ncurrent_age = 16-12\n\n# calculate her age in 4 years\nage_in_4_years = current_age + 4\n\nprint(age_in_4_years)\n```\n\nLet's compute this!"

Four years from now, her age would be current age + 4\n4. That results in 4 + 4 = 8 years.\n\nFrom the verification steps we can see that the Python computation and the manual verification align correctly. Therefore, we can confidently say the solution is correct. \n\nHence, the final answer is \\boxed{8}."
