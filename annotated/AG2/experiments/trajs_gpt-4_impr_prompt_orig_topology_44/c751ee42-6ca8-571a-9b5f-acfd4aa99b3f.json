Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn goes shopping and buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

Compute the total cost for the food items, which are milk (2 dollars), eggs (3 dollars), a pack of cookies (2 dollars), and a bottle of water (1 dollar). This gives 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 8 dollars.\n2. Compute the total cost for the non-food items, which are light bulbs (3 dollars), cups (3 dollars), and roach traps (4 dollars). This gives 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.\n3. Compute the tax for the non-food items. Given a 10% tax rate, compute 10% of 10 dollars, which equals 1 dollar.\n4. Add all these amounts: the total cost of food items (8 dollars), the total cost of non-food items (10 dollars), and the tax (1 dollar). The result is 8 + 10 + 1 = 19 dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all items John bought is \\boxed{19} dollars. This is consistent with our earlier computation, so the final answer is correct."
