Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. Each bag of wheat weighs 60 pounds. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?"

      "content": "Let's solve this problem by finding the total cost the trader spent on buying and transporting each bag, and then using the total profit to determine how many bags he sold.\n\nHere's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Find the total cost the trader spent on buying and transporting each bag.\n2. Subtract the total cost from the selling price to find the profit per bag.\n3. Divide the total profit by the profit per bag to find the number of bags sold.\n\nStep 1: Calculating the Total Cost Per Bag\nThe total cost of getting each bag is the cost of buying it plus the cost of transportation. This is $20 (price per bag) + $2 (transportation cost per bag) = $22.\n\nStep 2: Calculating the Profit Per Bag\nThe profit made from selling each bag is the selling price minus the cost price per bag. This is $30 (selling price per bag) - $22 (total cost per bag) = $8.\n\nStep 3: Calculating the Number of Bags Sold\nThe number of bags sold by the trader is the total profit divided by the profit per bag. Given that the total profit is $400 and the profit per bag is $8, we can divide $400 by $8 to find the number of bags sold. \n\nLet's calculate this in Python:"
