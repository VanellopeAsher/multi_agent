Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark has $50.5 in his bank account. He earns $12.5 per day at his work. If he wants to buy a bike that costs $300.5, how many days does Mark have to save his money?"

      "content": "Required Key Idea or Concept:\n\nThis math problem is simple enough that we can use direct calculation to solve it. The number of days Mark has to save his money can be gotten by the difference between the cost of the bike and the money he has, then dividing by the money he earns per day.\n\nPython Solution:\n\nWe can use Python to do the calculation by subtracting the amount Mark has in his account from the cost of the bike then dividing the difference by how much he earns per day using the formula:\n\n`(cost of bike - money Mark has) รท Mark's daily earning`\n\n```python\n# import sympy for easier math calculation\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# initial amount in Mark's account\ninitial_amount = 50.5\n\n# Mark's daily earning\ndaily_earning = 12.5\n\n# cost of the bike Mark wants to buy\ncost_of_bike =  300.5\n\n# calculate the number of days Mark has to save his money\nnum_days = (cost_of_bike - initial_amount) / daily_earning\n\n# output the result\nprint(num_days)\n```\n\nThis Python code will output the number of days Mark has to work to buy the bike. Remember, if the result is a decimal value, Mark will need to work the whole number of days and part of the next day to have enough money. For instance, if the result is 19.9, it means that Mark will need to work for 20 days to afford the bike.\n\nIs there any information missing to solve this problem? The problem is well-defined and can be solved with the provided information."
