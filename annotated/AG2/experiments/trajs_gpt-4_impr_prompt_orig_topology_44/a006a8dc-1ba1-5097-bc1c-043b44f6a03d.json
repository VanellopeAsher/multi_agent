Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

B = 20/2 = 10\n  2. S_b = 60\n  3. S_g = S_b + 4.5 * S_b \n\nThe problem asks for the value of S_g. Let's compute this  using the provided information:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the number of boys and girls\nB = 10\n\n# Define the number of shells each boy brought back\nS_b = 60\n\n# Define the equation for the number of shells each girl brought back\nS_g = S_b + 4.5 * S_b\n\nprint(S_g)\n```"

The problem states that \"girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys.\"\n- This translates to the equation S_g = S_b + 4.5 * S_b, which was used in the computation. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n- Each boy brought back 60 seashells, and given the relationship, calculation suggests each girl brought back 330 seashells.\n- This answer is logical and possible â€” girls could have collected more seashells than boys, given the assumption provided in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the verified answer is that each girl brought back \boxed{330} seashells."
