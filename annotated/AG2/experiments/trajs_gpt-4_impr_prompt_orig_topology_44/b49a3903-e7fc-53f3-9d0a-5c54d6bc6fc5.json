Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

If he can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row and he buys 30 yellow tulips, how many total rows of flowers will he plant?"

He can fit 6 red tulips in a row, 8 blue tulips in a row, and 5 yellow tulips in a row. He decides to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips.\n\nWe know:\n- He has 36 red tulips, which means he will have 36/6 = 6 rows of red tulips.\n- He has 24 blue tulips, which means he will have 24/8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n- He wants to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips. So there will be (6+3-1=8) rows of spaced-out red and blue rows, meaning 8 rows of yellow tulips.\n- But he only has 30 yellow tulips, which means he can only plant up to 30/5 = 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n\nLet's write this in Python code."
