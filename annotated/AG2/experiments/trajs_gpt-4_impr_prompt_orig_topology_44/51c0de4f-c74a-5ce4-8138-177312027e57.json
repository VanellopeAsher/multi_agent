Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity.

      "content": "Approach:\n\nIt seems that the problem requires little or no coding. Walter gathered money from three sources: his neighbors, an online fund, and his friend. Walter's lawyer agreed to donate three times the amount he collected from his neighbors, the online fund, and his friend. The lawyer's donation is given, and we need to determine the friend's contribution. We can use a reasoning-based solution to solve this problem because it doesn't require any complex programming. Here's how we're going to solve it:\n\n1. We'll add the amount that Walter got from his neighbors and online fund, which should be $500 + $1500 = $2000.\n2. We know the lawyer contributed three times the amount that Walter got from his neighbors, the online fund, and his friend. If we denote the friend's contribution as x, then we have the equation $2000 + x = $6600/3.\n3. Solving the equation will give us the friend's contribution. \n\nLet's execute these steps!"
