On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour than brfore. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.

Find the difference in dollars between Billy and Sally.\n\nLet's solve step by step.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# step 1: calculate Billy's hourly rate\nbilly_start_rate = 10 #Billy was paid at a rate of $10 per hour at first\nbilly_2months_rate = billy_start_rate+0.5 #After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour\nbilly_1year_rate = billy_2months_rate+1 #On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour\n\n# step 2: calculate Sally's hourly rate\nsally_start_rate = billy_start_rate + 0.5 #Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was\nsally_2months_rate = sally_start_rate + 0.5 #After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour\n\n# step 3: compare the earnings of Billy and Sally after working 20 hours\nbilly_earnings = 20*billy_1year_rate\nsally_earnings = 20*sally_2months_rate\n\n# step 4: find the difference in dollars between Billy and Sally\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\ndifference\n```\n\nThis script will result in the number of dollars Billy makes more than Sally after both working 20 hours."
