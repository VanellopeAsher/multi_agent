Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help some people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. He helps 240 people in total.

      "content": "First, compute the number of days between March 1st and April 19th, and then calculate the working days by removing the 20% off days. Afterwards, divide by the total number of people he has helped.\n\nVerification Steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.\n2. Multiply it by 20% to get the number of off days.\n3. Get the working days by substracting the off days from the total days.\n4. Calculate total working hours by multiplying the working hours per day (which is 3) by the total working days.\n5. Divide the total number of people he has helped by the total working hours.\n\nLet's calculate these steps in the code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Calculate the number of days from March 1st to April 19th\ntotal_days = 31 + 19  # 31 days in March and 19 days in April\n\n# Calculate 20% of total_days\noff_days = total_days * 0.20\n\n# Calculate working days\nworking_days = total_days - off_days\n\n# Calculate total working hours\ntotal_working_hours = working_days * 3  # 3 hours per day\n\n# Billy helped 240 people in total\ntotal_people_helped = 240\n\n# Calculate how many people Billy helps per hour\npeople_per_hour = total_people_helped / total_working_hours \n\n# Use fraction form for answer\npeople_per_hour = Rational(people_per_hour).limit_denominator()\n\npeople_per_hour\n```\n\nThe final step retrieves the amount of people Billy helps per hour. This uses Python's 'Rational' function to present the answer in fraction form. The 'limit_denominator(100)' function is added to limit the denominator of the fraction to be no more than 100, making the result more readable.
