Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

From there, we can figure out how many $10 bills Ali had, given that we already know he had six $20 bills.\n\nLet's put that into Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# let x be the number of $10 bills Ali originally had\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Ali has $32 after buying dinner\nafter_dinner = 32  \n\n# before buying dinner, Ali had 5/3 of what he had after dinner\nbefore_dinner = after_dinner * 5 / 3\n\n# before giving his sister half of his money, Ali had twice of what he had before dinner\ntotal_money = before_dinner * 2\n\n# the amount of total money also equals to $10*x + $20*6\nequation = Eq(10*x + 20*6, total_money)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# output the result\nprint(\"Original $10 bills:\", solution[0])\n```\n\nLet's run the program and verify the result."

The result indicates a negative number of $10 bills, which is not possible.\n\nLet's take a step back and review our logic and equation. We have:\n1. $32 equals to 2/5 of the amount of money before buying dinner.\n2. The money before buying dinner is half of the total money Ali originally saved. \n3. The total money Ali originally saved equals to $10*x + $20*6.\n\nAfter a second thought about the above logic, I realize that the problem is with step 1. In this step, I should use 2/5 not 5/3. Therefore, let's correct this step and try again.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# let x be the number of $10 bills Ali originally had\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Ali has $32 after buying dinner\nafter_dinner = 32  \n\n# before buying dinner, Ali had 5/2 of what he had after dinner\nbefore_dinner = after_dinner * 5 / 2\n\n# before giving his sister half of his money, Ali had twice of what he had before dinner\ntotal_money = before_dinner * 2\n\n# the amount of total money also equals to $10*x + $20*6\nequation = Eq(10*x + 20*6, total_money)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# output the result\nprint(\"Original $10 bills:\", solution[0])\n```\nLet's run this program and see if we get a valid result."
