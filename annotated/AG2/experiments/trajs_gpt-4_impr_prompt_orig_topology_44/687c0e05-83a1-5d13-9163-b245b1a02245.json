Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "Alright, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let's use equation (2), which states that the number of female unicorns in Scotland equals twice the number of male unicorns in Scotland. This is given as 6 unicorns, which we can use to solve for the number of males.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nU_male_Scotland = symbols('U_male_Scotland')\n\n# equation 2\neq2 = Eq(2*U_male_Scotland, 6)\n\nU_male_Scotland_solution = solve(eq2, U_male_Scotland)[0]\nprint('Number of male unicorns in Scotland:', U_male_Scotland_solution)\n```\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of unicorns in Scotland (U_Scotland). As we know that the number of males represents one-third of the total, we can write the following equation and solve for U_Scotland:\n\n```python\nU_Scotland = symbols('U_Scotland')\n\n# equation 1\neq1 = Eq(U_male_Scotland_solution, U_Scotland/3)\n\nU_Scotland_solution = solve(eq1, U_Scotland)[0]\nprint('Total number of unicorns in Scotland:', U_Scotland_solution)\n```\n\nFinally, we can use equation (3) to find the total number of unicorns worldwide (U_total). We know that the number in Scotland represent one-third of the total, so we can write the following equation and solve for U_total:\n\n```python\nU_total = symbols('U_total')\n\n# equation 3\neq3 = Eq(U_Scotland_solution, U_total/3)\n\nU_total_solution = solve(eq3, U_total)[0]\nprint('Total number of unicorns worldwide:', U_total_solution)\n```"

Both these values match the given problem conditions.\n\nSo the solution seems reliable. Therefore, based on calculations and verification, I can confidently state that the total number of unicorns worldwide is $\\boxed{27}$."
