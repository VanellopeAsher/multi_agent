Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.

Calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica originally has by assuming each box of pre-made Valentine's cards contains 10 cards.\n2.

So, she started with 20 (her creations) + 20 (2 boxes with 10 cards each) = 40 cards.\n\n2. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so a total of 29 cards were passed out.\n\n3. Erica then got 17 cards in return from family and friends.\n\n4. The number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has at the end of the day is computed by subtracting the number of cards she passed out from the total original number of cards she had, and then adding the cards she received. This gives us 40 (original cards) - 29 (cards passed out) + 17 (cards received) = 28 cards.\n\nTherefore, the final number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has is \\boxed{28}."
