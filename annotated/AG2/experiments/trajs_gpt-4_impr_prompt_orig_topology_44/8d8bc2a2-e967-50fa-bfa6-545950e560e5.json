Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGeorge needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000.5. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?"

A step-by-step computation by Python can be utilized.\n\nThe whole process can be divided into these major steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work using given costs and quantities.\n2. Subtract the amount already paid (the deposit) from the total cost.\n3. Divide the remaining cost by George's hourly wage to get the hours he needs to work.\n\nIt is important to remember that George cannot work fractional hours, so the final number should be rounded up to the next whole number. This is because if the computed hours include a fraction, George would not have earned enough money in those hours to cover the cost, thus he would have to work for one more hour.\n\nCan you provide the values to proceed with these calculations? Note that the deposit value is already given as $600."

We need to ensure to round up the calculated hours to the nearest whole number as George cannot work partial hours.\n\nThe calculations are as follows:\n\n1. Total cost of dental work: `2 * $2000.5 + $500.5`\n2. Subtract the deposit: `total cost - $600`\n3. Divide by hourly wage and round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nNow we can use Python to compute the actual numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# cost of basic implant is $2000.5\nbasic_implant_cost = 2000.5\n\n# cost of porcelain crown addition is $500.5\ncrown_cost = 500.5\n\n# George's deposit is $600\ndeposit = 600\n\n# George's hourly wage is $15.3\nhourly_wage = 15.3\n\n# total cost of dental work is cost of 2 basic implants + cost of 1 crown\ntotal_cost = 2 * basic_implant_cost + crown_cost\n\n# cost after subtracting deposit\nremaining_cost = total_cost - deposit\n\n# number of hours George needs to work is the remaining cost divided by hourly wage\n# we round up to the nearest whole number using the math.ceil function\nhours_needed = math.ceil(remaining_cost / hourly_wage)\n\nprint(hours_needed)\n```\n\nBy running this python code, we can calculate how many hours George needs to work to get enough money for his dental work."
