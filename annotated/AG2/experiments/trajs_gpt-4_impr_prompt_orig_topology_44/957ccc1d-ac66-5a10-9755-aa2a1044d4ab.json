Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?"

      "content": "Approach:\nFirst, we calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th. Then, we calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 pounds, which could be found by multiplying the number of pounds by the number of calories needed to lose a pound. Lastly, we divide the total calorie deficit by the total number of days to obtain the daily calorie deficit. \n\nStep by Step Process:\n1. Calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th.\n2. Calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 pounds.\n3. Divide the total calorie deficit by the total number of days.\n\nThe Python code for these steps follows:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# define date format\nfmt = '%B %d'\n\n# define the start and end dates\nstart_date = datetime.strptime('December 31', fmt)\nend_date = datetime.strptime('July 19', fmt)\n\n# calculate the total number of days\n# add 1 because both the start and end dates are inclusive\ntotal_days = (end_date - start_date).days + 1\n\n# calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 pounds\ntotal_deficit = 30 * 3500\n\n# calculate the daily calorie deficit\ndaily_deficit = total_deficit / total_days\n\nprint(daily_deficit)\n```"
