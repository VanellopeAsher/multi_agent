Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day. He worked for an entire week and saved a total of $110. How much did he spend?"

      "content": "This is a direct Python solution problem because all the required values have been provided and we can solve it using simple subtraction.\n\nHere's what we know:\nGerald earns $30 every day and he worked for an entire week (7 days), so his total earnings are $30/day * 7days = $210. He saved $110. To find out how much he spent, we need to subtract his savings from his total earnings.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this calculation. \n\n```python\ntotal_earnings = 30 * 7 # Gerald's total earnings\nsavings = 110 # Gerald's savings\n\n# calculating the spending\nspending = total_earnings - savings\nprint(spending)\n```"

He worked for an entire 7-day week, so his total earnings are $30/day * 7 days = $210.\n3. He saved $110 after that week.\n4. To find out how much he spent, we subtract his savings from his total earnings: $210 - $110 = $100.\n\nThis verifies our initial calculation.\nTherefore, Gerald spent $100 over the week.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{100}."
