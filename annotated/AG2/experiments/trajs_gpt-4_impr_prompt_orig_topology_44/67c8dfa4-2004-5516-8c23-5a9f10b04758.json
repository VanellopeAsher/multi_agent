Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTara bought several packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. She painted them and sold them at a craft fair for $8 each. If she earned a profit of $160 on her bags, how many packs of 5 canvas bags Tara buy?"

      "content": "Approach:\n\nThis is a problem that can be solved with algebraic equations. \n\nFirst we need to understand the relationship between cost, profit, and selling price. In this case, the profit Tara earned is equal to the total selling price of the bags minus the total cost of the bags. \n\nOur next task is to build an equation from the above relation.\n\nLet's denote:\nB = number of bags\nP = number of packs\n\nGiven: \n\n- $4 is the cost per bag\n- $8 is the selling price per bag\n- $160 is the profit \n- Each pack has 5 bags\n\nWe can express the total cost (T_cost) of the bags as:\nT_cost = $4 * B = $4 * 5 * P  (since B = 5 * P)\n\nSimilarly, we can express the total selling price (T_sell) as:\nT_sell = $8 * B = $8 * 5 * P (since B = 5 * P)\n\nThe difference between the total selling price and total cost is the profit:\nProfit = T_sell - T_cost = $160\n\nThus, we can set up the equation as:\n\n$8 * 5 * P - $4 * 5 * P = $160\n\nWe can solve this equation to find P, which represents the number of packs that Tara bought. \n\nNow, let's implement this in Python code. \n\n\n\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# declare the symbol\nP = symbols('P')\n\n# equation\neqn = Eq(8 * 5 * P - 4 * 5 * P, 160)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(eqn, P)[0]\n\nprint(f\"The number of packs Tara bought is: {solution}\")\n```\nThe 'Eq' function is used to equate the two expressions and form an equation, and the 'solve' function is used to solve the equation. Then we output the solution. The '[0]' at the end of the 'solution' is used to fetch the first (and in this case, only) result from the list of solutions returned by 'solve'."

      "content": "Verification:\n\nNow let's verify our solution by substituting the value of P (number of packs) back into our equation and checking if the profit is equal to $160.\n\n8 * 5 * 8  (selling price of 8 packs) = $320\n4 * 5 * 8  (cost price of 8 packs) = $160\n\nSo, the profit would be the selling price minus the cost price, which equals $320 - $160 = $160, which matches the profit given in the problem. With this verification, I am confident that the solution is correct.\n\nFinal Answer: \n\nSo, Tara bought \boxed{8} packs of 5 canvas bags."
