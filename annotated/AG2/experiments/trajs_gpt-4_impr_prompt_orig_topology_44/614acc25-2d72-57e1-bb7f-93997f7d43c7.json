Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLast night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?"

We know that Rick killed ten wolves and some number of cougars (let's represent that as 'c').\n\nSo, for the first day, the equation will be:\n\n```python\n# Day 1\nwolves_day1 = 10\ncougars_day1 = c # this is unknown\ntotal_animals_day1 = wolves_day1 + cougars_day1\n```\n\nStep 2: For the second day, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. Hence, the equations for the second day will be:\n\n```python\n# Day 2\ncougars_day2 = cougars_day1 - 3\nwolves_day2 = 3 * cougars_day2\ntotal_animals_day2 = wolves_day2 + cougars_day2\n```\n\nStep 3: We need to find the total number of animals Rick killed, which is the sum of the total animals from day 1 and day 2.\n\n```python\n# Total animals\ntotal_animals = total_animals_day1 + total_animals_day2\n```\n\nHowever, we don't know the value of 'c' (the number of cougars Rick killed on the first day). Please provide this information. Without it, the total number of animals Rick killed cannot be accurately calculated."

Let's proceed to solve the problem.\n\nWe still need to find out the number of cougars killed on the first day ('c'), but we also have an equation from the second day that relates the number of cougars and wolves. Specifically, the number of wolves is three times the number of cougars on the second day. \n\nWe also know that the number of cougars on the second day is three less than on the first day.\n\nWe can express this as an equation as follows:\n\nDay 2: \n- wolves = 3 * (cougars_day1 - 3)\n- cougars = cougars_day1 - 3\n\nThis gives us a system of two equations with one unknown, namely 'c', the number of cougars on day 1.\n\nBut there is no unique solution to this problem as it stands because c can take any positive integer value.\n\nIn terms of a query, there is missing information: the number of cougars Rick killed on the first day. Without these details, the problem cannot be definitively solved.\n\nSo for now, the answer is: \\boxed{'None'}.\n"
