      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?"

He delivered 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu that he delivered to Ms. Thompson, so we can multiply 84 by 1/3 to obtain the messages he delivered to Mr. Yu.\n\nFinally, add the messages he delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu together to acquire the total delivered messages.\n\nLet's put that into Python code:\n\n```python\n# Messages delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_thompson = 84\n\n# Messages delivered to Mr. Yu, which is 1/3rd of messages_thompson\nmessages_yu = messages_thompson * (1 / 3)\n\n# Compute total messages delivered\ntotal_messages = messages_thompson + messages_yu\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_messages)\n  ```\n\nPlease compute the above Python code to obtain the total number of delivered messages."

So, that makes 84*(1/3) = 28 messages.\n3) Therefore, the total messages delivered are 84 (Ms. Thompson) + 28 (Mr. Yu) = 112 messages.\n\nEverything looks correct.\n\nSo, the total number of messages James delivers is \\boxed{112}."
