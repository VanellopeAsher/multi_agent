Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

Find out the total days between March 1st and April 19th, and calculate the total working days by subtracting the off days (20% of total days).\n2. Calculate the total number of people Billy could help by multiplying the total working days by the number of people he can help per day. Billy can help 2 persons per hour and he works 3 hours a day, so he can help 2*3 = 6 people per day.\n3. In the end, determine the total amount of caffeine Billy has consumed when he takes a 15-minute break every hour to drink a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine. Billy works 3.5 hours a day (3 hour helping and 0.5 hours organizing paperwork), so he drinks 3.5 cups of coffee each day.\n\nLet's implement this in Python."

Billy works 80% of these days so he works for 0.8*50 = 40 days.\n\nStep 2:\nBilly can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so in a day he can help 2*3 = 6 people. So, in 40 work days, he can help 6*40 = 240 people. \n\nStep 3:\nHe also drinks 3.5 cups of coffee each day and each cup contains 95 milligrams of caffeine so in a day he takes 3.5*95 = 332.5 milligrams of caffeine. So, in 40 work days, he consumes 332.5*40 = 13300 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nSo the calculated values have been verified and are correct."
