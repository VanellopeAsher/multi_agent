      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

Determine the number of grams of protein in 1 gram of mushrooms.\n2. Using the proportion gotten from the first step, calculate the number of grams of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n3. Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to determine the weekly protein intake.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate.\n\n```python\n# weight of mushrooms\nweight_mushroom_cup = 150 # in grams\n\n# amount of protein in one cup of mushrooms\nprotein_mushroom_cup = 4  # in grams\n\n# Daily consumption of mushrooms by John\ndaily_mushroom_intake = 300 # in grams\n\n# Finding the amount protein in one gram of mushrooms\nprotein_per_gram = protein_mushroom_cup / weight_mushroom_cup # in grams\n\n# Finding the amount protein  in the daily intake of mushrooms\ndaily_protein_intake = protein_per_gram * daily_mushroom_intake # in grams\n\n# Calculate the total protein intake for a week, 7 days\nweekly_protein_intake = daily_protein_intake * 7\n\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```"
