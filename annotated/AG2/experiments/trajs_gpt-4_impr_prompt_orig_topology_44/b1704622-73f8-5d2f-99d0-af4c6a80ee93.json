      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours. He then works double that duration on Wednesday. On Thursday, he puts in 2 hours less than his Wednesday's work hours. What is the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved by simple addition and multiplication operations.\n\nThe approach is as follows:\n- Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday.\n- He works double the amount on Wednesday. Therefore, that will be 2*5 = 10 hours.  \n- He works 2 hours less on Thursday compared to Wednesday. Therefore, that will be 10 - 2 = 8 hours.  \n\nAdding all these together yields the total hours Bruce has worked over the three days.\n\nHere's the Python code for it:\n\n```python\n# defining the working hours on Tuesday\ntuesday_hours = 5 \n\n# working hours on Wednesday is double the hours on Tuesday\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\n\n# working hours on Thursday is two hours less than Wednesday\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# total hours worked is the sum of hours worked on each day\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\n\nprint(total_hours)\n```\nThis code will give us the total hours that Bruce worked over Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday."
