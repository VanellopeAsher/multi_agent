Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "Approach:\nThe problem can be solved by setting up equations. Let's denote the total time John spent on activities as T. \n\n1. We know he spent 6 hours boating and 3 hours (half of 6 hours) swimming. This adds up to 9 hours.\n\n2. He also attended three shows, each lasting 2 hours, so that's another 6 hours.\n\n3. This total of 15 hours (boating + swimming + shows) amounts to 30% of his total time. We can set up the following equation:\n   0.3 * T = 15\n   Solving this equation will let us know the total time John spent, not including breaks.\n\n4. Once we know the total time T, we can find out how much time he spent sightseeing because we are told this was 40% of the total time.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python."

Calculation of total time from activities: 30% of total time amounts to 15 hours of activities (boating, swimming, shows). So, total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.\n\n2. Calculation of sightseeing time: 40% of John's total time was spent sightseeing. Therefore, sightseeing time = 40% * 50 hours = 20 hours.\n\nThe verification shows that the calculations are correct.\n\nHence, John spent \\boxed{20} hours sightseeing."
