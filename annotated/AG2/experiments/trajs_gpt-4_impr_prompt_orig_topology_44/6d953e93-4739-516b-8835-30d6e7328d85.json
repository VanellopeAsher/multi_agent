Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "In order to solve this problem, we will have to use Python to solve a simple equation. We can establish the following equation based on the given information:\n\ntotal_Thursday = rate_truck * number_truck + rate_car * number_car\ntotal_Friday = rate_car * number_car_Friday\n\nWe know the rate for each type of tire, the number of tires repaired on Thursday, and the earnings difference between Thursday and Friday.\nTherefore, we can calculate total_Thursday and total_Friday, and equate them to create an equation. Solving this equation will yield the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n1. Calculate total earnings for Thursday and for Friday.\n2. Substituting the known values into the equation, we get\n    total_Thursday - 40 = rate_car * number_car_Friday\n3. Solving this equation will yield number_car_Friday.\n4. Once number_car_Friday is obtained via Python, I will ask you to verify the result. If you validate the results, I will then present the final answer. If the results are not validated, I will revise my calculations.\n\nLet's begin with step 1. \n\n```python\n# declare rates perday for each tire type\nrate_truck = 60\nrate_car = 40\n\n# declare number of tires repaired on Thursday\nnumber_truck = 6\nnumber_car = 4\n\n# calculate earnings on Thursday\ntotal_Thursday = rate_truck * number_truck + rate_car * number_car\n\n# print the total amount earned on Thursday\nprint(total_Thursday)\n```"

We calculated that the total earning on Thursday, when the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, was $520.\n2. It's given that the mechanic earned $40 less on Friday, repairing only car tires, which amounts to $480.\n3. Given that the mechanic charges $40 to repair each car tire, we divided the total Friday earnings by the cost per car tire, yielding 12 tires.\n\nWith these steps, we have cross-verified the correctness of our answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the mechanic repaired \\boxed{12} car tires on Friday."
