Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

Calculate the number of days a single individual would need to paint the entire house based on the information that it takes half the time to paint half of the house.\n2. Convert these days into hours.\n3. Calculate the rate at which a single individual can paint by dividing the total task (1 whole house) by the total time taken. \n4. Calculate the rate at which a team of 5 individuals would paint the entire house by multiplying an individual's rate by 5.\n5. Use the rate of the team to find out how long it will take to paint the entire house (by dividing the total task by the team rate).\n\nWe can compute steps 1 to 5 in Python. Let me solve it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the number of  days a single individual would need to paint the entire house\nindividual_days = 2 * 5 # days\n\n# Step 2: Convert these days into hours\nindividual_hours = individual_days * 24 # hours\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the rate at which a single individual can paint\nindividual_rate = Rationals(1) / individual_hours # house per hour\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the rate at which a team of 5 individuals would paint the entire house\nteam_rate = 5 * individual_rate # house per hour\n\n# Step 5: Use the rate of the team to find out how long it will take to paint the entire house\nteam_hours = Rationals(1) / team_rate # hours\n\nteam_hours\n```\n"

This time was converted to 24*10 = 240 hours. \n2. The rate at which an individual can paint was computed as 1 house per 240 hours.\n3. We next calculated the painting rate for a team of 5 people, which was 5 times the individual's painting rate.\n4. Finally, we computed the time required for the 5-person team to paint a single house by taking the reciprocal of the team's painting rate.\n\nThe solution computation did not reveal any inconsistencies or errors, and all performed steps align with our initial problem-solving plan. Thus, I am confident in the solution's correctness and can conclude my verification.\n\nAccording to these calculations, for a team of 5 individuals, it will take 48 hours to paint an entire house. Therefore, the solution is boxed{48}."
