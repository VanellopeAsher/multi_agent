Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $150, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?"

Each person (Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna) will receive $140.00 after evenly distributing their combined funds. \n\nSo the final solution to the problem is: After pooling and evenly splitting their available money, each person will have $140. \n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Aurelia begins with $150.\n2. Kassidy has 2/3 of Aurelia's money, coming to $100.\n3. Rayna has $70 more than Kassidy, equalling $170.\n4. In total, the three together have $150 (Aurelia) + $100 (Kassidy) + $170 (Rayna) = $420.\n5. When they share the total sum equally, each gets $420 / 3 = $140. \n\nThis solidifies that the calculations and reasoning are correct, as the final answer matches the computed result.\n\nFinal Answer: After pooling their money and distributing it evenly among themselves, each person will have $140."
