Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another inches in the third week and the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inces tall. How many inches did the beanstalk grow in the third week?"

      "content": "Approach:\nThe problem can be solved step by step using Python for quick calculations. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Determine the height of the beanstalk after the first week. This information is given in the problem statement.\n2. Calculate the height of the beanstalk after the second week. According to the problem, the plant doubles its size in the second week.\n3. Once we have the height of the plant after the second week, we can subtract it from the total height after three weeks to determine the number of inches the beanstalk grew in the third week.\n\n```python\n# given\nweek1_height = 3 \nweek2_height = week1_height * 2\n\nfinal_height = 10 # height of beanstalk after 3 weeks\n\n# calculate the height grown in third week\nweek3_growth = final_height - week2_height\n\nprint(week3_growth)\n```"

In the second week, the plant doubles in size, making its total height 6 inches.\n3. The total height of the plant after three weeks is 10 inches. \n4. Subtracting the height after the second week from the total height after three weeks (10-6) gives us the growth in the third week.\n\nThe calculated growth for the third week matches our expectations, so the solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{4}."
