Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

      "content": "The problem requires us to determine the total number of action figures that Peter will end up with at the end of the week. To solve this problem, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate how much money Peter will spend each day.\n2. Find out how many wooden action figures Peter bought from Sunday to Wednesday\n3. Establish how many plastic action figures Peter will buy for the rest of the week\n4. Finally, add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of figures.\n\nHere are the Python calculations to execute these steps:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Total money Peter has\ntotal_money = 70\n\n# Days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Money spent each day\nmoney_per_day = total_money/days_in_week\n\n# Price of wooden action figures\nprice_wooden_figures = 5\n\n# Price of plastic action figures\nprice_plastic_figures = 2.5\n\n# How many wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday\ndays_sunday_wednesday = 4\nwooden_figures = sp.floor(money_per_day/price_wooden_figures) * days_sunday_wednesday\n\n# How many plastic action figures bought for the rest of the week\ndays_remaining = days_in_week - days_sunday_wednesday\nplastic_figures = sp.floor(money_per_day/price_plastic_figures) * days_remaining\n\n# Total action figures\ntotal_figures = wooden_figures + plastic_figures\n\nprint(total_figures)\n```\nOnce you input this code into your Python environment and execute, you will get the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. Remember to round down the number of action figures to the nearest whole number since we cannot have partial figures. "

Figured out how much money Peter spends each day. Given he has $70 for a week, he spends $10 each day.\n2. Calculated the number of wooden action figures he bought from Sunday to Wednesday. Wooden action figures cost $5 each, so he bought 2 each day for 4 days, which gives 8 wooden figures.\n3. Computed the number of plastic action figures he bought from Thursday to Saturday. Plastic figures cost $2.5 each, so he bought 4 each day for the remaining 3 days, which gives 12 plastic figures.\n4. Added the number of wooden and plastic action figures to get the total. This gives us 8 (from wooden figures) + 12 (from plastic figures), for a total of \\boxed{20} action figures.\n\nThere are no further calculations or steps in this problem."
