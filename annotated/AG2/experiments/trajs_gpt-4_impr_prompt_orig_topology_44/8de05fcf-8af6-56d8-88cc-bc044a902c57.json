Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "This problem is a multi-step word problem that involves operations with fractions and basic algebra. A possible solution plan can be:\n\n1. Compute the number of articles written on Tuesday, by multiplying the number of articles written on Monday by 2/5 and then adding this result to the number of articles written on Monday.\n2. Compute the total time spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday, by multiplying the number of articles by the hours it takes to write each (4).\n3. Subtract the hours spent writing on Monday and Tuesday from the total hours spent writing in the three days to find how many hours were spent writing on Wednesday.\n4. Compute the number of articles written on Wednesday by dividing the hours spent writing by the hours it takes to write each article.\n5. Compute the ratio of the number of articles written on Wednesday to the number of articles written on Tuesday.\n\nNow let's solve this using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# given values\narticles_Monday = 5 # number of articles written on Monday\narticles_Tuesday_factor = 2/5 # number of articles on Tuesday was 2/5 times more than on Monday\nhours_per_article = 4 # hours to write each article\ntotal_hours = 104 # total hours spent in threeday\n\n# compute number of articles written on Tuesday\narticles_Tuesday = articles_Monday + articles_Monday * articles_Tuesday_factor\n\n# compute total hours spent on Monday and Tuesday\nhours_Monday_Tuesday = (articles_Monday + articles_Tuesday) * hours_per_article\n\n# compute hours spent on Wednesday\nhours_Wednesday = total_hours - hours_Monday_Tuesday\n\n# compute articles written on Wednesday\narticles_Wednesday = hours_Wednesday / hours_per_article\n\n# compute the ratio of articles written on Wednesday to Tuesday\nratio_Wednesday_Tuesday = articles_Wednesday / articles_Tuesday\n\nprint(ratio_Wednesday_Tuesday)\n\n```\n\nYou can run this code to find the solution."

      "content": "Great, now let's verify our results.\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\nFirst, let's articulate the important points that we are assuming to be correct. \n\n1. Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. \n2. She wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. \n3. She spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over three days. \n4. It took an average of 4 hours to write each article.\n5. We have computed the ratio of the number of articles written on Wednesday to the number of articles written on Tuesday as 2.0.\n\nNow we break down the verification process into a few parts:\n\nPart 1: Verifying the number of hours Meredith spent on Monday and Tuesday:\nOn Monday, as per the problem, she wrote 5 articles, and each took 4 hours, so on Monday, she spent 20 hours. For Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than she did on Monday, which totals to 7 articles. Therefore, on Tuesday, she spent 7*4 = 28 hours. So, the total hours spent on both days is 48.\n\nPart 2: Verifying the number of hours Meredith spent on Wednesday:\nAccording to the problem, she spent a total of 104 hours writing in the three days, so on Wednesday, she must have spent 104 - 48 (the hours spent on Monday and Tuesday) = 56 hours writing.\n\nPart 3: Verifying the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday:\nIf each article takes 4 hours to write, and she spent 56 hours writing on Wednesday, she must have written 56 / 4 = 14 articles on Wednesday.\n\nPart 4: Verifying the ratio:\nNow, we can confirm our earlier calculation that the ratio of articles written on Wednesday to Tuesday, which is 14/7 = 2.0.\n\nGiven the successful verification, the final answer is that Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday, or \boxed{2} times."
