Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther\n\nWe can find the distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames where Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin using the following method:\n\n1. Compute the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone (which is three times further than without)\n2. Subtract the dragon's flame range from this computed distance, which gives the distance Polly could stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n```python\n# the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone\nbasic_throw_distance = 4000\n\n# the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone\ngemstone_throw_distance = 3 * basic_throw_distance\n\n# the distance of dragon's flame\ndragon_flame_distance = 10000\n\n# compute the distance outside the dragon's flame where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon\nsafe_distance = gemstone_throw_distance - dragon_flame_distance\n\nprint(safe_distance)\n```"

In this step, we take a moment to ensure the correctness and reasonability of our result.\n\nSo, is the calculated safe distance reasonable?\n\n- We know that the javelin can be thrown three times further when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, so the maximum throwing distance becomes 3Ã—4000 = 12,000 feet (which exactly matches our calculation in the problem-solving step).\n- The dragon's flames can reach up to 10,000 feet, so it makes sense that Polly could still hit the dragon from 2000 feet beyond the reach of the dragon's flames, because she can throw up to 12,000 feet.\n\nThus, we verify that the calculated safe distance is correct and reasonable.\n\nSo, the final answer should be the distance that Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\n\nThe final result is: \\boxed{2000} feet."
