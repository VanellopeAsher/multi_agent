Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.

      "content": "This problem can be tackled by solving some arithmetic equations.\n\nTo begin, we determine how many apples Joanne gathered from each type of tree: \n\n- From the tallest trees, Joanne gathered 30 apples. \n- From the shortest trees, she gathered half of this number, which equals 15 apples.\n- From the average trees, she gathered 350 apples. \n\nTherefore, the total number of apples that Joanne gathered can be computed as follows:\n\ntotal_apples_joanne = apples_tallest_trees + apples_shortest_trees + apples_average_trees\n\nJoanne's sister gathered different amounts from each type of tree:\n\n- From the tallest trees, she gathered twice as many as Joanne did, which equals 2 * 30 = 60 apples.\n- From the shortest trees, she gathered an unknown amount (let's denote this as Y apples). \n- From the average trees, she gathered none. \n\nThe sum of apples gathered by Joanne's sister can be computed as follows:\n\ntotal_apples_sister = apples_tallest_trees + apples_shortest_trees \n\nSince the total apples gathered by the sisters is 500, we can set up the following equation:\n\ntotal_apples_joanne + total_apples_sister = 500\n\nWe can then solve for Y, the number of apples gathered by the sister from the shortest trees. With Y in hand, we can calculate the ratio of the number of apples gathered by the sister compared to Joanne from the shortest trees, which is Y/15.\n\nPlease input the results obtained from the above computations to continue."
