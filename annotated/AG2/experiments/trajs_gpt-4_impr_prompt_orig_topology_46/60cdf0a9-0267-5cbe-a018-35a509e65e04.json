Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "This is a multi-step problem which involves first calculating the number of crayon muffins Kate made and then figuring out the price of each crayon muffin.\n\nThe key idea is to understand that Kate is making crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together, which means each crayon muffin requires 8 crayon pieces. \n\nAlso, Kate had 3 boxes of 64 crayons altogether, so we first need to figure out how many crayon pieces she had in total. \n\nAfter that, we can find out how many crayon muffins she was able to make. \n\nFinally, we divide the total money she made by the total number of crayon muffins to get the price of each muffin.\n\nThe python code below can be used to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# number of boxes is 3\nnumber_of_boxes = 3\n# each box has 64 crayons\nnumber_of_crayons_in_box = 64\n\n# Calculate total crayon pieces\ntotal_crayon_pieces = number_of_boxes * number_of_crayons_in_box\n# Kate uses 8 crayon pieces to make one crayon muffin\ncrayon_pieces_per_muffin = 8\n\n# Calculate total crayon muffins\ntotal_crayon_muffins = total_crayon_pieces / crayon_pieces_per_muffin\n\n# She made $36\ntotal_money_made = 36\n\n# Calculate the price of each crayon muffin\nprice_per_crayon_muffin = total_money_made / total_crayon_muffins\nprice_per_crayon_muffin\n```\n\nIf the results are as expected, we can confidently claim that the price we calculated is the price that each muffin crayon sells for."
