Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. The quilt is 101 square feet. If a small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric, a medium one is 4 square feet, and a large one is 6 square feet, and she used 8 medium and 6 large shirts, how many small shirts did she use to make the quilt?"

      "content": "The key idea here is to figure out first how much of the total quilt area the medium and large t-shirts take up. Once we have that, we subtract that from the total area of the quilt to find out how much area the small t-shirts are covering. To find out how many t-shirts she used, we will then divide this area by the area each small t-shirt covers.\n\nHere's the step by step process:\n\n1. Find the total area covered by medium and large t-shirts: multiply the number of each type of t-shirt by their respective sizes and add them.\n2. Subtract this area from the total area to get the area covered by small t-shirts.\n3. Calculate the number of small t-shirts by dividing this area by the size of a small t-shirt.\n\nNow let's use Python for step 1 and step 3. So, let's calculate the total area of medium and large shirts which is `area_medium_large = 8 * 4 + 6 * 6`.\n\n```python \n# your code here\narea_medium_large = 8 * 4 + 6 * 6\nprint(area_medium_large)\n```\n\nAfter we get the area covered by medium and large t-shirts, we subtract it from the total area of the quilt which is `area_small = 101 - area_medium_large`.\n\n```python\n# your code here\narea_small = 101 - area_medium_large\nprint(area_small)\n```\n\nFinally, we find out how many small t-shirts Octavia used, which can be calculated by `num_small = area_small / 3`.\n\n```python\n# your code here\nnum_small = area_small / 3\nprint(num_small)\n```"

      "content": "Given that the combined area occupied by the medium and large shirts is 68 square feet, we can subtract this from the total area of the quilt (101 square feet) as follows:\n\n`101 - 68 = 33 square feet`\n\nThis result is what we expected for the area to be covered by small t-shirts.\n\nNext, we divide that the area covered by small t-shirts (33 square feet) by the area of a single small t-shirt (3 square feet) to obtain the number of small shirts used:\n\n`33 / 3 = 11`\n\nThis is an exact number without remainder, which indicates that all of the used small shirts were fully included in the quilt, and the calculation is correct.\n\nLet's proceed with this solution.\n\nSo, the number of small t-shirts Octavia used to make the quilt is \\boxed{11}."
