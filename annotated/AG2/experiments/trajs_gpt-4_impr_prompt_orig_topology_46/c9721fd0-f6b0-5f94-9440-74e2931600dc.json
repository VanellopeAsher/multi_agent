Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThe total amount will be the sum of the service fee, labor cost and parts cost.\n\nThe labor cost is calculated by multiplying the labor time of 2.25 hours with the hourly rate of $35. Because the company charges for each hour or fraction of an hour, we will round the labor time up to the nearest integer before the multiplication. We will use the sympy package to implement the ceil function for rounding up.\n\nPython Solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# defining the variables\nservice_fee = 40\nhourly_rate = 35\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# hours of labor\nlabor_time = 2.25\n\n# labor cost, rounding up the labor time to the nearest hour\nlabor_cost = hourly_rate * ceiling(labor_time)\n\n# total bill\ntotal_amount = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\n\nprint(total_amount)\n```\nThe total_amount is the solution. So, let's run the code to find out."

Here, the time spent is 2.25 hours. As the company charges for any part of an hour as a full hour, this is rounded up to 3 hours. So, the labor cost will be $35 * 3 = $105.\n- The cost for parts used, which is $60.\n\nAdding these together, the total bill will be $40 (service fee) + $105 (labor cost) + $60 (parts cost) = $205.\n\nSo the final answer matches the one obtained from the code, and the solution is correct. Therefore, the total amount billed by Patty is  \boxed{205}."
