Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "1. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls went on the school trip. Since the prompt mentioned they were divided into equal groups, we can divide the total number of students (200) by 2.\n\n```python\ntotal_students = 200\nboys = girls = total_students // 2\nprint(boys)\n```\n2. Second, we know that every boy brought back 600 seashells. Hence, the total number of seashells collected by the boys is the number of boys times 600.\n\n```python\nseashells_per_boy = 600\ntotal_seashells_boys = boys * seashells_per_boy\nprint(total_seashells_boys)\n```\n3. Third, the prompt informs us that the girls found an equal number of seashells to the boys, plus four times the number of seashells found by the boys. This means that the total number of seashells collected by the girls is equal to the total number of seashells collected by the boys multiplied by 5.\n\n```python\ntotal_seashells_girls = 5 * total_seashells_boys\nprint(total_seashells_girls)\n```\n4. Finally, to find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we can divide the total number of seashells collected by the girls by the number of girls.\n\n```python\nseashells_per_girl = total_seashells_girls // girls\nprint(seashells_per_girl)\n```\nThe final answer is the number of seashells each girl collected."
