Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

Add up the total ages from 1 and 2.\n\nEach of these steps can be computed using Python. Let's proceed with them one by one.\n\nStep 1: Calculating the total age of the sisters. Since all of the sisters are the same age, we simply multiply the number of sisters by their age.\nStep 2: Calculating the total age of the brothers. We know the age of the younger brother and that the older brother is twice as old, so we add these two ages together.\nStep 3: Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers to get the total age of all siblings."

So, total age = 10*16 = 160\n- Brothers: 12-year-old and 24-year-old (since elder brother is twice the age of younger one). So, total age = 12 + 24 = 36\n - Therefore, total age of all siblings = 160 (sisters) + 36 (brothers) = 196\n\nThis matches with the output obtained from direct calculation which is 196. Hence, I am confident that the solution is correct.\n\nThe total age of all these siblings is \\boxed{196}."
