Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each. At the checkout, she got $3 off because she had voucher. The next day, the price increased to $25 per fruit, but the store also offered a 15% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 15 apples. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the apples on the two days?"

Calculate the total cost for Clara on Tuesday (15 apples * $15/apple - $3 voucher).\n2. Calculate the total cost for Sheila on Wednesday. The discount needs to be taken into account here (15 apples * $25/apple * (1-15%)).\n3. Subtract the amount paid on Tuesday from the amount paid on Wednesday to find the difference.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\n# Amount paid by Clara on Tuesday\napples_clara = 15\nprice_clara = 15\nvoucher_clara = 3\ntotal_clara = apples_clara * price_clara - voucher_clara\n\n\n# Amount paid by Sheila on Wednesday\napples_sheila = 15\nprice_sheila = 25\ndiscount_sheila = 15 / 100\ntotal_sheila = apples_sheila * price_sheila * (1 - discount_sheila)\n\n# Difference\ndifference = total_sheila - total_clara\nprint(difference)\n```"
