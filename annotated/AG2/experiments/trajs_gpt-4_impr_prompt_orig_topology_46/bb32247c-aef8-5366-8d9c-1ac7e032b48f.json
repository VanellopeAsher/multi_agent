Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was several inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?"

      "content": "The problem appears to be missing information on the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week. Without this information, we won't be able to provide the exact height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks. We can, however, calculate the height in terms of the initial height. Let's denote the initial height of the beanstalk as x (in inches). \n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process.\n\nLet's break the problem into steps:\n1. Week 1: Height is x inches.\n2. Week 2: Height doubles (2*x inches).\n3. Week 3: Height increases by 4 inches (2*x + 4 inches).\n\nSummarizing the above steps, we have the following expression for the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks:\n2 * x (height after the second week) + 4 (growth in the third week).\n\nThis step doesn't require calculation or programming. Now, we need to represent this equation in Python to display the final height. So, let's write the Python code.\n\n```python\ndef beanstalk_height(x):\n    height_after_week_2 = 2*x\n    height_after_week_3 = height_after_week_2 + 4\n    print(\"The height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, given initial height of x = \", x, \"inches is: \", height_after_week_3, \"inches\")\n\nbeanstalk_height(x)\n```\n\nThis Python code can be used to calculate the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, given the initial height x. It doubles the height for the second week and adds 4 inches for the third week. Note that x needs to be replaced by the actual height in inches after the first week, once this information is provided.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nAs we don't have the initial height, we should return None for the exact height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks:\n\n$\\boxed{None}$"

The height of the beanstalk after three weeks, however, can be expressed in terms of the initial height x as:\n\n`2*x + 4`\n\nThis implies that the beanstalk's height after three weeks is double the initial height plus an additional 4 inches.\n\nWithout knowing the initial height ('x'), we can only write our answer in terms of 'x':\n\nThe height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is `2*x + 4` inches.\n\nSince we're dealing with an unknown, our final answer is $\\boxed{None}$."
