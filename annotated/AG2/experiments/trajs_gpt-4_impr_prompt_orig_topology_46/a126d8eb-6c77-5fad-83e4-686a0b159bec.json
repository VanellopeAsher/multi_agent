Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJake is shopping at a clothing store. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Jake decides to buy 20 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $80.

      "content": "This problem requires us to calculate the total price Jake spends on T-shirts and shoes.\n\nFirstly, we need to calculate the total price for the T-shirts. Since the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts, the price for each pair of T-shirts (2 T-shirts) would be 1.5 times the price of a single shirt. As Jake buys 20 T-shirts, the total price for the T-shirts is 10 (total pairs) times the price of each pair.\n\nSecondly, we need to calculate the discounted price for the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price, so the price Jake pays for the shoes is 60% of the original price.\n\nFinally, we add these two amounts together to find the total amount Jake spends at the store.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step."
