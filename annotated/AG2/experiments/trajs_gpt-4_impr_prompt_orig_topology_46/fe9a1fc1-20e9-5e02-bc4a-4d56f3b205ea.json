Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKatarina has 5 less cookies than Max has.

Together, they have a total of 298 cookies.\n\nStep 5: Verify the result.\nWe can easily verify our solution using simple reasoning. The problem stated that Max has 1.2 times 10 more cookies than Cookie Monster, Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. It is also stated that Katarina has 68 cookies. \n\nBased on the provided relationships and our calculations, Max's number of cookies (73 cookies) does indeed correspond to 1.2 times 10 more cookies than Cookie Monster's (which equates to 73 - 12 = 61 cookies). Similarly, Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, (which is indeed 68 cookies), and Summer has 23 more cookies than Max (which is indeed 96 cookies). So, all of the individual counts check out.\n\nThe total count can then be verified by summing the individual counts: 61 + 73 + 68 + 96 = 298 cookies.\n\nSince our calculated numbers match the verification, we conclude that the solution is correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is that they have a total of 298 cookies. \n\nLet me present the final result: \n\nSo they have a total of \boxed{298} cookies."
