Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is to set up a system of equations. Letâ€™s denote:\n\nT = number of packets of tomato seeds\n\nC = number of packets of celery seeds\n\nFrom the problem prompt we know that:\n1. `C = 80` packets of celery\n2. The total cost is $3200. So, the equation for the total cost will be `40T + 30C = 3200`\n \nWe can substitute `C = 80` into the second equation and solve for `T` using sympy. Let's move to the Python solution.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define symbols\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# define equations\nequation = Eq(40*T + 30*80, 3200)\n\n# solve equations\nT_value = solve(equation, T)\n\nprint(\"The number of packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought is \", T_value[0])\n```"

The total cost: `40T + 30C = 3200` \n2. The known quantity of celery packets:    `C = 80`\n\nBy substituting `T = 20` and `C = 80` into the total cost equation, we get:\n\nVerify1: `40*T + 30*C = 3200` == `40*20 + 30*80 = 3200` == `800 + 2400 = 3200` == `3200 = 3200` which is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer has been verified and is correct.\n\nFinally, the number of packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought is \boxed{20}."
