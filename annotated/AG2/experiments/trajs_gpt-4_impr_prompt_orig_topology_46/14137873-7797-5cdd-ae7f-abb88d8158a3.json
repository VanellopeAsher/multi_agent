      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDave purchased a big packet of french fries and consumed fourteen before a ravenous seagull snatched the packet from his grasp.

Later, a raccoon pilfered two thirds of the remaining fries. A single french fry was then carried away by ants, leaving only five behind.

Each of the three pigeons ate three fries.\n4. The raccoon took away two thirds of the remaining fries.\n5. Ants took one single fry, and five fries are left.\n\nTo find: The initial quantity of fries in the packet.\n\nWe can use algebra to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, denote the number of fries originally in the packet as x. \nThe number of fries eaten by the seagull is 14/2 = 7 fries.\nEach pigeon eats 3 fries, so three pigeons eat 3 * 3 = 9 fries.\n\nSo far, x - 14 - 7 - 9 fries remain. \n\nThe raccoon then eats two thirds of the remaining fries, so there are (1 - 2/3) * (x - 14 - 7 - 9) fries left.\n\nFinally, the ants take one fry, and there are 5 fries remaining. Thus, we have the following equation: \n(1 - 2/3) * (x - 14 - 7 - 9) - 1 = 5\n\nLet's solve this equation to find x, the initial quantity of fries.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\neq = Eq((1 - 2/3) * (x - 14 - 7 - 9) - 1, 5)\ninitial_fries = solve(eq, x)[0]\nprint(initial_fries)\n```"
