Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

Calculating the ages of the sisters.\n2. Calculating the ages of the brothers.\n3. Adding all the ages together.\n\nAll of these steps can be performed directly in Python. Let's write the code to solve this. \n\n```python\n# Age of each sister is 1.6 times of ten, so each sister's age is\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10 \n\n# The total age of all three sisters is\ntotal_sister_age = 3 * sister_age\n\n# Age of younger brother is 3/5 of 20 years old, so his age is\nyounger_brother_age = (3/5) * 20 \n\n# This age is half the age of the older brother, so the older brother's age is\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# The total age of all siblings is\ntotal_age = total_sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nPerform the calculation.\n\nVerification Steps:\n1. Check all the arithmetic computations.\n2. Confirm that the correct values are being used in the correct places.\n3. Make sure the final result makes sense and fits the description given in the problem."
