Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.50 apiece, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4.50 apiece and 13 blueberry muffins that were $1.50 apiece.

      "content": "Great! This means that, after applying the 10% discount from the loyalty card, Marcus' total bill comes to $54.45.\n\nIn the VERIFICATION section:\n1. Deep breath taken to ensure a clear mind.\n2. Step-by-step the calculation has been verified:\n    - Total Cost for croissants: 5 pieces * $3.50/piece = $17.50\n    - Total Cost for cinnamon rolls: 4 pieces * $2.50/piece = $10.00\n    - Total Cost for mini quiches: 3 pieces * $4.50/piece = $13.50\n    - Total Cost for blueberry muffins: 13 pieces * $1.50/piece = $19.50\n    - Sum of the above gives the total cost before discount: $17.50 + $10.00 + $13.50 + $19.50 = $60.50\n    - The 10% discount of $60.50 is $60.50 * 10% = $6.05\n    - Subtracting the discount from the total cost results in the final cost: $60.50 - $6.05 = $54.45\n3. I'm confident in this verification, each step in the calculation has been double-checked.\n\nSo, Marcus' total bill is $54.45. \n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{54.45}$."
