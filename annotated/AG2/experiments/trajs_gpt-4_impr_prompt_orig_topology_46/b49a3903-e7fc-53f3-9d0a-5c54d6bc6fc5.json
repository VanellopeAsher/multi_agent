Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

This is because there will always be one less row of yellow tulips separating the rows of other colors. For example, 3 rows of red tulips will need 2 rows of yellow tulips to separate them. \n\nLet's run this code to solve the problem."

      "content": "VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the results step by step:\n\n- Jackson can plant 36/6 = 6 rows of red tulips.\n- He can plant 24/8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n- He will plant one less row of yellow tulips than there are rows of red and blue tulips, so 5 + 2 = 7 rows of yellow tulips.\n    (Note: An extra row of yellow tulips was added because there are more red rows than blue rows. The problem states \"a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips\", so we need an extra yellow row)\n- Adding these, we get 6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 7 (yellow) = 16 rows of flowers.\n  \nIt seems there's a mistake. The expected number of total rows is not matching with the previously computed result which is 22.\n\nLet's revise the previous calculations. \n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding in counting the number of yellow rows. We calculated yellow rows by decrementing the number of red and blue rows, whereas we should consider the total number of red and blue rows because between every red and blue row, there is a yellow row.\n\nRevised steps would be like this: \n\n- Compute rows for each kind of tulip i.e., Red, Blue, and Yellow.\n- Compute additional number of yellow tulip rows which will be one less than the sum of red and blue rows (since yellow rows are used to separate red and blue rows).\n- Sum all the rows.\n\nLet's revise the previously done calculation: \n\n```python\n# Calculate number of red, blue and yellow rows\nrows_red = red_tulips // per_row_red\nrows_blue = blue_tulips // per_row_blue\nrows_yellow = yellow_tulips // per_row_yellow\n\n# Calculate additional number of yellow rows\nadditional_yellow_rows = (rows_red + rows_blue) - 1\n\n# Total number of rows\ntotal_rows = rows_red + rows_blue + rows_yellow + additional_yellow_rows\ntotal_rows\n```\n\nWe can proceed with the above calculation now."

      "content": "Great! The revised calculation is successful. \n\nFinal Verification:\n\n- Jackson can plant 36/6 = 6 rows of red tulips.\n- He can plant 24/8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n- He can plant 30/5 = 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n  \n- There are total of 6 + 3 = 9 rows of red and blue tulips. Therefore, we should have 8 yellow rows separating these (since yellow tulips are planted between every row of red and blue tulips). This means 2 additional rows for yellow tulips will be required, and they can be planted since Jackson has a sufficient number of yellow tulips.\n\n- So, adding these, we get 6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 6 (yellow) + 2 (additional yellow) = 17 rows of flowers.\n  \nThere seems to be an issue with the result, it should be 17 but the calculation provided 23. \n\nSo, let me revise the steps again and fix the issue:\n\n- Compute rows for each kind of tulip i.e., Red, Blue, and Yellow.\n- Compute additional number of yellow tulip rows which will be equal to the sum of red and blue rows (since yellow rows are used to separate red and blue rows).\n- Subtract the base yellow rows (calculated in step 1) from the total new yellow rows (calculated in step 2) because the first calculation of yellow rows is included in the new calculation.\n- Sum all the rows.\n\n```python\n# Calculate number of red, blue and yellow rows\nrows_red = red_tulips // per_row_red\nrows_blue = blue_tulips // per_row_blue\nrows_yellow = yellow_tulips // per_row_yellow\n\n# Calculate additional number of yellow rows\nadditional_yellow_rows = rows_red + rows_blue\n\n# Subtract the base yellow rows from total new yellow rows\nadditional_yellow_rows = additional_yellow_rows - rows_yellow\n\n# Total number of rows\ntotal_rows = rows_red + rows_blue + rows_yellow + additional_yellow_rows\ntotal_rows\n```\n\nThis new calculation looks correct now.
