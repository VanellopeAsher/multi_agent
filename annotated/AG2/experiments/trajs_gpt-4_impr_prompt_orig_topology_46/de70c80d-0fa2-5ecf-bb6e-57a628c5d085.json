Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full three times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?"

She writes the complete alphabet three times: `3 * 26`.\n2. She writes half of the alphabet once: `0.5 * 26`.\n3. The number of letters already written is the sum of the two above. \n4. She re-writes everything she has already written once, which gets added to the total already written: `2 * (results from steps 1 to 3)`.\n5. The final answer would be sum of all the letters she has written.\n \nLet's compute this in Python."

To clarify, I am capable of solving the equation myself, albeit in a simpler manner, without resorting to a programming language. \n\nLet's calculate it: \n\n1. Number of letters when she writes the complete alphabet three times: 3 * 26 = 78 letters.\n2. Number of letters when she writes half of the alphabet once: 0.5 * 26 = 13 letters.\n3. The total letters already written is 78 (from step 1) + 13 (from step 2) = 91 letters.\n4. She re-writes everything she has already written once more, so the overall total is twice the total already written, which is: 2 * 91 = 182 letters.\n\nBased on these calculations, Elise has written a total of \\boxed{182} letters. \n\nPlease verify the answer on your end as well to confirm."
