Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.

How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?"

      "content": "# Reasoning\n\nGiven the problem, we know that:\n- Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards.\n- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards.\n- The number of cards a box contains isn't specified (Let's call it x cards per box).\n- Erica passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.\n- She received 17 from her family and friends.\n\nThe overall total will be the number of cards Erica had (the ones she made and the ones from the boxes), plus the ones she received, minus the ones she passed out. Assuming x cards in each box, the expression is: 20 + 2 * x (her cards) - 29 (passed out cards) + 17 (received cards).\n\n# Python Solution\n\nLet's implement this logic into the python solution.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# initialize the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# cards Erica made\nerica_cards = 20\n\n# cards from boxes\nboxes_cards = 2 * x\n\n# cards given out\npassed_out = 29\n\n# cards received\nreceived = 17\n\n# total cards left expression\ntotal_cards = Eq(erica_cards + boxes_cards - passed_out + received, 0)\n\n# solve for x\nsolution = solve(total_cards)\nprint('Number of cards in each box:', solution)\n```\n\nUnfortunately, since the problem did not give the exact number of cards in each box, we only have an equation with an unknown variable (x - number of cards in each box). Hence, without further information, we cannot determine the exact number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has got now.\n\nIf the number of cards in each box is provided, we can modify the problem-solving approach to get the number of cards Erica has."
