Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

This would be double of the money determined in step 2.\n    \nStep 4: Subtract from this total amount the $120 ($20*6) Ali got from the 6 twenty-dollar bills. \n  \nWe can then write a python program to calculate the above steps."

Therefore, we may have made a mistake during our calculation. Let's review and correct it.\n\nI think the mistake was in Step 2. Here, instead of multiplying by (5/3) to get the amount before dinner, I should have multiplied by (5/2) because if 3/5 of the amount after giving to his sister was spent at dinner, then 2/3 of the amount was left after dinner. With these corrections, the steps should be:\n\n1. Multiply the remaining money after dinner ($32) by 2 to find how much he had after giving money to his sister ($64).\n\n2. Multiply this amount by (5/2) to find how much he had before dinner, since 2/3 of this amount is what was left after dinner ($160).\n\n3. Multiply this amount by 2 to find the original amount of money Ali had, since he gave half to his sister ($320).\n\n4. Subtract the amount from the six $20 bills from this total to find how much is left in $10 bills ($320 - $120 = $200).\n\n5. Divide this amount by $10 to find how many $10 bills there are.\n\nLet's redo the calculation following these steps.\n\n```python\n# Corrected step 2\nbefore_dinner = simplify(after_sister * (5/2))\n\n# The original total money Ali had\noriginal_total = 2 * before_dinner\n\n# The money from the ten dollar bills\nten_bills = original_total - twenty_bills\n\n# The number of ten dollar bills Ali had originally\nnum_ten_bills = ten_bills / 10\n\nnum_ten_bills\n```"
