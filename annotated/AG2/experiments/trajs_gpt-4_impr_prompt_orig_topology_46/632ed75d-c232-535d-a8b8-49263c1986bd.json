      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?"

      "content": "Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first aircraft each day as 'A'. According to the problem, three-fourths of 'A' are going to Greece, and the rest of the flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. This is represented as (1-3/4)A / 2 = A/8. \n\nThe problem also states that the second aircraft makes half as many flights as the first one (i.e., A/2), and it makes 44 flights altogether. We have a simple equation: A/2 = 44.\n\nWe can begin by solving this equation to find 'A', and then use it to calculate the number of flights going to France each day.\n\nLet's start coding it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variable\nA = symbols('A')\n\n# equation according to the problem\nequation = Eq(A / 2, 44)\n\n# solve the equation for 'A'\ntotal_flights_1 = solve(equation, A)[0]\n\n# compute the number of flights to France\nflights_to_france = total_flights_1 / 8\n\n# print the result\nprint(flights_to_france)\n```"

      "content": "Great! It appears that the first aircraft makes 11 flights to France each day.\n\nTo confirm, let's use the results to verify the initial parameters of the problem.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. We found that the first aircraft makes a total of 88 flights each day as per our calculation (2*44).\n2. Out of these, three-fourths, or 66 flights, are going to Greece.\n3. That leaves us with 22 flights (88-66), which are evenly distributed between France and Germany.\n4. Dividing these 22 flights equally, we get 11 flights each for France and Germany.\n\nThis aligns with our original findings and validates the problem's statement, as the second aircraft indeed makes half as many flights as the first.\n\nThe final answer is 11. \n\nI can now confidently say that the number of flights made by the first aircraft to France each day is \\boxed{11}."
