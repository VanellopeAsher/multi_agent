Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 100 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: Let's use the direct python solution for this.\n\nKey Concept: We can solve this problem by calculating the total time John runs in a week and then dividing the total distance he runs by the total time.\n\nHere's how to approach it step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the total running time in a week. We have information that John runs 10 hours for the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the total running time would be 10 hours plus 2 days of half time (which would be 5 hours each day).\n\n2. Next, we divide the total distance (100 miles) by the total running time to get the speed at which John runs. \n\n3. This will give us the answer in miles per hour.\n\nLet's get started with the calculations.\n```python\n# first day run\nday1_run_time = 10  # hours\n\n# the other two days he runs half as much as the first day\nday2_and_day3_run_time = day1_run_time / 2 * 2  # hours\n\n# so total run is\ntotal_run_time = day1_run_time + day2_and_day3_run_time # hours\n\n# now, we compute speed\nspeed_in_mph = 100 / total_run_time  # miles per hour\n\nspeed_in_mph\n```\nAfter running the above program, you will obtain the speed at which John runs in miles per hour."

Calculate the speed:\n    - Distance = 100 miles\n    - Time = 20 hours\n    - Speed = Distance / Time = 100 miles / 20 hours = 5.0 miles per hour\n\nFrom the above verification steps, it appears that the calculations have been done correctly.\n\nSo, the speed at which John runs is \boxed{5.0} miles per hour."
