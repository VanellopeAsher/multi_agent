Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?"

      "content": "The problem will be divided into the following steps: \n1. Set the variables for the cost of a jacket, shoes, money earned from babysitting and mowing, and Sara's savings. \n2. Compute the total cost of the jacket and shoes, and the total money earned from babysitting. \n3. Determine the remaining amount needed for the purchase, and compute the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to reach this amount.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\n# Set the variables\ncost_of_jacket = 120\ncost_of_shoes = 100 * 2\nbabysitting_fee = 5 * 10\nmowing_fee = 10\nsavings = 100\n\n# Compute the total cost of the jacket and shoes, and the total money earned from babysitting.\ntotal_cost = cost_of_jacket + cost_of_shoes\n\ntotal_earned = babysitting_fee + savings\n\n# Determine the remaining amount needed for the purchase\nremaining = total_cost - total_earned\n\n# compute the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn this amount\nnum_of_mowing = remaining / mowing_fee\n\nprint(num_of_mowing)\n```\n\nWe expect num_of_mowing to be the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn. However, since she can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, if num_of_mowing is not an integer, then Sara needs to mow the lawn one more time. Let's address this in the next steps."

We know that the cost of the jacket and two pairs of shoes is $320 as $(120 + 2*100) = 320$.\n2. Sara's income from babysitting is $50 as $5*10 = 50$.\n3. Adding Sara's savings of $100 to her babysitting income totals $150.\n4. Sara needs to earn another $170 to afford the jacket and shoes. As $(320 - 150) = 170$.\n5. Sara earns $10 each time she mows the lawn, so to earn $170, she needs to mow the lawn 17 times. As $170/10 = 17$.\n\nTherefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 17 times before she can afford to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes."
