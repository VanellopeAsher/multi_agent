Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStudents in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior.

That's correct. \n\nSo, to conclude: The class is missing 210 points to reach the minimum threshold of 500 points.\n\nBefore we finalize the answer, let's verify:\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Given, Alex has 60 points.\n2. Bella has 30% more points than Alex. Calculate it as: \n   60 + 30% of 60 = 60 + 18 = 78 points.\n3. It is given that Tim has 40 points less than Bella. \n   So, Tim = 78 - 40 = 38 points.\n4. Again, it's given that Mary has three times the points of Tim.\n   Which makes Mary = 3 * 38 = 114 points.\n5. Therefore, total points = Alex + Bella + Tim + Mary = 60 + 78 + 38 + 114 = 290 points.\n6. As the total minimum amount of points needed is 500, the number of points the class is missing = 500 - 290 = 210 points.\n\nThus, the class is missing 210 points to satisfy the minimum points threshold for the field trip. This matches our original calculation.\n\nThe final result is: \boxed{210}."
