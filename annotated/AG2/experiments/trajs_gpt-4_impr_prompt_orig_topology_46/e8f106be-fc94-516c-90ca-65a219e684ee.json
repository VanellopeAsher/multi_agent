Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is planning a birthday party and wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.

      "content": "This problem can be approached by finding the total perimeter of the rectangle. Since streamers are to be hung all around the rectangular fence except the tree, we can leave the height of the tree out of our calculation.\n\nThe total length of crepe paper required would be equal to the perimeter of the rectangular fence, which is given by the formula 2 * (length + breadth) for a rectangle.\n\nWe can directly translate this into a Python code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef crepe_paper_length(length, breadth):\n    return 2 * (length + breadth)\n\ncrepe_length = crepe_paper_length(20, 15)\nprint(crepe_length)\n```\n\nExecute the above Python code to find the total length of crepe paper that James needs to buy for his fence."

For the rectangle in this scenario, where the length is 20 feet and the breadth is 15 feet, the calculation becomes 2 * (20 + 15), which indeed outputs 70 as we got.\n\nSo, here is my final answer:\n\nJames needs to buy - \\boxed{70} feet of crepe paper for his fence."
