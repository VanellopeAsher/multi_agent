Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now."

It won't require advanced Python coding but will involve standard mathematical operation which can be done directly with Python.\nThe problem will be addressed by using a Direct Python Solution (Case 1).\n\nFirst, we have their present ages ratio as 7 : 11 and their combined age is 162. From this information, we can calculate each of their present ages.\nThen we will find out Allen's age after 10 years from the present.\n\nLet's start to solve this problem by writing the Python code.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy library for symbolic calculations\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define variable x for our calculation\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x\n# From the problem, we know that the sum of their ages is 162\nage_eq = Eq(7*x + 11*x, 162)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsoln = solve(age_eq, x)\n\n# Since x is the ratio, Allen's current age is 11 times the ratio\nallens_age_now = soln[0]*11\n\n# Allen's age in 10 years\nallens_age_in_10_years = allens_age_now + 10\n\n# Finally, print Allen's age in 10 years\nprint(\"Allen's age in 10 years will be: \", allens_age_in_10_years)\n```\n\nPlease run this code in your local Python environment and provide the output."
