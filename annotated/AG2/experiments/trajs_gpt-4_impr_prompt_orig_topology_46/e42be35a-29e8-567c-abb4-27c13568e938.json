Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

Compute the total number of brownies Greta initially had, taking into account the brownies she made, the brownies she received from her office, and the ones her friends had waiting for her.\n2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party from the total number of brownies to find out how many she had left at the end of the day.\n\nNow, let's compute these values and obtain the result. \n\n```python\n# Total number of brownies she made for her herself\nmade = 1 * 12  # 1 dozen is 12\n\n# Total number of brownies she received from her office\noffice = 1/2 * 12  # 1/2 dozen\n\n# Total number of brownies her friends had ready for the party\nfriends = 4 * 12  # 4 dozen\n\n# Calculate the initial total amount of brownies\ninitial = made + office + friends\n\n# Calculate the amount of brownies eaten at the party\neaten = 1.5 * 12  # 1.5 dozen\n\n# Calculate the leftover amount of brownies\nleft = initial - eaten\n\nleft\n```"

The final answer is \\boxed{48}."
