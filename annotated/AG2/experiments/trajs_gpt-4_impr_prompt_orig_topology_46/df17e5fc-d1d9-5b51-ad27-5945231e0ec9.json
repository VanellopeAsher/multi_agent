Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it. They are red, white, purple, and yellow.   Half the mural is yellow. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, calculate how many pints of red paint was used."

      "content": "1. Problem Analysis:\n\n    We know that half the mural is yellow. This means that the other half is made up of red, white, and purple paint in equal amounts.\n\n2. Python Calculation:\n\n    The total amount of paint used was 12 pints. The yellow paint used is half of this, which is 6 pints (12/2).\n\n    The remaining paint (12 - 6 = 6 pints) is equally divided among red, white and purple. Hence, the amount of red paint used will be 6/3 = 2 pints.\n    \nWe'll use Python to perform these calculations. \n\n```python\ntotal_paint = 12\nyellow_paint = total_paint / 2\nother_paints = total_paint - yellow_paint\n\nred_paint = other_paints / 3\nprint(red_paint)\n```"

Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step:\n\n   - Half the mural is yellow, and the other half has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.\n   - We have total 12 pints of paint.\n   - So, half of 12, that is 6 pints, is yellow.\n   - The remaining 6 pints of paint are divided evenly among red, white, and purple paints.\n   - Therefore, each of these colors will have used 2 pints of paint (6 pints / 3 colors).\n\nGiven that all these checks have passed, the final answer to the problem - the number of pints of red paint used in the mural- is 2. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2}."
