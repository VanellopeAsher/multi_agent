Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "This problem is a math word problem that deals with proportions and multiplications. It's a combination of quantities and ratio problems. A step-by-step approach will be the most appropriate way to address this problem:\n1. Compute the total number of articles written on Tuesday, given it's 2/5 times more than on Monday.\n2. Calculate the total hours spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday.\n3. Subtract this total from the overall hours spent on three days (104 hours) to get the hours spent on Wednesday.\n4. Find the number of articles written on Wednesday by dividing the hours spent on that day by 4, the amount of time it takes to write an article.\n5. Compare the number of articles written on Wednesday and Tuesday to get the final answer.\n\nLet's start solving this problem by following the above steps. \n\nStep 1: Find the total number of articles written on Tuesday:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday\nmonday_articles = 5\n\n# Calculate Tuesday articles which is 2/5 times more than Monday's articles\ntuesday_articles = monday_articles + 2/5 * monday_articles\nprint(tuesday_articles)\n```\n\nStep 2 and 3: Calculate the total hours spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday and subtract this total from the overall hours spent on three days:\n\n```python\n# Average hours spent per article\nhours_per_article = 4\n\n# Total writing hours for Monday and Tuesday\nmon_tue_hours = (monday_articles + tuesday_articles) * hours_per_article\n\n# Total hours Meredith spent writing articles last week\ntotal_hours = 104\n\n# Hours spent on Wednesday\nwednesday_hours = total_hours - mon_tue_hours\nprint(wednesday_hours)\n```\n\nStep 4: Find the number of articles written on Wednesday:\n\n```python\n# Number of articles written on Wednesday\nwednesday_articles = wednesday_hours / hours_per_article\nprint(wednesday_articles)\n```\n\nStep 5: Compare the number of articles written on Wednesday and Tuesday:\n\n```python\n# Times of the number of articles written on Wednesday compared to Tuesday\ntimes = wednesday_articles / tuesday_articles\nprint(times)\n```\n\nLet's direct our attention to these Python codes or alternatively, we can proceed to enumerate the problem if that's what you prefer."

Here is the summary of what has been solved:\n\nStep 1: Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles.\nStep 2 & 3: She spent 56 hours writing articles on Monday and Tuesday, which means she spent 48 hours writing articles on Wednesday.\nStep 4: On Wednesday, she wrote 14 articles.\nStep 5: On Wednesday, she wrote two times more articles than she did on Tuesday.\n\nVerification steps:\n\n1. The results of each step are consistent with the problem statement.\n2. We know that every article takes 4 hours to write, so we can verify our results by multiplying the number of articles by 4 for each day, summing them, and comparing the result to the total hours worked (104 hours).\n\n```python\nmonday_hours = monday_articles * 4\nverified_tuesday_hours = tuesday_articles * 4\nverified_wednesday_hours = wednesday_articles * 4\n\nif monday_hours + verified_tuesday_hours + verified_wednesday_hours == total_hours:\n    print(\"Verified\")\n```\n3.
