Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?"

Since Mr. Yu gets 1/3 of the messages Ms. Thompson gets, we can directly calculate the number of messages Mr. Yu gets from the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson.\n\n```python\nthompson_messages = 84\nyu_messages = thompson_messages / 3\n\ntotal_messages = thompson_messages + yu_messages\nprint(total_messages)\n```"

However, the answer should be an integer as it's practically impossible to deliver a fraction of a message.\n\nI suggest we modify the calculation and round down the division result of the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu to the nearest integer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nthompson_messages = 84\nyu_messages = math.floor(thompson_messages / 3)\n\ntotal_messages = thompson_messages + yu_messages\nprint(total_messages)\n```"

      "content": "VERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify the answer step by step:\n\n1. The total number of messages delivered by James is made up of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.\n2. The problem statement mentions that Mr. Yu receives 1/3 the number of messages that Ms. Thompson receives. Hence, Mr. Yu would receive 1/3 of 84 messages, which results in 28 messages. Note that we're rounding down to the nearest whole number as Mr. Yu can't receive a fraction of a message.\n3. Adding the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson (84 messages) with those to Mr. Yu (28 messages) gives us a total of 112 messages.\n4. Checking with the result derived from the previous Python script, we see 112 messages which matches with our manual calculation. \n\nHence, I can confirm that the final answer is correct.\n\nSo, James delivers a total of $boxed{112}$ messages."
