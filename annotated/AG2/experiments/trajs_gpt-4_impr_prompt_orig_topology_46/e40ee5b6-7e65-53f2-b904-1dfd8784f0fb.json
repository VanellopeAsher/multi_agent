Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon. Given that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5, can you determine the total sum of money she expended on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon?"

First, we know the price of a one-gallon jar of milk is $5.\n\nAccording to the problem, a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon. \n\nLet's denote the price of a half-gallon jar as x. \n\nWe can write down this information as a simple equation:\n\n5 = x + 2\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the price of the half-gallon jar. \n\nOnce we know the prices of both types of jars, we can multiply them by the number of jars purchased to find the total amount Cecelia spent.\n\nLet's solve this step by step. \n\nStep 1: Find the price of half a gallon of milk. \nStep 2: Find the total price for 10 one-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.\nStep 3: Add these two totals to find the answer to our problem."

So, the total sum of money Cecelia expended on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon is \\$98.\n\nWe can verify this result in the following way:\n\nVerification Steps:\nStep 1: We calculated that the price of a half-gallon jar is $3, which makes sense because we know a one-gallon jar is $2 more expensive, and its price is $5.\nStep 2: We then used these prices to calculate the total price for 10 one-gallon jars ($5*10) and 16 half-gallon jars ($3*16).\nStep 3: We added these two amounts together, where \\$50 (from the one-gallon jars) + \\$48 (from the half-gallon jars) = \\$98.\n\nThis calculation makes sense and follows the problem's parameters, so I'm confident in the answer.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{98}"
