We can solve this problem by using a step-by-step process. \n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total time spent on boating and swimming.\nJohn spends 6.6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spends 6.6 + (6.6 / 2) = 9.9 hours on boating and swimming.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total time spent on watching shows.\nHe watched 3 shows which were 2.5 hours each, so he spent 3 * 2.5 = 7.5 hours on shows.\n\nStep 3: Find out the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows.\nIn this step, we sum up all the times spent on various activities, found in steps 1 and 2.\n\nStep 4: Given that the above total is 30% of his time, we compute the total time he spent, by taking the reciprocal of 0.3 and multiplying it by the time computed in step 3.\n\nStep 5: Finally, we find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is stated to be 40% of his total time. We compute this by multiplying the total time (obtained in step 4) by 0.4.\n\nNow, let's implement these steps in Python to get the answer."
