Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark took a test yesterday that consisted of 7.5 sets of ten questions.

      "content": "This problem involves simple arithmetic calculations.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine how many sets Mark finished in the allotted time for both tests. Mark's rate is 0.5 sets of ten questions per hour. Therefore, if he had 0.8 sets of ten hours for the first test, he finished 0.8 * 0.5 sets of ten questions. For the second test, given he had 0.6 sets of ten hours, he likewise finished 0.6 * 0.5 sets of ten questions.\n\nAfter finding the number of completed sets for both tests, we need to calculate how many sets Mark left incomplete. This can be accomplished by subtracting the number of sets Mark completed from the total number of sets.\n\nLet's proceed with the step-by-step process:\n\n- Calculation Step 1: Finish the calculation to find out how many sets Mark completed from the first test.\n- Calculation Step 2: Finish the calculation to find out how many sets Mark completed from the second test.\n- Calculation Step 3: Subtract the total completed sets from the total sets for both tests to find how many sets of ten questions Mark has left incomplete."
