He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?"

      "content": "The problem can be solved by using simple arithmetic.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n1. Elliott walked half of his 10,000-step goal to and from school, so half of 10,000 steps is:\n    half_steps = 10,000 / 2\n\n2. He took another walk with a friend, which added 1,000 steps:\n    friend_walk = 1,000 steps\n\n3. Elliott's shopping trip added another 500 steps:\n    shopping = 500 steps\n\n4. After taking a short jog, he realized he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means he had already walked:\n    already_walked = 10,000 - 2,000\n\n5. The steps that Elliott jogged can be calculated by subtracting all the steps he took that are listed in the problem from the total amount of steps he already walked prior to his last 2,000 steps.\n\nNow we can write a Python program to compute this.\n\n```python\n# Steps walked by Elliott to and from school\nhalf_steps = 10000 / 2\n\n# Steps walked by Elliott with his friend\nfriend_walk = 1000\n\n# Steps walked by Elliott during shopping\nshopping = 500\n\n# Steps already walked by Elliott after his jog\nalready_walked = 10000 - 2000\n\n# Steps jogged by Elliott\njog = already_walked - (half_steps + friend_walk + shopping)\n\nprint(jog)\n```"
