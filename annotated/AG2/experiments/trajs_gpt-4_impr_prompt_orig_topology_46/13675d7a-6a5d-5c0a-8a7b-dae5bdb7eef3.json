Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

For the cars, he needs 4 wheels per car, and for the motorcycles, he needs 2 wheels per motorcycle. Once we have this number, we can add the remaining wheels to get the total number of wheels that were originally in the box.\n\nLet's proceed with the Python code to solve this problem, implementing the calculation as described. \n\n```python\n# Number of cars and motorcycles\ncars = 57\nmotorcycles = 73\n\n# Wheels per car and motorcycle\nwheels_per_car = 4\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\n\n# Wheels left in the box\nremaining_wheels = 276\n\n# Calculate the total wheels used for the assembly of cars and motorcycles\nwheels_used_cars = cars * wheels_per_car\nwheels_used_motorcycles = motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle\n\n# Calculate the total wheels originally in the box\ntotal_wheels = wheels_used_cars + wheels_used_motorcycles + remaining_wheels\n\nprint(total_wheels)\n```\n\nThe result of this code will display the total number of wheels originally in the box."
