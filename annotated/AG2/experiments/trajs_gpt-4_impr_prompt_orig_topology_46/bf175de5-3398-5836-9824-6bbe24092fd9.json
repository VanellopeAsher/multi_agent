Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, it is necessary to understand the concept of work done and rate of work. \n\nAccording to the problem statement, an individual can paint half of the house in 5 days. This implies the individual can paint the entire house in 10 days. \n\nSince the rate of work is a measure of the quantity of work done per unit of time, we have:\n\nIndividual rate of work = 1 house / 10 days \n\nAlso, rate of work for 'n' number of people is 'n' times the rate of work of a single person. \n\nHence, the rate of work for a team of 5 individuals is:\n\nTeam rate of work = 5 * Individual rate of work  \n\nFinally, the time it takes to complete painting an entire house can be calculated as the reciprocal of the team's rate of work, i.e., \n\nTime = 1 / Team rate of work\n\nNote: We have calculated the time in days. We need to convert the time to hours (since 1 day = 24 hours).\n\nLet's calculate this Python."

This is the number of hours it will take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house, given that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days.\n\nVerification:\nThe problem stated that one person could paint half a house in 5 days, so it would take them 10 days to paint a full house. \n\nWe assumed that the rate of work for a group of workers is equal to the sum of the rates of work of the members. Thus, a team of 5 individuals would paint the house five times as quickly, reducing the time to 2 days.\n\nFinally, we converted the time from days to hours (since 1 day = 24 hours), which resulted in 48 hours. This aligns with the final answer, which verifies that the problem-solving approach was correct."
