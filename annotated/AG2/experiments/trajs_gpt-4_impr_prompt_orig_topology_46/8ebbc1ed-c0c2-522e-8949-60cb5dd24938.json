However, on Monday, the teacher had to conduct an extra class for his students who needed additional help.

Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

First, we calculate the length of chalk remaining after Monday.\n2. After that, we simulate the daily chalk consumption from Tuesday onwards, stopping when the chalk has been reduced to less than 2 inches.\n3.

Then, it simulates the daily reduction in the length of the chalk from Tuesday onwards, stopping when the chalk length is less than 2 inches. Finally, it prints the total number of days the chalk was used."

This includes Monday when he used 45% of the chalk, and two more days of using the chalk at his usual rate of 20%.\n\nLet's verify this one more time.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. That means he used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday, leaving him with 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.\n2. On Tuesday, he resumed using his usual rate of 20% of the chalk. 20% of 2.75 inches equates to 0.55 inches, so he would be left with 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.2 inches of chalk at the end of Tuesday.\n3. On Wednesday, he would again use 20% of the remaining chalk. 20% of 2.2 inches is 0.44 inches. Subtracting this from the chalk's remaining length gives 2.2 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches.\n\nAfter Wednesday, the remaining piece of chalk would be less than 2 inches (the minimum length the teacher can use), which checks out with my previous calculation that the piece of chalk will last for 3 days. Therefore, I am confident in my answer."
