Subtract the result from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on pizza.\n3. Divide the cost for pizza by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes were ordered. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost Chicken, Milk, and Apples:\n    - Chicken costs: 1 * $12 = $12\n    - Milk costs: 5 * $3.5 = $17.5\n    - Apples cost:  4 * $1.5 = $6 \n    - So, the total for chicken, milk, and apples = $12 + $17.5 + $6 = $35.5\n\n2. To know how much was spent on pizza, we subtract the cost of chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount spent: $52.5 - $35.5 = $17 \n\n3. Finally, we find the number of pizza boxes by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one pizza box: $17 รท $8.5 = 2 boxes\n\nTherefore, Marie ordered two boxes of pizza."

      "content": "The code calculated the total spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples by multiplying the prices of the items with their quantities, which equaled 35.5 dollars as expected. The code calculated the amount spent on pizza by subtracting the total spent on the other item from the total amount spent, yielding 17 dollars, which is correct. The number of pizza boxes is then determined by dividing the total spent on pizza by the cost per box, resulting in 2 boxes. Since half boxes are not possible, the integer part of the result is taken, which also results in 2 boxes. Important to note that there is no rounding off in price calculation which can lead to inaccurate results. Since the logic and calculations align with our expectations, the final solution is 2 boxes of pizza.\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2}."
