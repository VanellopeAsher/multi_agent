      "content": "We need to find out the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne's sister to Joanne from the shortest trees. \n\nHere are the steps to solve it:\n\n1. Determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees: We know that she got half as many from the shortest trees as from the tallest which is 30 apples, therefore she got 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.\n\n2. Determine how many apples Joanne's sister gathered from the tallest trees: We know that she gathered twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne, who gathered 30 apples. Therefore Joanne's sister gathered 30*2 = 60 apples.\n\n3. Calculate how many apples in total Joanne gathered: \n    From the tallest trees: 30 apples\n    From the shortest trees: 15 apples\n    From the average trees: 350 apples\n    So, Joanne's total = 30 (tall) + 15 (short) + 350 (average) = 395 apples\n\n4. Find out how many apples her sister gathered from the shortest trees: We know that the sisters combined gathered 500 apples. If Joanne gathered 395, then her sister gathered 500-395 = 105 apples. However, her sister gathered 60 apples from the tallest trees, which means she must have gathered 105-60 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n\n5. Now, to find out how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees, we need to divide the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees by the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees. \n    So, Ratio = Joanne's sister's short tree apples / Joanne's short tree apples = 45/15\n\nLet's now calculate the Ratio."
