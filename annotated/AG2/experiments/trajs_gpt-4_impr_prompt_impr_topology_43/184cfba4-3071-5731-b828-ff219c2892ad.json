      "content": "Let's use algebra to solve the problem. \n\nStep 1: Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold by Teresa as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'y'. From the problem, we know she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can express this mathematically as 'x = 2y'.\n\nStep 2: We know that each small stuffed animal costs $40, and it is given that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. So, the price for a large stuffed animal is 3 * $40 = $120.\n\nStep 3: We also know that Teresa earned $1200 from selling these stuffed animals. So we can write that down as an equation using 'x' and 'y'. We know that the earning (E) equates to:\n\nE = x * price_small + y * price_large\n\nSubstituting the values for the prices and the earnings, we get:\n\n$1200 = x * $40 + y * $120\n\nReplacing 'x' by '2y' (since 'x = 2y', obtained from step 1) in the equation, we get:\n\n$1200 = 2y * $40 + y * $120 = 80y + 120y = 200y\n\nStep 4: Now, we can solve this equation for 'y'. Once we find 'y', we can plug it into 'x = 2y' to determine the number of small stuffed animals sold by Teresa. \n\nSolving for y gives:\n\ny = $1200/200 = 6 \n\nStep 5: Once we determined 'y' (the number of large animals), we can find 'x' (the number of small animals) with the equation 'x = 2y', so:\n\nx = 2*6 = 12\n\nSo, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."
