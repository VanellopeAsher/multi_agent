Given that Marty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon and he needs to cut it into 40 equal parts, we first need to divide the 10,000 by 40. This would give the length of each cut.\n2. Then, each of these 40 cuts will further need to be divided into 50 equal parts. To get the length of these final cuts, we should divide the length of the 40 cuts by 50.\n\nSo, by following these steps, we should be able to find out how long each final cut will be."

Calculates the length of each part after dividing Marty's 10,000 millimeter ribbon into 40 parts,\n2. Then, takes each of these parts and further calculates how long it becomes after dividing it into 50.\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution: \n\n```python\n# declare the total length of the ribbon in millimeters\ntotal_ribbon_length = 10000  # in millimeters\n\n# calculate the length of each part after the first division (10,000/40)\nfirst_division_length = total_ribbon_length / 40\n\n# calculate the length of each part after the second division (first division's result/50)\nfinal_cut_length = first_division_length / 50\n\n# display the length of each cut after the two divisions\nprint(final_cut_length)\n``` \n\nLet's run this now."

Here's a summary:\n\nThe Problem Solver suggested we divide the total ribbon length (10,000 millimeters) into 40 equal parts first, and then divide each of these parts into 50 equal parts. This is a correct and logical solution to the problem. \n\nThe Code Executor wrote Python code following these steps and executed it. According to the code, the total ribbon length (10,000 millimeters) divided by 40 gives the first division length, and then this first division length divided by 50 provides the final cut length. The output of the code execution shows that each final cut will be 5 millimeters long.\n\nTherefore, the final solution to the problem is that each final cut of the ribbon will be 5 millimeters long.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 5"
