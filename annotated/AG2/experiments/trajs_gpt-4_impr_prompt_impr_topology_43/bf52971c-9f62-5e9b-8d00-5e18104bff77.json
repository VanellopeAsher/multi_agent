Compute the amount of money Ali gives to his sister (which is half of the total money he has).\n3. Find out how much money Ali has left with him after giving his sister her share.\n4. Determine how much Ali uses to buy dinner, which is 3/5 of the amount left after giving his sister.\n5. Subtract the amount used for dinner from his remaining money to find out Ali's final balance.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n1. Initially, Ali has 4 bills of $10 each and 6 bills of $20 each. Hence the initial total amount = 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = $40 + $120 = $160.\n2. Ali gives his sister half of this money. So, the money given to sister = $160 / 2 = $80\n3. The remaining money with Ali = $160 - $80 = $80\n4. Ali uses 3/5 of this remaining money to buy dinner. So, the money used for dinner = 3/5 * $80 = $48\n5. Finally, money left with Ali = $80 - $48 = $32 \n\nTherefore, Ali is left with $32 after buying dinner. We haven't been asked to calculate the amount the sister gives to their mother, so this step isn't included in the solution."

The money Ali has after buying dinner.\n\nWe will use this information to find out how much Ali is left with after all these transactions. \n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n```python\n# the initial total amount Ali has\ninitial_amount = 4 * 10 + 6 * 20\n\n# the amount Ali gives to his sister\nsister_share = initial_amount / 2\n\n# the amount left with Ali after giving to his sister\nafter_sister = initial_amount - sister_share\n\n# the amount used to buy dinner\ndinner_cost = 3/5 * after_sister\n\n# final amount left with Ali after buying the dinner\nfinal_amount = after_sister - dinner_cost\n\nprint(final_amount)\n```\n\nEven though the problem mentions Ali's sister giving money to their mother, the problem doesn't specifically ask for that amount to be calculated, so we will ignore that part for now."
