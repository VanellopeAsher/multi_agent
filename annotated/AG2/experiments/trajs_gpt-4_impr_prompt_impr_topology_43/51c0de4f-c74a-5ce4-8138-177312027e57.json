Since lawyer donated $6600 in total, it means the total amount collected from everyone else (before the lawyer's donation) was $6600 / 3 = $2200.\n\nStep 3: We know that total which Walter collected before the lawyer's contribution was $2000. So, the contribution from his friend will be the difference between total (before the lawyer's donation) and the total from neighbours and the online fund, which is $2200-$2000= $200.\n\nHence, his friend gave him $200."
