I appreciate your intent in trying to use the formula to move the variables around to solve for 'E2', but in this case, we don't have a value for 'T' or 'E2'.\n\nWe have the following given in the question:\n\n1. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs.\n2. There are 10 eggs left that are unfound.\n3. The friends found \"all the other eggs\" - the meaning of which is that they found everything else that the twins didn't find.\n\nFrom these points, we understand that the twins found a total of 60 eggs (30 eggs each), and that the friends found everything else except for the 10 unfound eggs.\n\nWe don't have a total number of eggs 'T', but we know that the total number of found eggs (not including the 10 unfound eggs) is the number of eggs the twins found (60) plus the number of eggs that the friends found. Hence, without knowing 'T', we can say:\n\nnumber of eggs friends found = total number of found eggs - number of eggs twins found\n\nSince the total number of found eggs is 'T' - 10, the equation becomes:\n\nnumber of eggs friends found = 'T' - 10 - number of eggs twins found\n\nSince 'T' isn't given, we can't calculate an actual number for the number of eggs the friends found with the information given in the problem."

It merely states: \"All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.\"\n\n- The total number of eggs that were found by the Smith twins: 2 * 30 = 60 eggs.\n\n- The term \"All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends\" denotes that the number of eggs found by their friends is the total number of eggs minus the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the remaining unfound eggs. However, the total number of eggs isn't provided.\n\nConclusively, the problem is unsolvable with the given information.
