We know he killed 10 wolves, and some cougars, but we do not know the exact amount of cougars.\n\n2. We know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Let's denote the amount of cougars Rick killed today as x. This would mean that today he killed 3x wolves. \n\n3. We also know that today he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Since we denoted the number of cougars Rick killed today as x, that would mean that on the first night he killed x + 3 cougars. \n\n4. Now we need to add together the number of animals Rick killed on the first and second (today's) days. On the first day it would be 10 (wolves) + (x + 3) (cougars), and on the second day it would be 3x (wolves) + x (cougars).\n\n5. To get the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to find x which will satisfy the condition but we need more information for this. \n\nBased on the information given, we cannot conclude the exact number of animals Rick killed without more information about the number of cougars Rick killed the first night."

There are enough variables in the problem (the number of cougars killed on the first night and the second) that we cannot conclusively solve for the total number of animals killed without introducing unwarranted assumptions. Since writing Python code to illustrate this wouldn't change the conclusion, I concur that the information presented is insufficient to provide an exact answer. We need more information about the number of cougars Rick killed on the first night. Thus, there is not a Python code to be written due to lack of necessary information."
