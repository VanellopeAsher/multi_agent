So, we multiply the height of the beanstalk from the first week by 2. \n\nStep 3: In the third week, the beanstalk grew an unknown number of inches. \n\nStep 4: At the end of the third week, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall. \n\nSo, we can find how much it grew in the third week by subtracting the height of the beanstalk at the end of the second week from the total height at the end of the third week. To put that into a formula:\n\nGrowth in third week = Total height at end of third week - Height at end of second week. \n\nLet's calculate this."
