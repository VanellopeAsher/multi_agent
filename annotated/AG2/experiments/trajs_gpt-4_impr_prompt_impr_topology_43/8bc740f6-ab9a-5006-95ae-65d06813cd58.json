The total numbers of days in February is given as 2.8 times of ten days.\n\nTo find the total number of articles published by both companies in February, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate daily total articles published by both companies.\n2. Compute the total number of days in February.\n3. Multiply daily total articles by the total number of days in February to get the total number of articles published in the month.\n\nLet's calculate:\n1. Daily total articles of both companies: 20 (from the news website) + 10 (from sister company) = 30 total articles daily.\n2. Total number of days in February: 2.8 * 10 = 28 days.\n3. Total articles in February: 30 articles/day * 28 days = 840 articles. \n\nHence, the two websites published a total of 840 articles in February."
