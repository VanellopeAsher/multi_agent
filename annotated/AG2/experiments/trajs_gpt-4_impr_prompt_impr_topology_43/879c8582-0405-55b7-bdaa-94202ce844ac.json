She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. This totals 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards. \n\n2. She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each, so that's 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.\n\n3. Adding her special collection of rare soccer cards, the overall total becomes 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards + 30 soccer cards = 380 total cards.\n\n4. After Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, she gives the rest to her students. The cards left for the students would then be 380 total cards - 50 kept cards = 330 cards for the students.\n\n5. If each student gets 10 cards, then the number of students she has would be 330 cards for the students divided by 10 cards per student, which gives us 33 students. \n\nSo, according to my calculations, Miss Maria has 33 students. I'll pass this over to Agent Code Executor to find if we receive the same number of students using Python code."

According to their calculations, Miss Maria has 33 students, which makes sense based on the problem's given information. \n\nThe solution was found by firstly calculating the total quantity of cards that Miss Maria has by adding up the number of basketball cards, baseball cards, and rare soccer cards. After deducting the 50 cards Miss Maria kept for herself, the remaining amount was divided by ten (the number of cards each student receives) to find the total number of students. \n\nGiven that both obtained solutions are matching and are logically sound, I would conclude that the final answer is 33 students.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{33}**."
