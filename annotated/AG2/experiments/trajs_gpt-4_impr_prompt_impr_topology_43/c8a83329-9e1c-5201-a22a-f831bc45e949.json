After that, we subtract the number of cards Erica gave to her classmates and family. From the problem, we know that she gave out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family.\n3. Finally, we add the number of cards Erica received from family and friends, which is stated as 17.\n\nNote: Since the problem does not specify how many cards are in each box that her dad brought, it would be good to have that information to solve the problem accurately."

If we were to assume that each box had say 10 cards (a typical number of cards in a Valentine's box), she would have started with 40 cards (20 she made and 20 from dad). After giving out 29, she would be left with 11. Adding the 17 she got, she would have 28 cards. The answer therefore, under that assumption, is 28 cards.
