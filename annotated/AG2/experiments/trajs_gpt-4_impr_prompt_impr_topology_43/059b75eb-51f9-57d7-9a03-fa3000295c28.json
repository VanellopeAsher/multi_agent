On the second day, the volume of water doubles due to intense rainfall. Therefore, we multiply the initial volume by 2. Calculation: 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n3. On the third day, an additional amount of water, 6000 gallons, is added to the volume at that point in the river. We then add this additional volume to the volume on the second day. Calculation: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.\n\nSo, the total volume of water flowing through that point on the third day is 14000 gallons."

Now let's verify the proposed solutions.\n\nAgent Problem Solver's solution involved simple arithmetic operations to determine the total volume of water flowing through the river on the third day, which resulted in a calculation of 14000 gallons. The current water volume was multiplied by 2 to account for the intense rainfall and then 6000 gallons was added to this result.\n\nAgent Code Executor also proposed the use of similar arithmetic operations implemented with Python, which resulted in an output of 14000 gallons. This is consistent with the solution proposed by Agent Problem Solver.\n\nAfter a diligent evaluation of both solutions, it is clear that they match perfectly, having followed the right sequence of steps and using correct arithmetic operations without any assumptions. Therefore, the total volume of water flowing through the river on the third day is 14000 gallons.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{14000}**."
