If the division is not a round number, we will round it up to the next integer since we cannot buy a fraction of a box.\nThus,\n1. total_smores = (9 children * 2 smores/child) + (6 adults * 1 smore/adult)\n2. smores_per_box = 3 packets/box * 8 smores/packet\n3. boxes_needed = ceil(total_smores / smores_per_box)"

For step 2, we also follow the calculation directly. In step 3, we use the `math.ceil()` function to round up the result to the nearest integer. This function is part of the `math` module, which we need to import. \n\nLet's see it in code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1\nchildren = 9\nsmores_per_child = 2\nadults = 6\nsmores_per_adult = 1\n\ntotal_smores = (children * smores_per_child) + (adults * smores_per_adult)\n\n# Step 2\npackets_per_box = 3\nsmores_per_packet = 8\n\nsmores_per_box = packets_per_box * smores_per_packet\n\n# Step 3\nboxes_needed = math.ceil(total_smores / smores_per_box)\n\nprint(boxes_needed)\n```\nLet's run this code. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

They calculated the total number of smores needed, estimated the amount of smores obtained from one box of graham crackers, and then determined how many boxes are required by employing the ceil function to round up the result to the next integer, if necessary.\n\nAgent Code Executor implemented the described solution in Python and accordingly obtained the output of '1'. This suggests that only 1 box of graham crackers is needed, which concurs with the initial outline of Agent Problem Solver.\n\nUpon analyzing their answers, both agents did not make assumptions; they only worked with the given information. They also did not have conflicting solutions, so there is no need for additional discussion.\n\nHence, taking into account these evaluations, the final solution is: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{1}**. Only 1 box of graham crackers is needed."
