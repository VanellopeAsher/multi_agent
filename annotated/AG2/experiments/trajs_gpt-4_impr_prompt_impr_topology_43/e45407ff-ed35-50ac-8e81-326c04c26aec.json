      "content": "Here are the steps I'd suggest to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, let's figure out the cost of a bottle of scotch. If John paid $600 for 10 bottles of scotch, this means each bottle costs $600/10 = $60.\n\n2. Now, let's find out about the cognac. He bought twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he bought 2*10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n\n3. If a bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch, it means each bottle of cognac costs $60 * 1.5 = $90.\n\n4. Since he bought 20 bottles of cognac, he spent 20 * $90 = $1800 on cognac.\n\n5. Finally, we add the total amount spent on scotch and cognac. $600 (for scotch) + $1800 (for cognac) = $2400. \n\nSo, John spent a total of $2400 on alcohol. \n\nThe alcohol content is not relevant for the computation of the total spending, as it doesn't affect the total cost. So, we can disregard it in this problem. Now let's discuss this approach."
