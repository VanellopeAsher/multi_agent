Compute how much he earned from babysitting his neighbors' kids.  \n    Itâ€™s stated that Gerald babysat for two hours each day for a week but was not paid for it. Therefore, the amount is $0.\n3.  Sum up the total earnings. Which is, the earnings from the daycare work (Step 1) and babysitting (Step 2).\n4.  Subtract the total expenses (which is $100) from the total earnings.  The result would be the amount of money Gerald has left. \n\nWe need to note that he did not earn any money from babysitting, which doesn't contribute to his earnings."

It was stated that Gerald didn't earn anything from babysitting, so there's no amount to add to the total earnings.\n3.

First, we calculated Gerald's earnings for a week working at the daycare, which totals $30 a day, yielding $30 * 7 = $210. Gerald did not earn anything from babysitting, so there was no need to include it in his total earnings.\n\nAfterward, Gerald's total expenses of $100 were subtracted from his total earnings of $210 ($210 - $100), resulting in $110, which matches the output obtained from executing the Python code.\n\nHence, the correct answer is $110.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{110}**."
