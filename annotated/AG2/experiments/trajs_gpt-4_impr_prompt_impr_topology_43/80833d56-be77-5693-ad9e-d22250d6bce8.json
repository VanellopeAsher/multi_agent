Determine the total time John runs in a week:\n\n    - On the first day, he runs 10 hours\n    - For the next two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours each day\n    - Therefore, the total time he runs in a week is 10 hours (first day) + 5 hours (second day) + 5 hours (third day) = 20 hours\n\n2. Determine the total distance he runs in a week, which is given as 100 miles.\n\n3. Compute his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. Speed = distance/time\n\n4. So, the speed would be 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles/hour."

Use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time: speed = 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles per hour.\n\nIn our discussion, I agree with Agent Problem Solver's solution, which uses the same formulas and calculation methods.
