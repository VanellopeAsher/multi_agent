From the information given, Sam ran 3.5 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday which equates to 3 days.  Sam ran 5.5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday which equates to 2 days.\n2. Next, figure out the total distance Sam ran on the 3.5 miles days and the 5.5 miles days.  Do this by multiplying the distance per day by the number of these days. \n3. Then, add the total distances ran from both the 3.5 mile days and the 5.5 mile days to get the total miles ran for the week.\n4. Therefore, using the steps above, the total distance ran for the week can be calculated as:  \n        (3.5 miles/day * 3 days) + (5.5 miles/day * 2 days)"

Agent Problem Solver's solution gave a straightforward way to calculate the total distance. Agent Code Executor expanded on this by providing Python code that precisely accomplishes the calculation.\n\nLet's go through the solution again:\n\n1. Sam ran 3.5 miles a day for 3 days: 3.5 miles/day * 3 days = 10.5 miles\n2. Sam ran 5.5 miles a day for 2 days: 5.5 miles/day * 2 days = 11 miles\n3. Add up the total distance: 10.5 miles + 11 miles = 21.5 miles\n\nTherefore, Sam ran a total of 21.5 miles this week."
