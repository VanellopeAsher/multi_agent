If a gallon jar costs $5.5, then a half-gallon jar would cost $5.5 minus $2.5, which is $3. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent on gallon jars and half-gallon jars. She bought 10-gallon jars, so the amount spent on gallon jars would be 10 multiplied by the cost of a gallon jar (10*$5.5), and she also bought 16 half-gallon jars, so the amount spent on half-gallon jars would be 16 multiplied by the cost of a half-gallon jar (16*$3).\n\nFinally, to get the total amount of money spent, we add the amount spent on gallon jars to the amount spent on half-gallon jars. Let's calculate it."
