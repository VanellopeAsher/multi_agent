      "content": "Step 1: Understand the Problem.\n\n       Tim spends 6 hours each day answering calls and it takes 15 minutes for each call. This is the case from Monday to Thursday. On Fridays, he spends an extra 2 hours on top of the usual 6 hours. We need to find out how many calls he handles throughout his 5-day workweek.\n\nStep 2: Convert Hours to Minutes.\n\n       Since Tim's time spent on each call is given in minutes, it's useful to convert all the hours he works into minutes for easier calculations. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so:\n       Normal daily hours: 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day.\n       Extra hours on Friday: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\n\nStep 3: Determine the Number of Calls in a Normal Day and On Friday.\n\n       To find out how many calls Tim handles in a day, we need to divide the total minutes he works by the number of minutes it takes him to handle one call.\n       Normal daily calls: 360 minutes/day รท 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day.\n       Calls handled during extra time on Friday: 120 minutes รท 15 minutes/call = 8 calls.\n\nStep 4: Determine the Total Number of Calls in a Week.\n\n       In a 5-day workweek, Tim works 4 normal days (Monday to Thursday) and 1 extended day (Friday). So, the total number of calls he handles will be the number of calls on regular days times 4 plus the number of calls he handles on Friday (normal calls + extra calls).\n       Total Calls = (Normal calls * 4 days) + (Normal Calls on Friday + Extra Calls on Friday).\n       \n\nLet's also remember that in this problem we are assuming that every single call takes exactly 15 minutes. In real-life scenarios, calls may take less or more time. This solution provides an approximate number."

In minutes, this is 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour\n- For Friday, we have an additional 2 hours. In minutes, this is 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour\n\nStep 2: We compute the number of calls handled:\n\n- On a normal day, given it takes 15 minutes per call, the number of calls is Normal Daily minutes / 15 minutes per call\n- On Friday, the additional number of calls handled in the extra time is Extra Friday minutes / 15 minutes per call\n\nStep 3: We compute the total number of calls:\n\n- For normal days, this is Calls per normal day * 4\n- On Friday, it is Calls per normal day + extra Calls on Friday\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation."
