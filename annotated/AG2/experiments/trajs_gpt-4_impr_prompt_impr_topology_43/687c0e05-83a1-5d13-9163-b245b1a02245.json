First, identify the total number of unicorns in Scotland: Given that 2/3 of Scottish unicorns are female and we know there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, we can infer that 3/3 or the total number of unicorns in Scotland must be equal to 3 * 6, which is 18 unicorns.\n\n2. Second, determine the total world population of unicorns: Knowing that 1/3 of the world's unicorns are in Scotland and we've already determined there are 18 unicorns in Scotland. So, if these 18 represent the 1/3, then the total must be 3 * 18, which gets us 54 unicorns worldwide.\n\n3. Finally, calculate the total number of unicorns outside Scotland: Subtract the number of unicorns in Scotland from the total world population (54 - 18) to get the number of unicorns outside Scotland.\n\nThis is the basic approach to the problem. Now, let's solve this problem and get the answer."

It multiplies the number of female unicorns in Scotland (6) by 3 to get the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n   In Python: total_unicorns_scotland = 3 * num_female_unicorns_scotland\n   This should provide total_unicorns_scotland as 18.\n\n2. It then multiplies the total number of unicorns in Scotland (18) by 3 to get the total number of unicorns worldwide.\n   In Python: unicorns_worldwide = 3 * total_unicorns_scotland\n   This should provide unicorns_worldwide as 54.\n\n3. Finally, it subtracts the total number of unicorns in Scotland (18) from the total number of unicorns worldwide (54) to get the number of unicorns outside Scotland.\n   In Python: unicorns_outside_scotland = unicorns_worldwide - total_unicorns_scotland\n   This should provide unicorns_outside_scotland as 36.\n\nThus, based on your Python code, there should be 36 unicorns outside Scotland."

Agent Problem Solver deciphered the problem correctly and developed an easy-to-follow action plan. It calculated the total number of unicorns in Scotland based on the given proportion of female unicorns, then deduced the global unicorn population based on the given percentage of Scottish unicorns, and calculated the number of unicorns outside Scotland.\n\n2. Agent Code Executor structured clear Python instructions following Agent Problem Solver's guidelines and translated them correctly into tangible actions to find a solution.\n\nIn sum, if there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, which comprise two-thirds of the Scottish unicorn population, then the total number of unicorns in Scotland is 18. As this adds up to a third of the global unicorn population, there is a total of 54 unicorns worldwide. Consequently, there are 36 unicorns outside Scotland."

The case seems to be resolved and I propose to close it. \n\nAccording to the information given, if there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland and they comprise two-thirds of all Scottish unicorns (indicating there are 18 unicorns in Scotland as this represents a third of all unicorns worldwide), then there are 54 unicorns worldwide. Consequently, subtracting the Scottish unicorns from the total, we learn that there are 36 unicorns in the rest of the globe."
