Multiply the number of cars by 4, because each car uses 4 wheels.\n2. Multiply the number of motorcycles by 2, because each motorcycle uses 2 wheels.\n3. Add the results of the two previous steps. This gives us the total number of wheels used by the cars and motorcycles.\n4. To find the total amount of wheels that were initially in the box, we add the number of wheels used by the cars and motorcycles (from step 3) to the 276 remaining wheels in the box.
