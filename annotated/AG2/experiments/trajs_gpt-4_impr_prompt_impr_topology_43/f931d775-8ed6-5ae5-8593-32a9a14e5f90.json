The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so that’s 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Sean has to memorize a third of these lines which is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.\n3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so that’s 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Sean has to memorize four-fifths of these lines which is 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.\n4. Finally, Sean has to memorize an additional 15 lines because one actor can't come.\n\nAdding these together, we will find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize.\n"
