Given that each final cut is 5 cm, and it is a result of dividing the second cut into 5 equal parts, we can multiply 5 cm by 5 to get the length of each second cut. \n\n2. Then, as each of the primary cuts is divided into these second cuts, we multiply this length by 5 to get the length of each primary cut.\n\n3. Since the entire ribbon is divided into these 4 primary cuts, we again multiply this length by 4 to get the total length of the ribbon.\n\nThis approach should help reveal the ribbon's length when reverse engineered from the final cuts."

Based on the final given cut, a series of multiplications is performed, which ultimately reveals the length of the original ribbon. \n\nAccording to the provided solution, the following calculation sequence was proposed and implemented:\n\n1. Each final cut is 5 cm, so the length of each second cut (one level higher) is 5 cm * 5 = 25 cm. \n\n2. Each primary cut (the next level up) is then 25 cm * 5 = 125 cm.\n\n3. The total length of the ribbon is determined by multiplying the length of the primary cut by the number of primary cuts (4), therefore 125 cm * 4 = 500 cm.\n\nThe output of Agent Code Executor's program confirms these calculations and outputs a total length of 500 cm.\n\nAs a result, the original length of the ribbon, when reverse-engineered from the final cuts, is in fact 500 cm.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is: \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{500}"
