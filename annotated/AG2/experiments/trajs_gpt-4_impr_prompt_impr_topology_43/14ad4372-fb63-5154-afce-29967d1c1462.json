Since Judy teaches 5 classes per day, from Monday to Friday, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.\n    \nStep 2: If we add the eight classes she teaches on Saturday, we get 25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes per week.\n    \nStep 3: Judy has 15 students in each class. If she charges $15 per student for each class, then the total amount she gets per class is 15 students * $15 = $225.\n    \nStep 4: To find out how much Judy makes in 1 week, we multiply the amount she earns per class by the total number of classes she teaches per week. This gives us $225/class * 33 classes = $7425.\n\nTherefore, Judy makes $7425 in one week."

This indicates that Judy earn $7425 in one week. \n\nLet's verify this with the step by step solution provided by Agent Problem Solver:\n\nThe calculation done by Agent Problem Solver seems correct. \n\n- The first step calculates the total classes on weekdays which is matched by the code.\n- The second step adds the Saturday classes to the total which is also done in the code.\n- The third step calculates the amount earned per class.\n- The fourth and final step calculates the total amount earned in a week.\n\nBoth solutions agree with each other and seem to follow the problem's instructions faithfully without making any unsupported assumptions. The data handled by the code also matches the explicitly given variables in the original problem statement. \n\nSo, the total amount of money Judy makes in a week is $7425.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{7425}"
