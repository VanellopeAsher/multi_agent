This doesn't align with the real-world scenario as it is not possible to buy a fraction of a pack of canvas bags. \n\nThere may be a discrepancy in the numbers provided in the problem or an error in our calculation. We assumed that Tara sold all the bags she bought. If that's not the case and she sold only a portion of them to earn the profit, the result could be fractional.\n\nLet's check the calculations again. First, let's use the simpler form of the profit equation: Profit = Revenue - Cost.\n\nGiven:\n- Cost of each bag = $4/5\n- Selling price of each bag = $8\n- Total profit = $160\n\nLet's denote:\n- The number of bags Tara bought as B.\n- The number of bags Tara sold to get the profit as S (which for our initial calculation we assumed equals B).\n\nSo we have: $160 = S*$8 - B*($4/5)\n\nIn our current understanding S = B which leads to: 160 = B*($8 - $4/5)\n\nLet's recalculate if there's a mistake here.

Since each pack contains 5 bags, the cost of each individual bag is $4/5 = $0.8. Therefore, when Tara sold each bag for $8, her profit per bag sold was $8 - $0.8 = $7.2. Now, to earn a total profit of $160, we find the number of individual bags sold as $160/$7.2.\n\nSince bags are bought in packs of 5, we divide the total number of bags by 5 to calculate the number of packs.\n\n```python\n# Calculating the number of bags before converting to packs\nC1_per_bag = C1 / 5\nProfit_per_bag = S1 - C1_per_bag\nnum_bags = Profit / Profit_per_bag\n\n# Converting the number of bags to packs\nnum_packs = num_bags / 5\n\nprint(num_packs)\n```\nThe value we get for num_packs should be the number of packs Tara bought.\n\nLet's execute this code."

All bags sold at the same price of $8.\n\nIf these assumptions were not correct, it could explain the fractional result - either she sold more than 4 packs but not quite 5 packs, or the selling price was not uniform.\n\nUnfortunately, without more detail or clearer constraints provided in the problem, we can only conjectural based on the given information. It might be best to consider our numeric answer as approximately 5 packs, rounding up since selling partial bags from a pack may not be possible."
