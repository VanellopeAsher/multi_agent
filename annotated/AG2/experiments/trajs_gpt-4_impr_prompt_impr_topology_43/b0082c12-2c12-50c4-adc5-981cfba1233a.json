The first problem stated the kitten broke 4 vases, but the second problem asked to calculate for a total of 6 vases. If we're to count the first 4 vases and the next 6 vases as separate instances, the total broken vases would be 10, not 6.\n\nSo, the corrected total cost involved would be $200 (spaying) + $54 (vaccines) + $120 (10 vases) = $374.\n\nFor this particular problem, it's crucial to clarify whether the 6 vases are separate from or inclusive of the initial 4 vases. We assumed it to be a separate occurrence and hence calculated for a total of 10 broken vases. If the 6 vases include the initial 4 vases then the cost would otherwise be $326.

This suggests that the total tally of broken vases is now standing at 6, with the new broken vases being on top of the initially broken 4.\n\nWith this understanding, the calculation would be as follows:\n\n- Spaying cost = $200\n- Vaccine cost (with discount) = 3 * 20 * (1 - 0.1) = $54\n- Vase replacement cost for 6 vases = 6 * 12 = $72\n\nAdding these up, the total cost is $200 (spaying) + $54 (vaccines) + $72 (vases) = $326. \n\nThis misinterpretation shows how important clear communication and comprehension are in problem-solving. The revised total cost of Leah's kitten would then be $326, not $374. This should be verified again by executing the Python code using the updated total vase count."
