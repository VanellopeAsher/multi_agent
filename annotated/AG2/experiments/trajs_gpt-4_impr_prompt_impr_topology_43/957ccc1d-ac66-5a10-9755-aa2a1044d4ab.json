Since 1 lb. equals 3500 calories, the total calorie deficit necessary is 30 lbs. * 3500 calories/lb. \n\n2. Next, we need to find the total number of days from now until Andy’s birthday. \n\n3. Lastly, we divide the total calorie deficit by the total number of days to find the daily calorie deficit necessary.\n\nLet's follow this process."

The total calorie deficit required would be:\n\n```python\ntotal_pound_loss = 30\ncalories_per_pound = 3500\ntotal_calorie_deficit = total_pound_loss * calories_per_pound\n```\n\nStep 2: Find the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:\nWe can use Python's built-in datetime module which provides classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. Assuming the current year is 2022:\n \n```python\nfrom datetime import date\ntoday_date = date(2022, 12, 31)\nbirthday_date = date(2023, 7, 19)\ntotal_days = (birthday_date - today_date).days\n```\n\nStep 3: Find the daily caloric deficit\nNow we can find the daily caloric deficit by dividing the total caloric deficit by the total number of days:\n\n```python\ndaily_calorie_deficit = total_calorie_deficit / total_days\n```\n\nLet me run these calculations."

The code first calculates the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 pounds, then counts the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th, and finally finds the net amount of daily calories needed by dividing the total calorie deficit by the total number of days.\n\nTherefore, to reach his goal, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories.\n\nHence, final solution is: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{525}**. This indicates that Andy needs a net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed to be 525 calories each day to reach his goal by his birthday."
