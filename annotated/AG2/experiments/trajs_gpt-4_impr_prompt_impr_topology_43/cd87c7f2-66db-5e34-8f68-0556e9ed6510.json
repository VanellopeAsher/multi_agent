So, the total number of balloons they started with is 100 balloons per pack multiplied by 10 packs, which is 1000 balloons.\n\n2. Second, find out how many balloons were used by subtracting the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with. They ended the afternoon with 120 balloons left. So, subtract 120 from 1000.\n\n3. The result from step 2 is the number of balloons they threw. \n\nLet's write this solution mathematically:\n\nTotal Balloons = 100 (per pack) * 10 (packs) = 1000 Balloons\nBalloons thrown = Total Balloons - Balloons Left \n                            = 1000 - 120 \n                            = 880 Balloons thrown"
