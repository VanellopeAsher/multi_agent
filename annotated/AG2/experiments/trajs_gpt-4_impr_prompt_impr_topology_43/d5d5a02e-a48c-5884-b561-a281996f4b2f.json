      "content": "To solve this problem, it is possible to use algebra. Let's denote Emil's age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. From the problem we know:\n\n1) E is currently 21.\n2) In 5 years, E will be 26 years old, which will be half the age of his dad at that time. This gives us the equation: E + 5 = 1/2 * (D + 5)\n3) Also in 5 years, E will be twice as old as his brother. This gives us the equation: E + 5 = 2 * (B + 5)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find D and B, and then get the sum of their current ages (D + B).\n\nStep-by-Step solution:\n1) First, solve the equation from the dad's age:\n\nE + 5 = 1/2 * (D + 5)\n\nSubstitute E with 21 (since we know Emil's current age is 21), and solve for D:\n\n21 + 5 = 1/2 * (D + 5)\n\n26 = 1/2 * (D + 5)\n\nThen, multiply both sides of the equation by 2,\n\n2 * 26 = D + 5\n\nFinally, get D by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n\nD = 2 * 26 - 5\n\n2) Second, solve the equation from the brother's age:\n\nE + 5 = 2 * (B + 5)\n\nAgain, substitute E with 21:\n\n21 + 5 = 2 * (B + 5)\n\n26 = 2 * (B + 5)\n\nThen, divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n26 / 2 = B + 5\n\nFinally, get B by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n\nB = 26 / 2 - 5\n\n3) Now that we've found values for D and B, calculate their sum by adding the two values together:\n\nSum_age = D + B\n\nThis should give us the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother."

In step-by-step mathematical deductions as well as in python code, similar computations were adopted to figure out the problem's answer.\n\nLet's breakdown the processes from both agents:\n\nFrom Agent_Problem_Solver:\n1. Initial equations were formed based on the problem description.\n2. Emil's age was substituted into the equations before computations started.\n3. Both 'D' (Dad's future age) and 'B' (Brother's future age) values were computed.\n4. The present ages of Dad and Brother were computed and added to give '55'.\n\nFrom Agent_Code_Executor's Python Code:\n1. Emil's present age (21 years) was used as input.\n2. 'D' and 'B' values were computed similar to Agent_Problem_Solver's method.\n3. Current ages of Dad and Brother were computed.\n4. The sum of the current ages of Dad and Brother was calculated to give '55'.\n\nEvaluating the steps taken by both agents, it's reasonable to conclude that the computation was done correctly, and the proper procedures were observed. \n\nThus, **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{55}**. The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is 55."
