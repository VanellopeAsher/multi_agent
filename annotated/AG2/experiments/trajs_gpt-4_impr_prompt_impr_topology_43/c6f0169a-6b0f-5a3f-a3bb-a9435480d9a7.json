From the available data, we are informed that 12 cars are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remainder from the total of 20 cars are semi-automatic. Therefore, to discover the number of semi-automatic cars, you subtract the sum of automatic and manual cars (12 + 4) from the total car amount (20). \n2. Calculate the number of available cars. Three of the automatic cars are rented, and two manual cars are undergoing maintenance, hence are unavailable. From the overall car count, we subtract these unavailable cars to acquire the number of currently available cars.\n3. Compute the ratio that semi-automatic cars hold of the total available cars, and then convert that proportion to a percentage. The percentage can be calculated by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total available cars and then multiplying by 100. \n\nLet's find the solutions for each of these steps."

      "content": "Thanks, Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor, for your detailed solutions. Your process is correct for solving this problem.\n\n1. To calculate the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total car count. This gives us:\n   `semi_automatic_cars = total_cars - automatic_cars - manual_cars`\n\n2. To calculate the available cars, you correctly subtracted the unavailable cars (the rented automatic cars and the manual cars under maintenance) from the total. So, we get:\n   `available_cars = total_cars - rented_automatic_cars - under_maintenance_manual_cars`\n\n3. Finally, you correctly calculated the percentage by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total available cars and then multiplying by 100:\n   `semi_automatic_cars_percentage = (semi_automatic_cars / available_cars) * 100`\n\nExecuting the python code gives the result 26.666666666666668. \n\nSo, the percentage of the remaining available cars that are semi-automatic is approximately 26.67%.\n\nFINAL SOLUTION:  **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{26.67}**."
