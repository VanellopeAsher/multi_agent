First, let's define the information we have in terms of algebraic equations.\n\n   We know:\n   \n   a) Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has → K = M - 5\n   \n   b) Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster → M = 1.2(C + 10)\n   \n   c) Summer has 23 more cookies than Max → S = M + 23\n   \n   d) Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies → K = 6.8 * 10\n\n2. Since we know Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies, we can find out how many cookies Max has first.\n\n   To calculate that, we can use the information from d) and a):\n\n   M = K + 5\n   \n3. With Max's amount of cookies, we can determine how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by rearranging b):\n\n   C = (M/1.2) - 10 \n\n4. Now we know the amount of cookies for Max, Katarina, and the Cookie Monster.\n\n5. The final step is to calculate how many cookies Summer has, we can substitute M in c):\n\n   S = M + 23\n   \n6. To get the total number of cookies, add up the number of cookies that Katarina, Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have.\n\n    Total = K + M + C + S\n"
