Calculate the increase in price in December by multiplying the original price with the percentage increase and dividing by 100.\n\n    Increase_December = Original_Price * 80% = $4000 * 0.8\n\n2. Add this increase to the original price to get the new price in December.\n\n    New_Price_December = Original_Price + Increase_December\n\n3. Calculate the decrease in price in January by multiplying the new price in December with the percentage decrease and dividing by 100.\n\n    Decrease_January = New_Price_December * 50% \n\n4. Subtract this decrease from the new price in December to get the final price in January.\n\n    New_Price_January = New_Price_December - Decrease_January\n\nBy subsisting the original price of $4000 for Original_Price in these steps, we'll find the final price of the toy in January."
