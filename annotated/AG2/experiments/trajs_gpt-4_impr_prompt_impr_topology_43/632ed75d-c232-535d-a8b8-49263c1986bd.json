We are told that the second aircraft's 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Thus, the total flights made daily by the first aircraft can be calculated by multiplying 44 by 2. From this operation, we find that the first aircraft makes 88 flights daily.\n\n2. The problem states that the first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights. This means that one-fourth of its total flights are evenly divided between France and Germany.\n\n3. To find the flights made daily by the first aircraft to France, we need to calculate one-eighth (1/8) of the total 88 flights. We get one-eighth by dividing the one-fourth equally between France and Germany.\n\nLet's find the number of flights."
