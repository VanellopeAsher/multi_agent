Since there are 10 packages and each package contains 6 biscuits, Carl bought a total of 10 * 6 = 60 biscuits.\n2. Then, compute the total cost of these biscuits. Given that each biscuit is priced at $0.10, the total cost will be 60 * $0.10 = $6.00.\n3. Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount of money Carl handed over ($10.00) to find out how much change he will get back. This will be $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00. \n\nTherefore, Carl will receive $4.00 in change."
