We can use this information to calculate their current ages.\n\n   Let the ratio representative of their ages be `x`, such that `7x + 11x = 162`.\n\n2. Calculate the ratio representative `x = 162 / (7 + 11)`.\n\n3. With the value of `x`, it will be possible to calculate Allen's current age, which is `11x`.\n\n4. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, simply add 10 to his current age calculated in step 3.\n\nPlease be reminded that these are just steps and no mathematical operations have been done yet.
