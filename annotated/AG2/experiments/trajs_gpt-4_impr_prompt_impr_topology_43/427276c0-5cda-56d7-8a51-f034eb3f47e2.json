Identify and list down all the heights of the heels.\n2. Add all the heights together to get the total sum.\n3. Divide the total sum by the total number of heels to find the average height.\n\nGiven that there are three women with 4.5-inch heels and three with 2.5-inch heels, we can apply the three steps as follows:\n\n1. The list of all the heights is: [4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]\n2. The total sum is: (4.5 * 3) + (2.5 * 3)\n3. The average height is: total sum / 6 (since there are six women) \n\nLet's calculate the total sum and the average heel height."
