  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

The total weight of sugar cubes, which is 2 1-pound boxes that add up to 2 pounds.\n2. The total weight of the carrots, which is 4 12-pound bags, adding up to 48 pounds.\n3. The total weight of hay, which is 42 75-pound bales, therefore in total 3150 pounds.\n4. The total weight of oats, which is 20 65-pound sacks, thus adding up to 1300 pounds.\n\nNext, we total up these amounts, and then divide by the number of trips, 2, to determine the capacity of the farm truck per trip."

Therefore, the total weight of sugar cubes is a product of 2 (boxes) and 1 (pound per box).\n\n- Carrots: The farmer bought 4 bags, each bag weighs 12 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of carrots is a product of 4 (bags) and 12 (pounds per bag).\n\n- Hay: The farmer bought 42 bales, each bale weighs 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of hay is a product of 42 (bales) and 75 (pounds per bale).\n\n- Oats: The farmer bought 20 sacks, each sack weighs 65 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of oats is a product of 20 (sacks) and 65 (pounds per sack).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total weight of all feed items combined by summing up the weights of all types of feed. After getting the total weight, we divide it by the number of trips the farmer plans to take (which is 2) to determine the capacity of the truck per trip."

To be sure, let's confirm that all possible feed weights have been factored in for the solution proposed by both agents.\n\nBoth Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver appropriately addressed the problem values:\n\n1. Sugar cubes: 2 * 1-pound boxes = 2 pounds\n2. Carrots: 4 * 12-pound bags = 48 pounds\n3. Hay: 42 * 75-pound bales = 3,150 pounds\n4. Oats: 20 * 65-pound sacks = 1,300 pounds\n\nSumming these weights equals 4,500 pounds. When this is divided evenly across two trips, we obtain 2,250 pounds per trip. Therefore, the suggested solution of the truck being able to carry 2,250 pounds per trip is correct. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{2250}**."
