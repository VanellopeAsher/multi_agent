Calculate the total number of crayon fragments: \n   Since each container has 64 crayons and she has 3 containers, it will be 64 * 3.\n   \n2. Calculate the total number of crayon muffins: \n   Since she uses 8 fragments to make a crayon muffin, the total number of muffins she can make is total number of crayon fragments divided by 8 (since that's how many fragments each muffin needs).\n   \n3. Finally, calculate the earning:\n   Multiply the total number of muffin by the price of each muffin ($1.50) to get her earnings. \n\nLet's solve this now."
