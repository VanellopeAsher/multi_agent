Each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by each boy plus 4.5 times the number of shells brought by each boy.\n4. We need to find how many seashells were brought by each girl.\n\nFrom the information given, we can see that the number of shells brought by each girl is equal to (1+4.5)*number of shells brought by each boy = 5.5*number of shells brought by each boy.\n\nSo let's calculate this. Using the given that each boy brought 60 shells, the number of shells brought by each girl is 5.5 * 60."
