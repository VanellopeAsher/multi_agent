Identify the time John spends on each activity\n  - John spent 6 hours boating\n  - He spent half of the boating time swimming which is 6/2 = 3 hours\n  - Each show lasted 2 hours and he watched 3 shows. This totals 2*3 = 6 hours\n\n2. Calculate the total time spent on these activities\n  - The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3(swimming) + 6(shows) = 15 hours\n\n3. From the problem, we know that the time spent on these activities was 30% of the total time. We can denote the total time as T. We then have the equation:\n  - 0.30T = 15\n\n4. Solve the equation to find the total time\n  - T = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours\n\n5. The total time spent sightseeing can then be found by subtracting the time spent on other activities from the total time \n  - Time spent sightseeing = T - (boating + swimming + shows)\n  - = 50 - (6 + 3 + 6)\n  - = 50 - 15\n  - = 35 hours\n\nSo, John spent 35 hours sightseeing."
