For one dose, she uses 'x' mL + '3x' mL, which equals to '4x' mL of medicine in total.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Saanvi prepared 8 doses of medicine using 448 mL in total. So, '4x' mL (the amount per dose) times '8' doses is equal to '448' mL.\n\nWe can write the equation 4x * 8 = 448, simplify it and then solve for 'x' to find out the amount that Saanvi used of the first medicine per dose."

Here, I will solve it using native Python functionalities.\n\n```python\n# The total amount of medicine combined for 8 doses\ntotal_medicine_volume = 448  \n\n# The number of doses prepared\ndoses = 8  \n\n# Since the amount of medicine combined for a single dose is 4x (where 'x' is the amount of the first medicine), \n# We can figure out 'x' by dividing the total volume by 4*doses.\nmedicine_1_per_dose = total_medicine_volume / (4 * doses)  \n\nprint(medicine_1_per_dose)\n```\n\nThe output will be the amount of the first medicine used per dose."
