      "content": "To solve this problem, we will take the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the points for Bella: If Bella collected 30% more points than Alex, we need to calculate this number. We know that Alex has 60 points. 30% of 60 is 18, so Bella has got 60 + 18 = 78 points.\n\n2. Determine the points for Tim: From the problem, we know that Tim has got 40 points less than Bella. So Tim's points are 78 - 40 = 38 points.\n\n3. Assess the points for Mary: We are told that Mary managed to collect three times more points than Tim. Therefore, Mary's points are 3 * 38 = 114 points.\n\n4. Sum up total points: To get the total points collected by the class, we add the points of Alex, Bella, Tim, and Mary. So, Total points = 60 (Alex) + 78 (Bella) + 38 (Tim) + 114 (Mary) = 290 points.\n\n5. Calculate points needed for field trip: Finally, to find out how many points the class needs to reach the threshold for the trip (500), we subtract the total points they've already accumulated from the threshold. So, Points needed = 500 - 290 = 210 points. \n\nHence, Class 3B needs 210 more points to go on a field trip."

Class 3B needs an additional 210 points to meet the requirement for the field trip. Both agents computed Bella's points correctly as 60 * 1.3 = 78 points. They also correctly determined Tim's points to be 78 - 40 = 38 points. Mary's points were calculated correctly as 3 * 38 = 114 points. Adding together the points collected by Alex, Bella, Tim, and Mary, the total came to 290 points. To find the total points short, they rightfully subtracted the total collected points from the minimum threshold for the field trip: 500 - 290 = 210. Therefore, I confirm that the solution is right, and the class lacks 210 additional points to go on a field trip. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{210}."
