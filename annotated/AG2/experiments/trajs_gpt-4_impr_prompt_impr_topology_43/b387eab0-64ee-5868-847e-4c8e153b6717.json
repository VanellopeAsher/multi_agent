Calculate the amount spent before rebates: This is done by multiplying the gas price per gallon by the number of gallons bought. In this case, it is $3.00 * 10.\n2. Calculate the cashback from the app: Multiply the amount the app is offering per gallon by the number of gallons purchased. So it would be $.20 * 10.\n3. Deduct the cashback from the total amount spent to get the amount with cashback considered.\n4. After deducting, apply the coupon on the total (which is a 10% discount). To find this, we need to take 10% (0.10) of the amount from step 3.\n5. Finally, subtract this coupon value from the amount from step 3 to find the final amount spent. \n\nThis process breaks the problem down into simple algebraic calculations."
