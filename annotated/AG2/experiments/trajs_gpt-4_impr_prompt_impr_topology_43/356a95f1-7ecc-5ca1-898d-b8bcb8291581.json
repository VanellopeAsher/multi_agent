If we add the length of the fences for Sam and Harry, we should get 200 feet, which can be represented as:\nS + H = 200     ------  equation (2)\n\nNow we have 2 equations (1 and 2). We can substitute equation (1) into equation (2) to solve for 'S' (the length of the fence for Sam).\n\nOnce we know 'S', we can substitute it back into equation (1) to get the length of fence for Harry."
