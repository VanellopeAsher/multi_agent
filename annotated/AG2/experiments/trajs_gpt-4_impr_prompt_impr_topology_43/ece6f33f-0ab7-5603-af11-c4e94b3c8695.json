Since they are 5 in total and they split the amount evenly, we can divide $100 by 5.\n\n2. Once we found out how much each person contributes monthly, we need to find out their annual contribution. Given that there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply the monthly contribution with 12 to get the annual contribution. \n\nLet's calculate these steps."

The agents carried out the correct calculations based on the provided problem's details. There were no assumptions made. The solution provided by the agents involved dividing the total monthly cost by the number of roommates to ascertain the monthly contribution, then multiplying the monthly payment by 12 to get the annual contribution. The calculations are correct.\n\nAs a result, I can conclude that each roommate contributes $240 annually to cover the electricity bill. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{240}**"
