So our new simplified ratio is 1 potato : 6 hash browns.\n\nStep 3: Apply the simplified ratio to the number of potatoes in the question.\n        \n        If 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, then 960 potatoes will make 960 * 6 = 5760 hash browns.\n\nSo, you can make 5760 hash browns out of 960 potatoes. \n\nDoes my solution align with that of Agent_Code_Executor?"
