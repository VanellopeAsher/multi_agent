      "content": "Here are the steps I'd suggest to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to determine the cost per class if Manny attends all classes. This is done by dividing the total amount paid ($80) by the total number of classes (12). This will give us the cost per class.\n\n2. Next, we compare this cost per class with the maximum amount his parents are willing to pay per class. If the cost per class is more than $20, then Manny cannot miss any classes.\n\n3. However, if the cost per class is less than or equal to $20, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class will not exceed $20. We do that by dividing the total amount paid ($80) by $20 to get the minimum number of classes that Manny needs to attend. We then subtract this number from the total number of classes to get the maximum number of classes that Manny can miss.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\nStep 1: \n    Manny's parents have paid $80 for 12 classes. \n    So, cost per class = $80 / 12 = $6.67 (approximately)\n\nSteps 2 and 3:\n    The cost per class is less than $20. Hence, we proceed to step 3. \n    We first calculate the minimum number of classes Manny needs to attend to keep the cost per class under $20.\n    Minimum classes = $80 / $20 = 4\n    Hence, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is 12 (total classes) - 4 (minimum classes he needs to attend) = 8\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss up to 8 classes before his classes cost more than $20 each. \n\nLet's check if these calculations are correct."
