According to the problem, the first tree is 60 feet tall, and the second tree is 50 feet taller than the first tree. Hence, the second tree's height is 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet.\n2. Add the heights of the first two trees to get the combined height. From step 1, we add 60 feet (first tree) + 110 feet (second tree) = 170 feet.\n3. From the problem, the height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the first two trees. Hence, we multiply the combined height obtained in step 2 by 2. \n   Thus, the tallest tree's height is 170 feet * 2 = 340 feet."
