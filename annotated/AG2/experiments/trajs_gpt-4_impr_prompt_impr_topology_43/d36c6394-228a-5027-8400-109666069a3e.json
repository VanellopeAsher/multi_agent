Subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop - 8. Resulting in 48 - 8 = 40.\n3. Add the number of people who got on at the first stop, which is 5 times the number who got off, or 5 * 8 = 40. Add this to the result of step 2, resulting in 40 + 40 = 80.\n4. Subtract the 2 people who decide to get off before the bus departs. We now have 80 - 2 = 78.\n5. At the second stop, subtract the 21 passengers who get off. We now have 78 - 21 = 57.\n6. Finally, add the number of people who got on at the second stop, which is a third of the number who got off, or 21 / 3 = 7. Add this to the result of step 5, we now have 57 + 7 = 64. Therefore, there are 64 passengers riding the bus after the second stop."
