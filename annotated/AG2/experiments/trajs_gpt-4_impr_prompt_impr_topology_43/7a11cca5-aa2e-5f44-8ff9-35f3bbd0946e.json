After a day of heavy rain, this volume doubles - meaning it becomes 4000 x 2 = 8000 gallons.  \nThe total amount of water passing through the river on the third day becomes 14000 gallons. So we need to find the increase on the third day. \n\nStep 2: From the values, we can find the increase in water on the third day by subtracting the amount on the second day from that on the third day.  \nThis implies that,   \nIncrease on the third day = (Total amount on the third day) - (Total amount on the second day)    \n                        = 14000 - 8000  \n                        = 6000 gallons. \n\nSo, the increase in water amount on the third day from the second day is 6000 gallons.\n  \nI will now like to communicate with the others to hear their opinions and findings."
