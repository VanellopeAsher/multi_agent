If he works daily, this is simply the product of 'd' (the number of doughnuts made per day) and 'j' (the number of days worked in June).\n  - Multiply the total number of doughnuts sold in June by the price per doughnut ($2) to calculate the total amount of money made in June.\n  \nRemember, 'd' and 'j' need to be provided or assumed to compute the exact amount."

To calculate the total amount of money made by Derrick in June by selling doughnuts, we require two essential pieces of information not provided in the problem - the number of doughnuts made daily (d) and the number of days Derrick operates his bakery in June (j).\n   \n2. Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor suggested accordingly a calculation method, which multiplies the number of doughnuts made daily (d), the number of working days in June (j), and the price per doughnut ($2) for the total amount. They both stressed that without the specifics for 'd' and 'j', an actual calculation cannot be made.\n   \n3. Agent Code Executor provided example code for this calculation, which can be utilized once 'd' and 'j' are known.\n\n4. The lack of detailed information hinders the execution and validation of the solution at this moment. If these figures are obtained, the problem can be resolved rapidly using the suggested approach. \n\nWe look forward to receiving the needed data to assist Derrick in determining his potential earnings from doughnut sales in June."
