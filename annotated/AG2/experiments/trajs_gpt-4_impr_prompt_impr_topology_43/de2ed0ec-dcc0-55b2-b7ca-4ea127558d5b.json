      "content": "Given the information in the problem, we can use the relationships between the heights of the children to work backwards and find the height of the first child.\n\nHere is my step-by-step solution:\n\nStep 1: Convert the height of the fourth child from inches to feet. \nGiven that there are 12 inches in one foot, the fourth child is 72 / 12 = 6 feet tall.\n\nStep 2: Find the height of the third child. \nSince the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, we subtract 3 inches from the height of the fourth child. Since we are working with feet and inches, we need to convert the 3 inches into feet. This gives us 3 / 12 = 0.25 feet. Therefore, the third child is 6 - 0.25 = 5.75 feet tall.\n\nStep 3: Find the height of the second child. \nThe third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we add 5 inches to the height of the third child. Converting the 5 inches into feet gives us 5 / 12 = 0.41 (rounded to two decimal places) feet. So, the second child is 5.75 + 0.41 = 6.16 feet tall.\n\nStep 4: Find the height of the first child. \nThe first child is 2 inches shorter than the second child. We subtract 2 inches, converted to feet (2/12 = 0.16 feet), from the height of the second child. This gives us 6.16 - 0.16 = 6 feet. \n\nSo, Caroline's first child is 6 feet tall."
