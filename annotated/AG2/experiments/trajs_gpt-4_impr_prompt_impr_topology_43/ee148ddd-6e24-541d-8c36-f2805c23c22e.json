      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out what percent of Johnâ€™s time accounted for all the activities he engaged in. Here's how I would go about this:\n\n1. First, determine the time John spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows.\n    - Boating time is given as 6 hours.\n    - Swimming time is half the boating time, therefore 6 / 2 = 3 hours.\n    - He watched 3 shows, each lasting for 2 hours, therefore the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.\n\n2. Next, calculate the total time spent on these activities.\n   - Total time for boating, swimming and watching shows is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours.\n\n3. Since the time spent on these activities is given as 30% of the total time, you can calculate the total time.\n   - If 30% of the total time equals 15 hours, 100% equals 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours.\n\n4. It's given that 40% of the total time is spent sightseeing.\n   - 40% of 50 hours equals 0.40 * 50 = 20 hours.\n\nSo, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."

Finally, we find 40% of that total time to get the hours John spent sightseeing.\n\nHere is the Python code for the solution."
