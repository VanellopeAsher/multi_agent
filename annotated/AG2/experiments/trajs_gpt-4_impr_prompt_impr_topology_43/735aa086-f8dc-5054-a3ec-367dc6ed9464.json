  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

Carrots: 40 bags * 120 pounds/bag = 4800 pounds\n3. Hay: 420 bales * 750 pounds/bale = 315000 pounds\n4. Oats: 200 sacks * 650 pounds/sack = 130000 pounds\n\nThen, we add up the total weight of all the feeds: 200 pounds + 4800 pounds + 315000 pounds + 130000 pounds = 450000 pounds.\n\nThe last step is to calculate the number of trips. Because the truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, we divide the total weight of the feeds by the capacity of the truck: 450000 pounds / 22500 pounds/trip = 20 trips.\n\nBut since trips can't be fractions, we will need to round up to account for any weight that is above a multiple of the truck's capacity. The farmer can't make part of a trip, so he will need to make 21 trips in total."

Total weight of feed = 450000 pounds.\n2. Truck capacity = 22500 pounds.\n\nNow, 450000 divided by 22500 equals exactly 20, with no residual fraction, implying that the total weight is a perfect multiple of the truck's capacity. \n\nGiven that trips must be whole numbers, and we have an exact division between the total weight and the truck's capacity, I can confirm that there is no residual weight that would warrant an additional trip. \n\nTherefore, Agent_Code_Executor's solution is correct, and the farmer will need exactly 20 trips to transport all the feed."
