However, on Monday, the teacher had to conduct an extra class for his students who needed additional help. As a result, he ended up using 45% of the chalk, which was 1.5 times more than his usual consumption. He also noticed that the chalk weighed 0.5 ounces, but this didn't affect his usage.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll take the following steps:\n\n1. We are given that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk on a typical day, but he used 45% on Monday.\n2. Therefore, we can calculate that the total remaining length of the chalk after Monday is 55% because 100% (the starting percentage) - 45% (the percentage used on Monday) = 55%.\n3. Next, let's convert this percentage back into inches to determine how many inches of chalk the teacher has left. We know that the original length of the chalk was 5 inches, so 55% of 5 inches is 2.75 inches.\n4. The teacher cannot write with a chalk shorter than 2 inches. Therefore, he can only continue to use the chalk until it becomes shorter than 2 inches.\n5. Each day, the teacher plans to use 20% of the original chalk length, which is 1 inch (because 20% of 5 inches is 1 inch).\n6. Therefore, after Tuesday, the chalk will be 1.75 inches long (because 2.75 inches - 1 inch = 1.75 inches).\n7. After Wednesday, the chalk will be 0.75 inches long (because 1.75 inches - 1 inch = 0.75 inches). At this point, the length of the chalk is less than 2 inches, so the teacher won't be able to use it any further.\n8. The teacher can therefore write with this piece of chalk for a total of 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) before he needs to recycle it."
