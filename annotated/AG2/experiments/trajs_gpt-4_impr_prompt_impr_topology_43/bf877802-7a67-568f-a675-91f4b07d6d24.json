It increases by 5 degrees each hour for 10 hours. So, the change in angle over this period is 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees. Hence, at the end of the 10 hours, from the ground to the sun would be the initial angle of the pyramid plus this change, which is 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.\n\nPhase 2: The sun starts moving at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours.\nAgain, the increase in angle will be 3 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 6 degrees. So, after these two additional hours, the total angle from the ground to the sun would be 82 degrees + 6 degrees = 88 degrees.\n\nOverall, my solution suggests that there will be 88 degrees from the ground to the sun after the entire 12-hour period according to the rates given."

Even though it was not explicitly stated in the problem, it was understood that the rates given were constant over the specified periods. It would be more complicated if the rate at which the sun moved was changing over time, not constant. \n\nAlso, it's worth noting that this solution assumes a simplified model where the rates given completely control the angle of the sun. In reality, factors like the rotation of the Earth around its axis and its revolution around the sun would make this a much more complex problem.\n\nNonetheless, I believe we have confidently solved the problem with the given conditions.
