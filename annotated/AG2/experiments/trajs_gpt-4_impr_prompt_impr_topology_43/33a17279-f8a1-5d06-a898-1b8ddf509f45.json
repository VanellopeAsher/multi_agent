Calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes, respectively:\n    - For the cookies, she sold 80 cookies for $1 each amounting to 80*1 = $80\n    - For the cupcakes, she sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each amounting to 60*4 = $240\n  \n2. Add these two totals to get her total earnings: $80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320\n\n3. Subtract the amount she gave to her sisters and the local charity from her total earnings:\n   - She gave a total of 2*$10 (two sisters, $10 each) = $20 to her sisters\n   - She donated $15 to a local charity\n   - Therefore, she gave away a total of $20 (to sisters) + $15 (to charity) = $35\n\n4. Subtract the $35 she gave away from her total earnings of $320 to find out how much she has left. $320 - $35 = $285.\n\nSo, Suzanne has $285 left from her earnings."

The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula -b/2a.\n\nHowever, since the parabola opens upwards (since a is positive), this function does not have a maximum value. The function continues to increase as x moves away from the vertex in either direction. The function does have a minimum, given by the y-coordinate of the vertex (f(-b/2a)), but you asked for the maximum. \n\nCould you please confirm if you meant to ask for the minimum or if the function should have been different to have a maximum?"

Instead, it has a minimum value which is found at the vertex of the parabola.\n\nYou correctly mentioned that the x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula -b/2a. If the original question indeed meant to ask for the minimum value, we can easily find it by substituting the x-coordinate of the vertex into the function. For this case, a=1, b=-4, so -b/2a = 4/2 = 2. Substituting x=2 into the function gives the minimum value.\n\nIn case the original question intended a function that does have a maximum, the squared term's coefficient would need to be negative to make the parabola open downwards. So the function might be -x^2 - 4x - 21 or something similar. But I don't want to jump to conclusions without further information. Could you clarify the original question?"

Instead, it has a minimum value.\n\nI think there might be some misunderstanding. If the original question was asking for the maximum value of this function, the question is flawed because this function does not have a maximum value. However, if the question was asking for the minimum value, we could proceed with the -b/2a formula you both mentioned. But let's go step by step.\n\nWe need to clarify if:\n1. The original problem question mistakenly asked for the maximum value instead of the minimum value, or\n2. The function provided in the problem was incorrect and it should have been a parabola that opens downwards (thus having a maximum value), as you suggested, Agent Code Executor.\n\nI suggest waiting for further clarification on these points before proceeding with a solution."
