      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much time John spent swimming. We know that he spent half the time he spent boating on swimming. Hence, the time spent swimming is 6.6 hours / 2 = 3.3 hours.\n\n2. Calculate the total time John spent watching shows. We know that each show lasted 2.5 hours and he watched 3 shows, so the total time spent on shows was 2.5 hours/show * 3 shows = 7.5 hours.\n\n3. Add the time John spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows to find total time he spent on these activities: 6.6 hours (boating) + 3.3 hours (swimming) + 7.5 hours (shows) = 17.4 hours.\n\n4. Since we know that these activities took up 30% of his total time, let's now figure out how much time John spent in total. We can find this by taking the time spent on these activities and divide by 0.3 (because it represents 30%), so total time = 17.4 hours / 0.3 = 58 hours.\n\n5. Finally we can calculate the time John spent sightseeing. We know that he spent 40% (or 0.4 of his total time), so the time spent sightseeing would be = 58 hours * 40% = 23.2 hours. \n\nThus, John spent 23.2 hours sightseeing."

The total time he spent on these activities is 6.6 hours (boating) + 3.3 hours (swimming) + 7.5 hours (shows) = 17.4 hours. As this is 30%, the total time spent on vacation is 17.4 hours / 0.3 = 58 hours approximately.\n5.
