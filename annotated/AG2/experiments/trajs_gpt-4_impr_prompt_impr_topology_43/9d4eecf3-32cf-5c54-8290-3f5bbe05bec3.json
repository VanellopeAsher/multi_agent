So, Richard has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 cherries.\n\n2. Now, we know that both Robert and Richard cherries combined, which is 3000 + 2000 = 5000 cherries.\n\n3. Since the total number of cherries to be shared is 6000, the remaining cherries must belong to Jerry, so Jerry has 6000 - 5000 = 1000 cherries.\n\n4. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, subtract Jerry's total from Robert's. So, Robert has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 more cherries than Jerry."

The conclusion is therefore that Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry. \n\nThe steps followed were to first determine how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 1000 from Robert's total. Then, subtracting the sum of Richard's and Robert's totals from the total number of cherries gave Jerry's total. The difference between Robert's total and Jerry's total gave the final answer: Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry. \n\nTherefore, the final solution is correct. Agent Code Executor's Python code, which followed similar steps, also ran successfully and returned the expected output. Excellent work."
