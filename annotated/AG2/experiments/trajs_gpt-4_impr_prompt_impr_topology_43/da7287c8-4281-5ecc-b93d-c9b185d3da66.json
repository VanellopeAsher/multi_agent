Calculate the total money made by selling milkshakes. This can be done by multiplying the number of milkshakes (6) with the selling price of each milkshake ($5.5).\n2. Calculate the total money made by selling burger platters by multiplying the number of burger platters (9) with the selling price of each platter ($11.5).\n3. Calculate the total money made by selling sodas. However, keep in mind that Terry only sells half of the 40 sodas. which means 20 sodas. Multiply this with the selling price of each soda ($1.5).\n4. Finally, add up all the money made from selling each item.\n\nLet's do the calculations for each step. \n\n1. Total money made from milkshakes = 6 * 5.5 = $33\n2. Total money made from burger platters = 9 * 11.5 = $103.5\n3. Total money made from sodas = (40/2) * 1.5 = $30\n4. Total money made = Total from milkshakes + total from burger platters + total from sodas = $33 + $103.5 + $30 = $166.5\n\nSo Terry makes a total of $166.5."

Based on both the problem solving steps and the executed Python code, we can confirm that Terry makes a total of $166.5 from selling the milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.
