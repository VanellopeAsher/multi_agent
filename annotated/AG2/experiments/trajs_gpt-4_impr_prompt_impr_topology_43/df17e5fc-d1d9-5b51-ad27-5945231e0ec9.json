So, 50% of the total 12 pints is for yellow paint, which is 6 pints (as 50/100 * 12 = 6).\n\n2. The remaining 50% of the mural is divided equally between red, white, and purple paint. This is 6 pints (50% of 12 pints).\n\n3. As red, white, and purple are equal portions of the remaining, therefore each get a 1/3 share of the remaining paint. Hence the quantity of red paint is 1/3 of 6 pints, which equals 2 pints. \n\nSo, 2 pints of red paint were used for the mural."
