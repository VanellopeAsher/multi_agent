      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of product sold each day, multiply that by their respective prices, and then sum the totals. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Determine the number of apple pies sold on Saturday. Given that Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and on Sunday he sold 15 boxes, therefore on Saturday he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes.\n2. Calculate the total number of apple pies sold. Given that Sunny sold 4 apple pies on Monday, the total number of apple pies sold is therefore 15 from Sunday + 11 from Saturday + 4 from Monday = 30 boxes.\n3. Multiply the number of apple pies sold by the cost of one apple pie to find how much Sunny earned from selling apple pies. Since one apple pie sells for $15, Sunny earned 15 * 30 = $450 from selling apple pies.\n4. Determine the number of gingerbread sold on Sunday. Given that Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday, and we know he sold 10 boxes on Saturday, therefore on Sunday he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.\n5. Calculate the total number of gingerbread sold. Given that Sunny sold 2 gingerbread on Monday, the total number of gingerbread sold is therefore 10 from Saturday + 15 from Sunday + 2 from Monday = 27 boxes.\n6. Multiply the number of gingerbread sold by the cost of one gingerbread to find how much Sunny earned from selling gingerbread. Since one gingerbread sells for $6, Sunny earned 6 * 27 = $162 from selling gingerbread.\n7. Calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned. By adding the total earnings from selling apple pies and gingerbread, Sunny earned $450 + $162 = $612 over the three days."
