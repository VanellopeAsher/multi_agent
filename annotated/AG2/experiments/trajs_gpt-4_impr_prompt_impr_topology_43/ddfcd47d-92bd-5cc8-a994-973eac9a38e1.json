Since Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $150, we can calculate the amount of money Kassidy has by multiplying the amount Aurelia has ($150) by 2/3.\n\n2. Rayna has $70 more than Kassidy, so to find out how much money Rayna has, we add $70 to the amount of money we previously calculated for Kassidy.\n\n3. The total amount of money the three have is the sum of the amount each person has. We can calculate this by adding together the amounts we calculated for Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia.\n\n4. If they decide to share their total money equally among them, each would have 1/3 of the total amount. Hence, we divide the total sum we got from step 3 by 3. \n\nAfter the calculation, each of them would have the same amount of money."
