To find the total of red, blue, and green squares is 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) = 56.\n\n3. The total number of squares on Brittany's comforter is 68. So, the number of white squares is 68 (total squares) - 56 (red, blue, and green) = 12.\n\n4. To calculate how much fewer white squares than green squares, subtract the number of white squares from green squares. which is 24 (green) - 12 (white) = 12. \n\nSo, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares."
