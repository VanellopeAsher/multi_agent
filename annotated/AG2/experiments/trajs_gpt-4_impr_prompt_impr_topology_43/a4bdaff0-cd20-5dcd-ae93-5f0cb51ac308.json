This is equal to the sum of the student loan minimum payment, credit card minimum payment, and mortgage minimum payment.\n2. Calculate the amount Jessica wants to pay, which is 50% more than the required minimum monthly payment. To find this, multiply the monthly minimum requirement by 50%, then add this amount to the total minimum monthly payment.\n3. To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, multiply the monthly amount from step 2 by 12. \n\nAfter these steps, we will get the amount Jessica pays in a year."

Then compute the monthly total Jessica willing to pay by adding 50% of the total monthly minimum amount to the total monthly minimum amount. \n\nAfter calculating the amount payable per month, the total amount payable in a year would be the monthly payable amount multiplied by a year's 12 months.\n\nLet's go ahead with the computation."
