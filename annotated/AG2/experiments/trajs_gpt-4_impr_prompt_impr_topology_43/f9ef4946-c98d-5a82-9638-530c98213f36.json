On Monday and Tuesday, he watches an hour-long episode each day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 2*1 = 2 hours.\n2. On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. So he spent 3*0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n3. On Thursday, he watched an hour of episodes and an additional 30-minute show. So he spent 1+0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n4. On Friday, he watched two one-hour episodes. So he spent 2*1 = 2 hours.\n\nAfter calculating the hours he spent watching TV each day, we add those hours to find the total. The total is 2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7 hours. So, Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total."
