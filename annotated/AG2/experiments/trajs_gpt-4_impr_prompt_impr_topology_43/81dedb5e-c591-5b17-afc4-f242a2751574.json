Let's denote the total length as L. The length of each of the first cuts would be L/4.\n\nStep 2: Each of the resulting pieces is further divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of the final cuts, divide the length of the first cuts (L/4) by 5. The final length will therefore be L/(4*5), which simplifies to L/20.\n\nSo each final cut will be 1/20th of the total length of the ribbon."
