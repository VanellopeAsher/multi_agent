We are given that some boys and 22 girls are playing soccer; however, we do not know the exact total figure of students playing soccer.\n\nTherefore, without the total number of students playing soccer, it isn't possible to determine the total number of students overall. \n\nWe can only know that at least 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 22 (girls in soccer) = 40 students are there.
