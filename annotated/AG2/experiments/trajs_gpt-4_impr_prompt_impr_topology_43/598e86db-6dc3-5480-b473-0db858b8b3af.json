First, we calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th inclusive, which is 31 days in March and 19 days in April - total 50 days.\n\n2. We then identify 20% of these days that Billy takes off. That gives us 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.\n\n3. Billy is working for the remaining 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. Billy works for 3 hours a day, so in total, he works for 40 * 3 = 120 hours.\n\n5. If he helped 240 people in total, the number of people he helps per hour would be 240 / 120 = 2 people per hour.\n"
