According to the problem, \"Carver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.\" So the equation is: 2x - 8 = 60.\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation. To isolate variable x, add 8 to both sides of the equation and then divide both sides by 2.\n\nBy these steps, we can find the son's age."
