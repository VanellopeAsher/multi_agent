This involves multiplying quantities by their respective costs and adding them.\n\n    Ingredient costs per jar:\n    Passion fruit = 2 lbs * $6/lb = $12\n    Jackfruit = 1.5 lbs * $8/lb = $12\n    Honey = 2 lbs * $10/lb = $20\n\n    Total cost per jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44\n\nStep 2: Multiply the cost per jar by the number of jars sold (10 in this case) to get the total ingredient cost for those jars. Hence, \n\n    Total ingredient cost= $44 * 10 = $440\n\nStep 3: Calculate sales revenue by multiplying the sales price per jar ($50) by the number of jars sold (10). Hence, \n\n    Total revenue = $50 * 10 = $500\n\nStep 4: Find the profit (revenue - cost). Hence, \n\n    Profit = $500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60\n\nSo, Tim makes a profit of $60 by selling 10 jars of his special mixture."
