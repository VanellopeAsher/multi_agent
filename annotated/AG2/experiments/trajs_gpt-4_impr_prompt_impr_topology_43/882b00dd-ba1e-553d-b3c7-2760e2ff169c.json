Calculate the total money that Billy makes in 20 hours.\n4. Calculate the total money that Sally makes in 20 hours.\n5. Find the difference between Billy's and Sally's earnings.\n\nStep-by-step execution:\n\n1. Billy's initial hourly rate was $10. Two months later, it was raised by $0.50 to $10.50. On his first work anniversary, it was raised by another $1.00 to $11.50.\n2. Sally's starting hourly rate was $0.50 more than Billy's, so it was $10.50. After two months, she received a raise of $0.50, making her hourly rate $11.00.\n3. Billy makes $11.50 * 20 = $230 in 20 hours.\n4. Sally makes $11.00 * 20 = $220 in 20 hours.\n5. Billy makes $230 - $220 = $10 more than Sally for 20 hours' work."

However, based on my analysis and manual execution, I can conclude that the Python code carries out the steps correctly:\n\n1. It first calculates Billy's final wage by adding Billy's initial wage and his raises.\n2. Then, it calculates Sally's final wage by adding her initial wage (which is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage) and her raise.\n3. It calculates the earnings of Billy and Sally for 20 hours by multiplying their respective final hourly wages by 20.\n4. Finally, it calculates the difference between Billy's and Sally's earnings, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nTherefore, both agents' solutions are correct and I concur with their results. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10}."
