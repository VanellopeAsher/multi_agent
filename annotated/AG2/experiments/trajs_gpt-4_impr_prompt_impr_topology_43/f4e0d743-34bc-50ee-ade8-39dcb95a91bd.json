      "content": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Compute the total cost of the food for a year. This requires multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year, which is $25 * 4 weeks/month * 12 months/year = $1200.\n   \n2. The cost for treats in a year is easy to compute: simply multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year, which is $20/month * 12 months/year = $240.\n   \n3. Do the same for the medicine cost: $100/month * 12 months/year = $1200.\n   \n4. We also repeat this process for the shampoo cost. We multiply the monthly shampoo cost by the number of months in a year, which is $15/month * 12 months/year = $180.\n   \n5. The toy is bought every two months. So, we multiply the toy cost by the number of two-month periods in a year: that is $10/two-month * 6 two-month periods/year = $60.\n   \n6. After calculating the annual cost of each item, add them all together to get the total cost Madeline spends on her dog per year: $1200 (food) + $240 (treats) + $1200 (medicine) + $180 (shampoo) + $60 (toy) = $2880.\n\nSo, my answer is that Madeline spends $2880 on her dog each year."
