Afterward, we will find the number of packets of tomato seeds by dividing the amount used to buy tomato seeds by the cost of one packet of tomato seeds. \n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Since a packet of celery seeds costs $30 and Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets, the total cost of celery seeds is $30 * 80 = $2400.\n2. Mrs. Rylan spent $3200 in total. Therefore, the money she used to buy tomato seeds is $3200 - $2400 = $800.\n3. We know each packet of tomato seeds costs $40. Therefore, the number of Tomato seed packets she bought is $800 / $40 = 20 packets. \n\nTherefore, Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds."
