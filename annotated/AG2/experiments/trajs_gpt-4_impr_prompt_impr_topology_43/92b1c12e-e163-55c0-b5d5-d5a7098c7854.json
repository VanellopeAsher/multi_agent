The three equations given are as follows:\n\nLet's denote:\n\nC = Carver's age \n\nD = Daughter's age \n\nS = Son's age\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1. C = 45 (Carver's age is known to be 45 years old)\n\n2. C = 2D - 5 (Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter)\n\n3. D = 3S + 4 (His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations as follows:\n\n- Since C = 45, from equation (2), we can express D (daughter's age) in terms of C:\n  D = (C + 5) / 2\n  Substitute C = 45 into the equation to find D.\n\n- Once D is found, substitute its value into equation (3) to find S (son's age). \n\nLet's solve the equations."
