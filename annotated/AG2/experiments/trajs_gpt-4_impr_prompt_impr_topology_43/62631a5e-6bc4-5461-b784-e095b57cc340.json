Collins got 150 more corn chips than the number the others got, which means Collins got 700 + 150 = 850 corn chips.\n3. The total number of corn chips is, therefore, the 1400 from Amora and Lainey plus the 850 that Collins got, which is 1400 + 850 = 2250 corn chips.\n\nTherefore, there were 2250 corn chips altogether."
