      "content": "First, let's calculate how many cards Miss Maria has in total.\n\nShe has six decks of basketball cards, with 25 cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25.\n\nShe also has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40.\n\nWe add these two figures up to get the total number of cards Miss Maria has.\n\nMiss Maria gave her sister 10 cards, but Jane refused them, so Maria still has those cards.\n\nShe then keeps 50 cards for herself and gives the rest to her students.\n\nFinally, we need to know that each student received ten cards. By dividing the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student received, we can find out how many students there are.\n\nTo break this down into steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = total basketball cards.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = total baseball cards.\n3. Compute the total number of cards: total basketball cards + total baseball cards = total cards.\n4. Deduct the number of cards Miss Maria keeps for herself: total cards - 50 (cards Miss Maria keeps) = cards for students.\n5. Find out the number of students: cards for students / 10 (number of cards each student got) = number of students.\n\nSo that's how you solve this problem step by step."

Here's a summarised version of the solution.\n\nMiss Maria has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, totaling to 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards. She also has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, equating to 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. This gives her a sum of 150 + 200 = 350 cards.\n\nShe keeps 50 of these cards for herself, distributing the remaining 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students. Since each student received ten cards, we conclude that she has 300 / 10 = 30 students.\n\nIn conclusion, Miss Maria has 30 students. Both agents' contributions were integral to arriving at this solution."
