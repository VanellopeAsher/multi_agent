Jackson buys 2.4 times of ten blue tulips. 2.4 * 10 = 24 blue tulips\n3. Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So number of rows required for red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6 rows\n4. Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So number of rows required for blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3 rows\n5. Total rows of flowers that Jackson will plant is the sum of red tulip rows and blue tulip rows which equals 6 + 3 = 9 rows\n\nHence, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."

      "content": "Allow me to code this solution for us.\n\nFirstly, we calculate the number of red tulips and blue tulips Jackson buys. Since he buys 3.6 times of ten red tulips, the total number of red tulips equal to 3.6 * 10 = 36. Similarly, since he buys 2.4 times of ten blue tulips, the total number of blue tulips would equal 2.4 * 10 = 24.\n\nNext, we calculate the total rows of red tulips and blue tulips he can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row, the total rows of red tulips equals the total number of red tulips divided by 6. Likewise, since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, the total rows of blue tulips equals the total number of blue tulips divided by 8.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of rows of flowers. This is simply the sum of the total rows of red tulips and blue tulips. Let's execute this in Python."

When executed, the Python algorithm calculates the total rows of red and blue tulips accordingly and adds them together to get the total number of rows Jackson will plant. So according to the calculation, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."
