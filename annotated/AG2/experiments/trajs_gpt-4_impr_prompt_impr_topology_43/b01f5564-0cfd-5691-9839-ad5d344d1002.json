Given that 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein in 300 grams by ratio.\n2. After finding out how much protein there is in 300 grams of mushrooms, we need to figure out how much protein John gets in a week. As there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7.\n\nLet's calculate."

Given the proportion that 150 grams of mushrooms contains 4 grams of protein, we can set up a ratio to solve for the unknown quantity of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n\nOnce we have determined the daily protein intake, we can then find the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily protein consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). Let's do the calculations.\n\n```python\n# given data\ngrams_of_protein_in_150g = 4\ngrams_of_mushrooms_john_eats_daily = 300\ndays_in_a_week = 7\n\n# find the ratio of protein in the mushrooms\nprotein_per_gram = grams_of_protein_in_150g / 150\n\n# find the total daily protein John consumed\ndaily_protein_john_eats = protein_per_gram * grams_of_mushrooms_john_eats_daily\n\n# find the total weekly protein John consumed\nweekly_protein_john_eats = daily_protein_john_eats * days_in_a_week\n\nprint(f\"John consumes {weekly_protein_john_eats} grams of protein by eating mushrooms every week.\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.

Agent Problem Solver explains that the problem can be solved by finding out how much protein there is in a 300g serving of mushrooms and then multiplying that amount by the number of days in a week. Agent Code Executor has executed the python code based on the solution proposed by Agent Problem Solver and the output shows that John consumes 56.0 grams of protein by eating mushrooms every week.\n\nBoth solutions align with each other and correctly use the values given in the problem's description to solve the task. There aren't any conflicting solutions or discrepancies in their proposed solutions, and no additional assumptions have been made.
