      "content": "First, let's break down the problem.\n\nStep 1: Determine how long it takes for one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, they can paint a whole house in 10 days.\n\nStep 2: Now that we know it takes one person 10 days to paint a house, we need to find out how long it would take a team of 5 people to paint the house. Since they're working together, we divide the total time it takes one person to paint the house by the number of people. So 10 days divided by 5 people equals 2 days.\n\nStep 3: Convert days into hours. Since one day is 24 hours, we multiply the number of days by 24. So 2 days times 24 hours equals 48 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take a team of 5 individuals 48 hours (or two days) to paint an entire house."
