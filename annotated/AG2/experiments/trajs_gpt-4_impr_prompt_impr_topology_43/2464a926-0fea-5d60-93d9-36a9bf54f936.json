This can be done by multiplying the number of sets (10) by the number of balloons in each set (30).\n\n2. Second, we subtract the number of remaining balloons (12) from the total number of prepared balloons. The result will show us how many balloons were used during their water balloon fight. \n\nLet's proceed with these calculations."

Assigned the number of sets (10), the number of balloons in each set (30), and the number of remaining balloons (12) to variables.\n2. Variable `total_balloons` calculated by multiplying the variables `sets` and `balloons`.\n3. Variable `balloons_used` calculated by subtracting `remaining` from `total_balloons`.\n\nBoth agents have assumed no additional variables and followed the problem statement closely. They have both produced the same result: 288.\n\nNeither agent has assumed any additional variables, and they have both drawn from the information provided in the problem statement. The provided Python code is correct based on the information supplied. \n\nTherefore, there were 288 balloons used in their water balloon fight.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{288}"
