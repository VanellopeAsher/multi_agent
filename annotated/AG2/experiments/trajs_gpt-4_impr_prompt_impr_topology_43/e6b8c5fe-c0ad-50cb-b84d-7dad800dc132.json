Calculate the total amount of cents Colby has by adding up these four amounts.\n3. Dividing the total amount of cents Colby has by the cost in cents of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy. (Assuming the cost of each gumball is not provided, so we leave that variable). \n\nLet's describe:\n\nNq = number of quarters = 8\nNd = number of dimes = 6\nNn = number of nickels = 14\nNp = number of pennies = 15\n\nVq = value of a quarter in cents = 25\nVd = value of a dime in cents = 10\nVn = value of a nickel in cents = 5\nVp = value of a penny = 1\n\nTotal Cents = Nq * Vq + Nd * Vd + Nn * Vn + Np * Vp\n\nNumber of gumballs = Total Cents / Cost of Each Gumball\n\nWe need the price of the gumballs to calculate the exact number of gumballs that Colby can buy."
