Add the amount collected from the neighbors ($300) and the online fund ($1200). The total amount collected is $1500 ($300 + $1200).\n\n2. The lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected, so he will donate $4500 (3 x $1500).\n\n3. Additionally, later his friend gives him another $120. The total collection before the lawyer's donation is now $1620 ($1500 + $120).\n\n4. The lawyer's new donation will be three times the total collection that is $4860 (3 x $1620).\n\nTherefore, Walterâ€™s lawyer will contribute $4860."
