This totals 8 clients.\n2. We also know that each client's home requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Therefore, for 8 homes, 16 (2*8) bottles of bleach and 8 packs of cloths will be required.\n3. We know each bottle of bleach costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of bleach for 8 homes would be $32 (16 bottles * $2 per bottle).\n4. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, then the total weekly expenses would be $72 ($92 total income - $20 profit).\n5. Subtract the cost of bleach from the total expenses to find out the total cost of cloths. This would be $40 ($72 total weekly expenses - $32 total bleach cost).\n6. To find out the cost of each pack of cloths, divide the total cost of cloths by the number of packs. This is the cost of each pack of cloths. \n\nAbove steps will provide the solution to the problem."
