We first find how much caffeine he consumes per day by multiplying the amount of caffeine in one cup of coffee (95mg) with the number of breaks he takes per day (3, equal to the number of working hours). That daily amount is then multiplied with the total number of working days.\n- Finally, in step 5, we find the total time Billy spends on paperwork by multiplying the minutes he spends on paperwork every day (30) with the number of working days. This result is then converted to hours."
