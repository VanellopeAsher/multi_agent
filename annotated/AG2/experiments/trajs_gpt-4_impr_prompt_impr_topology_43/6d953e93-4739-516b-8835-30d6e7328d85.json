For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.

So, the mechanic earned 6*60 dollars for truck tires and 4*40 dollars for car tires on Thursday, totaling to 6*60 + 4*40 dollars.\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic only repaired car tires, and he earned 40*C dollars, where C is the number of car tires repaired that day.\n\nGiven that the mechanic earns 40 dollars more on Thursday than on Friday, we can set up the following equation: \n\n    6*60 + 4*40 = 40*C + 40 \n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of C, which is the number of car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday."
