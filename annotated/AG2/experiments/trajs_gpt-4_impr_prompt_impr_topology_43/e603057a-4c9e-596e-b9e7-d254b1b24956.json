      "content": "-I will start solving this problem by setting up two algebraic equations from the information given in the problem.\n\n-Assume that Seth's current age is 'x' and Brooke's current age is 'y'. Given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write the first equation as:\n\n  Equation 1: x = 2y\n\n-The problem also mentions that in three years, the sum of their ages will be 36. So, we can write the second equation as:\n\n  Equation 2: (x + 3) + (y + 3) = 36\n\n-(You add 3 years to both their ages because in three years, Seth will be x + 3 years old, and Brooke will be y + 3 years old.)\n\n-After setting up these two equations, we can solve for 'x' and 'y'. We can simplify Equation 2 and get:\n\n  x + y = 30 \n\n-Next, we substitute Equation 1 (x = 2y) into Equation 2 (x + y = 30), yielding:\n\n  3y = 30. \n\n-So, the solution for 'y' (Brooke's age) is:\n\n  y = 30/3 = 10.\n\n-Finally, we substitute 'y' back into Equation 1 (x = 2y) to find 'x' (Seth's age):\n\n  x = 2 * 10\n\n  x = 20. \n\n-So, Seth is 20 years old. \n\n-Now we discuss this solution with other agents to know their views."

Thus, (Seth's age + 3) + (Brooke's age + 3) = 36, which simplifies to x + y = 30:\n\n```python\neq2 = Eq(x + y, 30)\n```\n\n- Solve these equations for x and y using the sympy's solve function:\n\n```python\nsolution = solve((eq1,eq2), (x, y))\n```\n\n- The solve function will return a dictionary containing the solutions. Extract and print Seth's age:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Seth's age is {solution[x]}\")\n```\n\nNow, I am going to implement the above Python code.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
