Here is my approach:\n\nLet's denote the age of Carver's son as x (in years).\n\nGiven that Carver is 15 years less than ten times the age of his son, we can express this as an equation:\n\nCarver's age = 10 * Carol's son age - 15\n\nSince we know that Carver is 45 years old, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n45 = 10 * x - 15\n\nNext, we solve for x:\n\n+ First, we add 15 to both sides of the equation to get: \n        45 + 15 = 10 * x  --->  60 = 10 * x\n+ After that, we divide each side of the equation by 10 to solve for x:\n        x = 60 / 10  \n        \nFinally, we calculate the value of x:\n\nSo, x is the age of Carver's son in years."

According to them, Carver's son is 6 years old. \n\nThe equation created by Agent Problem Solver, where 45 equals 10 times the son's age minus 15, is accurate given the problem statement. This can be solved for the son's age by adding 15 to both sides and then dividing by 10, which results in 6 years old. This is consistent with the current information available.\n\nAgent Code Executor has also provided the same solution in Python code: sympy has been correctly used to define the son's age as a symbol, create the equation, and solve it, resulting in 6 years old.\n\nBased on this information, I can confidently say that Carver's son is 6 years old.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{6}"
