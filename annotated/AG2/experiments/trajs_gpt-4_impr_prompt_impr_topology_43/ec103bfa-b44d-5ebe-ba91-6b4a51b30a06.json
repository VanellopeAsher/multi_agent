Subtract the total from the total amount Marie paid.\n3. Divide the resulting amount by the cost of each pizza box to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie bought.\n\nCalculations:\n1. Total cost of chicken meal, 5 packs of milk, and 40 apples: $120 + 5*$30 + 40*$1.50\n2. Difference between what Marie paid and the cost of chicken meal, packs of milk, and apples: $900 - total cost of previous items\n3. Number of pizza boxes: difference/cost of each pizza box. \n\nThe result should be rounded down as Marie cannot buy a fractional pizza box."
