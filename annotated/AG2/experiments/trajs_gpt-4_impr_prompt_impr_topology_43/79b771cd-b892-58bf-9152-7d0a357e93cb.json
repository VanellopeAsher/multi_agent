Figure out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone by tripling her original throw distance. \n2. Subtract the distance which Perg's fire reaches from the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.\n3. The result obtained in step 2 is the distance outside the dragon's flames Polly could stand to hit Perg with the gold javelin.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. Polly can throw the javelin 4000 feet, but triple that distance when holding the gemstone, which is 3 * 4000 feet = 12000 feet.\n2. If Perg's flames reach 10000 feet, then Polly could stand 12000 feet - 10000 feet = 2000 feet outside the dragon's flames and still hit Perg with the javelin. \n\nThus, Polly could stand 2000 feet outside of the reach of Perg's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she is holding the gemstone."
