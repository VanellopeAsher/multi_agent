      "content": "Here is my proposed step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Determine the total duration Meredith spent writing articles on Monday.\n\n   Since each article takes about 4 hours to compose and she wrote 5 articles on Monday, Meredith spent a total of 5 * 4 = 20 hours on Monday.\n\n2. Next, determine the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.\n\n   Since she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 (Monday's articles) = 2 articles more that Monday.\n   So, the total number of articles written on Tuesday is 5 (Monday's articles) + 2 = 7 articles.\n\n   In hours, she spent 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours on Tuesday.\n\n3. Figure out the total hours she spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday which is 20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) = 48 hours.\n\n4. Since she spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in all three days, the hours she wrote on Wednesday is 104 total hours - 48 hours (Monday + Tuesday) = 56 hours.\n\n5. Determine the number of articles written on Wednesday by dividing the total hours spent on Wednesday by the hours taken to write one article. That is 56 hours / 4 hours/article = 14 articles.\n\n6. Lastly, find out how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday by comparing the number of articles on both days. This is 14 articles (Wednesday) / 7 articles (Tuesday) = 2 times.\n\nSo, she wrote twice as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday."

We need to find out the number of articles Meredith wrote each day, then calculate the ratio of articles between Wednesday and Tuesday.\n\nLet's follow the steps proposed by Agent_Problem_Solver in a Pythonic way. We'll start by finding out how many hours Meredith spent writing on Monday and Tuesday. \n\nAfter that, we'll figure out how many hours she spent writing on Wednesday by subtracting the total hours spent on Monday and Tuesday from the overall total of 104 hours.\n\nWe'll then calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday by dividing the total Wednesday hours by the number of hours it takes to write one article, which is 4 hours.\n\nFinally, we'll find out how many times as many articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday as on Tuesday.\n\nLet's get started.\n\n```python\n# number of articles written on Monday\nmonday_articles = 5 \n\n# each article takes 4 hours to write\nhours_per_article = 4 \n\n# total hours spent writing on Monday\nmonday_hours = monday_articles * hours_per_article \n\n# she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, so\ntuesday_articles = monday_articles + (2/5) * monday_articles\n\n# total hours spent writing on Tuesday\ntuesday_hours = tuesday_articles * hours_per_article \n\n# total hours spent writing on both Monday and Tuesday\ntotal_hours_mon_tue = monday_hours + tuesday_hours \n\n# total hours spent writing in three days is 104, so she spent the following hours writing on Wednesday\nwednesday_hours = 104 - total_hours_mon_tue \n\n# number of articles written on Wednesday\nwednesday_articles = wednesday_hours / hours_per_article \n\n# finding out how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday\ntimes_more = wednesday_articles / tuesday_articles\nprint(times_more)\n```\n\nThe above code will help us solve the problem using Python. I suggest executing it to get the final result.\n\n**SUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor**"
