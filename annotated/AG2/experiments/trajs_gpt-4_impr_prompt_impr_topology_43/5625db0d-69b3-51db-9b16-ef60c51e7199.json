For the first day:\n   - Calculate the total cost of the 15 apples, by multiplying 15 (the number of apples) by $15 (the cost of each apple).\n   - Subtract the $3 voucher from the total cost to find the final price Clara paid on the first day. \n  \n2. For the second day:\n   - Calculate the total cost of the 15 apples without any discount, by multiplying 15 (the number of apples) by $25 (the cost of each apple).\n   - Calculate the amount that was discounted, by multiplying the total cost by 15%.\n   - Subtract that amount from the total cost to find the final price Sheila paid on the second day.\n    \n3. Finally, subtract the final price on the first day from the final price on the second day to find the difference in prices. \n\nThings to note:\n- It might be important to note the usage of a discount and a voucher and how they affect the total cost differently.\n- It also assumes that the 15% discount is calculated after the initial price of each apple is multiplied by the quantity.\n- Clarifications on these assumptions might be needed to better understand the problem and to ensure a more accurate solution. \n\nIf the assumptions stand, we can proceed with the calculations."
