This is found by multiplying the number of boxes she got with the amount of crayons in a box and then dividing the result by the number of crayons used to make a muffin crayon. After that, we can calculate the price of a muffin crayon by dividing the total amount Kate made by selling all the muffin crayons by the number of crayons she made.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of crayon pieces: 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box\n2. Calculate the total number of muffin crayons: total crayon pieces / 8 pieces per muffin crayan\n3. Calculate the price per muffin crayon: $36 / total muffin crayons"
