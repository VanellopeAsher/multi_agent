Kyle took 6 fries from Griffin, so Griffin was left with 24 fries (30 - 6 = 24).\n3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means he took 2 * 6 = 12 fries. After Billy's action, Griffin was left with 24 - 12 = 12 fries.\n4. It is mentioned that Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. So, Colby took 6 - 3 = 3 fries. After that, Griffin had 12 - 3 = 9 fries.\n5. Then Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and as a result Griffin had 33 fries in the end.\n\nNow, if we subtract the number of fries Griffin had after Colby took his share from the final total, we can determine how many fries Ginger gave Griffin. \n\nThat is, fries given by Ginger = final total fries - Griffin's fries after Colby took his share.\nLet's calculate: 33 - 9 = 24 fries.\n\nSo, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries."
