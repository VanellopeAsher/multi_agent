Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLeah just got a new kitten. Neutering him cost $150, his 2 vaccines costs $30 each, and the kitten broke 3 vases that cost $15 each. How much has the puppy cost so far?"

      "content": "Approach:\n\nThis problem can be solved with simple arithmetic operations:\n\n1. First, multiply the cost of one vaccine by the quantity of vaccines (2 vaccines at $30 each).\n2. Repeat for the cost of the shattered vases (3 vases at $15 each).\n3. Add the product of the two operations above to the neutering cost.\n\nThis calculation can be programmed directly into Python to find the total cost.\n\nHere is the code,\n\n```python\n# define the costs\nneuter_cost = 150\nvaccines_cost = 30\nvaccines_number = 2\nvases_cost = 15\nvases_number = 3\n\n# calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = neuter_cost + (vaccines_cost * vaccines_number) + (vases_cost * vases_number)\n\n# print the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow you can run the code snippet to get the total amount."

Cost of 2 vaccines = 2 * $30 = $60\n3. Cost of 3 broken vases = 3 * $15 = $45\n\nSo, the total cost should be $150 + $60 + $45 = $255.\n\nComparing this with our computed result, they are indeed the same.
