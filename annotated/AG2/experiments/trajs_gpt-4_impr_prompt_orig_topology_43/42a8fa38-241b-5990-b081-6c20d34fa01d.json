Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables.

      "content": "This problem involves simple arithmetic operations. We need to calculate the cost for buying tomato seeds and celery seeds, respectively, and then add the two amounts together to obtain the total spending.\n\nHere is the Python code that does this:\n\n```python\n# quantities of tomato and celery seed packets\ntomato_seed_packets = 20\ncelery_seed_packets = 80\n\n# prices per packet\ntomato_price_per_packet = 40 # $40 per tomato seed packet\ncelery_price_per_packet = 30 # $30 per celery seed packet\n\n# total spending\ntotal = tomato_seed_packets * tomato_price_per_packet + celery_seed_packets * celery_price_per_packet\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\nUpon running this code, it should display the total amount spent on purchasing the seeds. This approach directly solves the problem by directly calculating the result. Once the total cost is calculated, the output can be verified by manual calculation or with a calculator. \n\nLet's execute the Python code and look at the result."

Let's verify this.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the amount spent on tomato seed packets and celery seed packets separately.\n\nFor the tomato seed packets:\n\n$40 per packet * 20 packets = $800\n\nFor the celery seed packets:\n\n$30 per packet * 80 packets = $2400\n\nWe add these together to calculate the total spending:\n\n$800 (tomato seeds) + $2400 (celery seeds) = $3200\n\nThe Python code output did match up with our manual computation. So, the total amount of money she spent on purchasing the seeds is $3200.\n\nHence, final answer is \\boxed{3200}."
