Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. He also wants to make a duvet cover, 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.

To make a comforter for this bed, Jim needs 2 pieces of fabric that are each 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. This makes each piece 8 feet (6+2) in length and 10 feet (2+8) in width.\n\nThe duvet cover is 9 feet in length and 11 feet in width.\n\nTo know how many square feet of fabric Jim needs, we will sum up the areas of all the pieces:\n\n1. Calculate the area for one of the pieces of fabric to cover the bed (length * width). Multiply this by 2 because there are two pieces.\n2. Calculate the area for the duvet cover.\n3. Sum up all the areas.\n\nLet's do it.\n\n```python\n# import necessary libraries\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the dimensions\nlength_comforter, width_comforter = 8, 10\nlength_duvet, width_duvet = 9, 11\n\n# calculate the areas\narea_comforter = length_comforter * width_comforter\narea_duvet = length_duvet * width_duvet\n\n# calculate the total area\ntotal_area = 2 * area_comforter + area_duvet\n\nprint(total_area)\n```"

      "content": "This is the expected result.\n\nVerification:\nLet's validate the solutions step by step, as requested.\n\n1. Calculation:\n   - Length and width of the bed is 6 feet and 8 feet respectively.\n   - Jim wants the the fabric to be 2 feet longer and wider, so for the comforter, the fabric is 8 feet by 10 feet.\n   - Therefore, the area of fabric for the comforter = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.\n   - But since there are 2 pieces of fabric for the comforter, Total area for comforter = 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.\n   \n   - For the duvet cover, the size of fabric is 9 feet by 11 feet. Therefore, the area of fabric for duvet = 9 feet * 11 feet = 99 square feet.\n   \n   - Total fabric = comforter fabric + duvet fabric = 160 square feet + 99 square feet = 259 square feet.\n    \n2. Output:\n   - The expected output format is in number and it is provided as such.\n   \nTherefore, the code works as expected, providing the correct area of fabric Jim need to buy.\n\nSo, accordingly, Jim needs to buy a fabric of area 259 square feet. So, the correct answer is \\( \\boxed{259} \\)."
