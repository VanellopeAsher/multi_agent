Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

We are also given information that Jessica wishes to pay 50% more than the required minimum on her debts, and she continues to pay the regular amount for her gym and Netflix. We are asked to calculate the total amount Jessica would pay in a year (12 months) with these conditions in mind.\n\nHere's how we can break down the math:\n\n1. Calculate the total minimum payment per month for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage.\n3. Calculate the 50% extra payment for her debts.\n4. Subtract the coupon amount she is saving on Netflix.\n5. With these amounts, compute the total monthly payment.\n6. Multiply this monthly total by 12 to get the yearly payment.\n\nLet's compute these steps in the following Python code."

We added all the monthly minimum payments which Jessica had to pay: student loan ($300), credit card ($200), and mortgage ($500), which totals to $1000.\n2. Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so we calculate 50% of $1000, which is $500. Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica wishes to make is $1000 + $500 - $15 (Netflix coupon), resulting in a total of $1485 per month.\n3. Multiply this monthly total by 12 to get the yearly total, which equates to $1485 * 12 = $17820. Thus, the answer is correct."
