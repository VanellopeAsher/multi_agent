Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $300 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1200 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $120 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?"

His lawyer offers to donate three times the total amount that Walter has collected so far. \n\nTo calculate the total amount that Walterâ€™s lawyer will donate, we multiply the total amount Walter has collected so far by 3.\n\nWe can use Python to solve this problem.\n\n```python\n# total money collected by Walter\ntotal_collected_money = 300 + 1200 + 120 \n\n# money contributed by Walter's lawyer\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * total_collected_money\n\n# Display the lawyer's contribution amount\nprint(lawyer_contribution)\n```\n\nNow you can run the above Python code to know the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute."

Walter collected 300$ from his neighbors.\n2. He collected 1200$ from a fund he set up online.\n3. His friend gave him 120$.\nThe total amount he collected from these sources is 300$ + 1200$ + 120$ = 1620$.\nThe problem statement says Walter's lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected. Hence, the lawyer's contribution = 1620$ * 3 = 4860$.\n\nHence, the result seems to be correct.\n\nSo, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \boxed{4860}$ to the charity."
