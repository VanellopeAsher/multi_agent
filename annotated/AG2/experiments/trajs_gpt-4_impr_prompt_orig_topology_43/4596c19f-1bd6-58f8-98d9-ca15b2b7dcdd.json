Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim concocts a unique blend of honey and jam.

Calculate the cost price for a single jar, which will be equal to the sum of the cost of 2 pounds of passionfruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey.\n2. Multiply the cost price for a single jar by 10 to find the total cost price for 10 jars.\n3. Calculate the total selling price for 10 jars by multiplying $50 (the selling price of a single jar) by 10.\n4. Subtract the total cost price from the total selling price to find the total profit earned.\n\nThe variables and calculations involved are:\n- Cost of 1 pound of passionfruit: $6\n- Cost of 1 pound of jackfruit: $8\n- Cost of 1 pound of special honey: $10\n- Number of jars: 10\n- Selling price of 1 jar: $50\n\nLet's compute these in the code below:"

Breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Look at the calculated profit and consider if it makes sense given the initial problem statement:\n   - We know that each jar is sold at a higher price ($50) than the cost to make it.\n   - After selling 10 jars, some profit should be expected.\n   - The calculated total profit is $60 for the sale of 10 jars, meaning Tim earns an average of $6 profit on each jar ($60/10). This seems reasonable given the cost and price of each jar.\n3. Go through the steps of the calculation process again:\n   - The cost of a single jar was calculated correctly by adding the costs of each ingredient. \n   - The total cost for 10 jars was obtained by multiplying the cost of a single jar by the quantity (10).\n   - The total selling price for 10 jars was correctly evaluated by multiplying the selling price of a single jar ($50) by 10.\n   - The total profit was accurately calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price.\n  \nAfter going through these verification steps, confidence in the final answer is high. \n\nThe profit that Tim earns from selling 10 jars of this blend is \\boxed{60}."
