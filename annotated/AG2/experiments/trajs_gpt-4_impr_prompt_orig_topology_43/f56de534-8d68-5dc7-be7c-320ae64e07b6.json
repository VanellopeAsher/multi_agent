Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces, and anther one that had 125 pieces than the 500 piece one.

      "content": "The key here is understanding that some sets have more pieces than others, and all of the pieces in each kind of set must be picked up.\n\nThe problem defines a lego boxed set with 500 pieces. Then, there are three other sets:\n\n- One set has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set\n- One set has 1/4 number of pieces of the 500-piece set\n- One set has 125 more pieces than the 500-piece set\n\nWe can mathematically represent each set as follows:\n\n- The 500-piece set remains as it is: 500 pieces\n- The 3-times-more set is 500 * 3: (3*500) pieces\n- The 1/4 set is 500 / 4: (500/4) pieces\n- The last set with 125 more pieces than the 500-piece set is 500 + 125: (500 + 125) pieces\n\nSumming up all these sets will give us the total number of Lego pieces Johnny must pick up. \n\nThis can be directly solved using Python. Let's go ahead and calculate.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of pieces in the first set\nset1 = 500\n\n# Calculate the number of pieces in the other sets\nset2 = 3 * set1\nset3 = set1 / 4\nset4 = set1 + 125\n\n# Sum all the sets\ntotal_pieces = set1 + set2 + set3 + set4\n\n# Print out the total number of Lego pieces Johnny must pick up\nprint(total_pieces)\n```"
