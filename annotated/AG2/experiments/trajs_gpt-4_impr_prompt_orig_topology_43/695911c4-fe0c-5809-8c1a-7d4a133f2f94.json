Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $10. After 10 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

      "content": "Verification Steps:\n\n1. First, we verified the calculations for Pauline's visits in the first 10 years. Given a cost of 10 dollars per visit and visiting 3 times per year for 10 years, that equates to 10 * 3 * 10 = 300 dollars.\n2. We then evaluated the increase in the cost of a visit. Given an original cost of 10 dollars and an increase of 150%, the new cost per visit would be 10 + (150 / 100 * 10) = 25 dollars.\n3. Next, we verified the cost for Pauline's visits in the following 3 years. Given a new cost of 25 dollars per visit and visiting 3 times per year for 3 years, that comes to 25 * 3 * 3 = 225 dollars.\n4. Lastly, we combined both costs to find the total cost for all of Pauline's visits. So, 300 + 225 equals 525 dollars.\n\nSo, the total amount that Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \\$\\boxed{525}."
