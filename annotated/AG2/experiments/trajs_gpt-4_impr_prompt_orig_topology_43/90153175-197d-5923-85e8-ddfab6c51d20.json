Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "The answer is \\boxed{21}. Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks. \n\nNow, let's verify the solution, step-by-step.\n\n1. We began by identifying and defining our known quantities: the number of eggs Claire eats in a day, the number of days in a week, the number of weeks in question, and the number of eggs in a dozen.\n\n2. We then computed the number of eggs Claire eats in a week by multiplying the number of daily eggs by the number of days in a week. This gave us 3 * 7 = 21 eggs.\n\n3. Next, we calculated the total number of eggs Claire would eat in 12 weeks. To do this, we multiplied the number of eggs she consumes in a week by the number of weeks. This yielded 21 * 12 = 252 eggs.\n\n4. Finally, we converted the total number of eggs into dozens by dividing by the number of eggs in a dozen (i.e., 12). This produced 252 / 12 = 21 dozens.\n\nAfter reviewing these steps, the calculation and the final answer both appear to be correct."
