Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs.

We can then subtract the remaining 10 eggs to get the number of eggs that the friends found.\n\nLet's break this down into a couple of manageable steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs the Smith twins found by multiplying the number one twin found by 2.\n2. Subtract that total from the total number of eggs.\n3. Subtract the remaining 10 eggs.\n\nThere are some missing values in the problem, such as the total number of eggs. Presuming we have this information, we can use Python to perform the calculations.\n\nHere is Python code that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef eggs_found_by_friends(total_eggs):\n    eggs_found_by_smith_twins = 30 * 2\n    remains = total_eggs - eggs_found_by_smith_twins \n    eggs_found_by_friends = remains - 10\n    \n    return eggs_found_by_friends\n```\n\nWe need to fill in the value of `total_eggs` before we can run this.

All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the total number of eggs that were hidden, we cannot calculate the precise number found by the friends.

The friends found all the remaining eggs, except for the 10 that remained unfound.\n\nGiven these conditions, the number of eggs that the friends found does not total the eggs that the Smith twins' found subtracted by the remaining unfound eggs.\n\nInstead, we know the total number of eggs is more than what the Smith twins found (60 eggs) and includes the unfound eggs (10 eggs).
