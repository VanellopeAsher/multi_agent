Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?"

      "content": "Let's break down the problem:\n\n# Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. To figure out how fast John runs, we first need to determine how many miles he runs each day.\n    - John runs 3 days a week.\n    - He runs half as much the other two days he runs.\n2. Compute the miles John runs each day for the three 'high' days and two 'low' days.\n3. Add up the distances for the 'high' and 'low' days to arrive at the total distance John runs in a week, which should be equal to the given total of 60 miles.\n4. If the total distance matches the given total, we can determine that our division of miles is correct.\n5. Since the speed is not specified for each day, we can assume that he runs at the same speed every day.\n\nTo find out speed we need to know time. However, this information is not given in the problem. Hence, the problem is unsolvable.\n\n# Handling Missing Data\n\nSince the time taken by John to run these distances isn't provided, it's impossible to calculate his speed. Hence we can say the solution is 'None'.\n\noced{None}"

We're told that he runs half as much on two days (we'll call these the 'low' days) as he does on the other three days (we'll call these the 'high' days). \n\nLet's call the distance he runs on 'high' days X. Therefore, on 'low' days, he runs X/2. \n\nSo, we can formulate the equation:\n\n3X + 2(X/2) = 60\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the value of X, which will give us the distance John runs on 'high' days.\n\nLet's compute this in the next Python cell: \n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\nX = sp.symbols('X')\nequation = sp.Eq(3*X + 2*(X/2), 60)\nhigh_day_distance = sp.solve(equation, X)\n\nprint(high_day_distance)\n```\nAfter knowing this, we still have to find out more information to estimate the speed."

We could only calculate the speed if we had an estimate of time.\n\n# Verification\n\nStep 1: We found that John runs 15 miles on 'high' days and 7.5 on 'low' days. That's what we had expected.\nStep 2: We checked that these distances do indeed total to the given weekly total of 60 miles.\nStep 3: We concluded that without additional information on how long John takes to run these distances each day, we cannot compute his speed.\n\n# Missing Data \n\nWe don't have the time it takes John to run each day. Hence, we cannot calculate his speed.\n\nSo the answer is:\n \n\\boxed{None}"
