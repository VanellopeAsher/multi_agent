Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

Let's start by importing sympy to use it in the following steps.\n\nHere is the Python code using sympy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# list of known scores\nscores_known = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# calculate sum of known scores\nsum_known = sum(scores_known)\n\n# mean of scores\nmean_score = 70\n\n# total number of scores\ntotal_scores = 9\n\n# calculate sum of total scores\nsum_total = mean_score * total_scores\n\n# calculate the forgotten score\nforgotten_score = sum_total - sum_known\n\n# print the forgotten score\nprint(\"The forgotten score is:\", forgotten_score)\n```"

Now, let's verify the results to confirm.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nWe'll compute the mean score again, this time including the forgotten score, to see if it equals 70, as given in the problem.\n\nHere is the Python code using sympy for verification:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# list of all scores including the forgotten one\nall_scores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60]  # 60 is the forgotten score\n\n# calculate sum of all scores\nsum_all = sum(all_scores)\n\n# total number of scores\ntotal_scores = 9\n\n# calculate the mean score\nmean_score = sum_all / total_scores\n\n# print the mean score\nprint(\"The mean score is:\", mean_score)\n```\n\nLet's see if the calculated mean score is 70, which would confirm the correctness of our solution."
