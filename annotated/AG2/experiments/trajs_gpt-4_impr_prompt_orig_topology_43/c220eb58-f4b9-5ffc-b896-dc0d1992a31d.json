      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?"

      "content": "This problem involves simple arithmetic operations. The total number of messages James delivers is the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson plus the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.\n\nTo break this down into a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Calculate the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu.\n2. Add the number of messages James delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu together to get the total number of messages. \n\nTo calculate the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu, multiply the number of messages James delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.\n\nHere's a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\n# number of messages James delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_to_thompson = 84\n\n# number of messages James delivered to Mr. Yu is 1/3 of what he delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_to_yu = messages_to_thompson * 1/3\n\n# total number of messages James delivered\ntotal_messages = messages_to_thompson + messages_to_yu\nprint(total_messages)\n```\nLet's plug in the numbers and compute the result."

So according to the calculation, James delivered a total of 112 messages.\n\nVerification\n-------------\nTo verify the result, perform the operations a second time.\n\n- Multiply 84 (the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson) by 1/3 to get the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu, which equals 28.\n- Add 28 (total messages delivered to Mr. Yu) to 84 (total messages delivered to Ms. Thompson) to get a total of 112 messages.\n\nAs you can see, both the original calculation and the verification show that James delivered a total of 112 messages. \n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{112}."
