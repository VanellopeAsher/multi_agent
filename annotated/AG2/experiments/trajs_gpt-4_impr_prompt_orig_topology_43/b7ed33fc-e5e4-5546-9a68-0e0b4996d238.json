Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, it's important to note the key pieces:\n\n1. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.\n2. A normal sudoku takes him 30 minutes to complete.\n3. An extreme sudoku takes him 3 times longer than a normal one.\n\nWith these in mind:\n\n1. Calculate how long an extreme sudoku takes by multiplying the normal sudoku time by 3.\n2. Calculate the number of bottles John drinks by dividing the extreme sudoku time by the time it takes John to drink one bottle.\n\nLet's represent this problem in python code:\n\n```python\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30  # in minutes\nextreme_sudoku_factor = 3\n\nextreme_sudoku_time = normal_sudoku_time * extreme_sudoku_factor  # time taken for extreme sudoku in minutes\n\nwater_drinking_rate = 30  # John drinks one water bottle every 30 minutes\n\nwater_bottles_drunk = extreme_sudoku_time / water_drinking_rate  # total bottles of water John drinks\n\nprint(water_bottles_drunk)\n```\nThe output will be the number of bottles John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku."

      "content": "Great, so the result from the Python code indicates that John drinks 3 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle. Now let's verify this:\n\nVerification:\n- It takes John 3 times as long to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle as it does a normal one. A normal puzzle takes 30 minutes, so an extreme Sudoku takes 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.\n- John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, so in 90 minutes, he drinks 90 / 30 = 3 bottles of water.\n\nThis verification ensures our logic and computations are correct and the Python result matches our manual calculation.\n\nHence, final answer is \\boxed{3}."
