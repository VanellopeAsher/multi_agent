Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Monday, a water tank measured 17 feet deep. The following day, the water level rose by an additional 7 feet. By Wednesday, the water level had decreased to two thirds of Tuesday's depth. How deep is the water in the tank on Wednesday?"

Then, to find Wednesday's depth, we need to multiply Tuesday's depth by 2/3.\n\nLet's implement this in Python: \n\n```python\n# Initial water depth on Monday\nmonday_depth = 17  # feet\n\n# Increase in depth on Tuesday\ntuesday_increase = 7  # feet\n\n# Total depth on Tuesday\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + tuesday_increase\n\n# Depth on Wednesday (2/3 of Tuesday's depth)\nwednesday_depth = (2/3) * tuesday_depth\n\nprint(\"Water depth on Wednesday :\", wednesday_depth, \"feet\")\n```"

Please remember to breathe deeply, ensuring clarity of thought before verifying this answer.\n\nVerification:\n1. On Monday, the water tank's depth was 17 feet.\n2. On Tuesday, the water level increased by an additional 7 feet, making the total depth on Tuesday 24 feet (17 + 7).\n3. On Wednesday, the water level decreased to two-thirds of Tuesday's depth. Two-thirds of 24 feet is 16 feet.\n\nGiven these calculations, I am confident that the water's depth in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet. Therefore, my final answer is 16. \n\nIn the specified format, the final answer is \\boxed{16}."
