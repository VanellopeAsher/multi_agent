Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, first, let's calculate the total time John spent doing the activities we know: boating, swimming, and watching shows. \n\nHe spent 6 hours boating, half that time which is 3 hours swimming, and he watched 3 shows which were 2 hours each which totals 6 hours. So, the total time he spent doing these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.\n\nGiven that this total time represents 30% of the total time he spent, we can set up an equation to solve for the total time he spent on vacation. Following that, we can find the time he spent sightseeing by subtracting the time he spent on known activities from the total time he spent on vacation.\n\nLet's express these steps in code:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbol\ntotal_time = symbols('x')\n\n# set up the equation\neq = Eq(0.3 * total_time, 15)\n\n# solve the equation\ntotal_time = solve(eq, total_time)[0]\n\n# calculate the time spent sightseeing\ntime_sightseeing = total_time - 15\n\ntime_sightseeing\n```\nLet's solve it."

The total time spent on vacation is determined by solving the equation 0.3 * total_time = 15, which yields total_time = 50 hours.\n3. Subtracting the time spent on known activities (15 hours) from the total time spent on vacation gives the time spent sightseeing as 35 hours.\n\nHence the final result is \\boxed{35}."
