Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. However, on Fridays, he spends an additional 2 hours at work due to high call volumes. How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday?"

We first need to convert hours to minutes to match the time unit of handling a call. Then we can calculate the number of calls Tim can deal with each day and sum them up for the 5-day work week.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem,\n\n```python\n# convert hours to minutes\nwork_hours_daily = 6 * 60\nextra_work_hours_friday = 2 * 60\n\n# time to handle a call (in minutes)\ncall_time = 15\n\n# number of calls can be handled each day\ncalls_daily = work_hours_daily // call_time\n\n# number of calls on Friday considering extra working hours\ncalls_friday = (work_hours_daily + extra_work_hours_friday) // call_time\n\n# total number of calls in a 5-day work week\ntotal_calls = 4 * calls_daily + calls_friday\n\nprint(total_calls)\n```\n\nAwaiting user's input to confirm the calculations."

It means Tim can deal with 128 calls during his a 5-day work week.\n\nLet's go through the verification steps now to ensure our result is accurate:\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nStep 1 - Deep breath for clarity of thought.\n\nStep 2 - Verification Step by Step:\n1. Tim spends 6 hours each day at work which is equivalent to 6*60 = 360 minutes.\n2. Therefore, Tim can deal with a maximum of 360/15, which equals 24 calls each day from Monday to Thursday.\n3. On Friday, he works for an additional 2 hours, totaling 8 hours or 480 minutes. Therefore, Tim can deal with 480/15, which equals 32 calls on Friday.\n4. Adding up all the calls, we get 4*24 (Monday to Thursday) + 32 (Friday), which equals 128 calls.\n\nStep 3 - Certainty of the answer:\nThe final result 128 is correct based on the calculation and step-by-step verification.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nTim can deal with \boxed{128} calls during his 5-day work week."
