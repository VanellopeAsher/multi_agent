Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours. He then works double that duration on Wednesday. On Thursday, he puts in 2 hours less than his Wednesday's work hours. What is the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days?"

      "content": "The key idea or concept needed to solve this problem is simple arithmetic. Using the given information, we can perform calculations to find the total number of hours Bruce has worked over the three days.\n\nLet's approach this problem through a step-by-step process.\n\n1. Calculate the total hours Bruce works on Wednesday: \n\n   On Tuesday, Bruce worked for 5 hours. So, he works double that on Wednesday.\n\n2. Calculate the total hours Bruce works on Thursday: \n\n   On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than what he did on Wednesday.\n\n3. Sum up the total work hours for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to find the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days.\n\nTaking into account the above steps, the Python code is:\n\n```python\ntuesday_work_hours = 5\nwednesday_work_hours = 2 * tuesday_work_hours\nthursday_work_hours = wednesday_work_hours - 2\n\ntotal_work_hours = tuesday_work_hours + wednesday_work_hours + thursday_work_hours\nprint(total_work_hours)\n```\n\nAwaiting your results obtained from the above."

On Wednesday, Bruce worked for 2 * 5 = 10 hours, which is twice the duration of Tuesday's work hours. This, too, is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n3. On Thursday, he worked for 10 - 2 = 8 hours, which is 2 hours less than Wednesday. This aligns with the information given in the problem.\n\n4. The total sum of work hours for Tuesday (5 hours), Wednesday (10 hours), and Thursday (8 hours) comes to 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours. \n\nSo, the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days is indeed 23 hours. Therefore, the final answer is [23].\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{23}."
