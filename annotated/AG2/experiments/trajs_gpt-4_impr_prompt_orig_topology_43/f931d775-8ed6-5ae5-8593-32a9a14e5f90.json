  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his.

      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.

      "content": "Let's solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of lines for the first scene: We know that the first scene has twice the number of lines than the song, so we can represent this as follows:\n   first_scene_total_lines = 2 * song_lines\n\n2. Calculate Sean's lines for the first scene: We know that Sean has to memorize only a third of the lines in the first scene, so we can represent this as follows:\n   sean_first_scene_lines = first_scene_total_lines / 3\n\n3. Calculate the number of lines for the second scene: We know that the second scene has six more lines than the song, so we can represent this as follows:\n   second_scene_total_lines = song_lines + 6\n\n4. Calculate Sean's lines for the second scene: We know that Sean has four-fifths of the second scene lines, so we can represent this as follows:\n   sean_second_scene_lines = four_fifths * second_scene_total_lines\n\n5. Add the extra lines Sean has to memorize for the second scene. We represent this as follows:\n   sean_second_scene_lines += extra_lines\n\n6. Sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize: We add the number of song lines, first scene lines and second scene lines that Sean has to memorize to get the total number of lines. We represent this as follows:\n   total_lines = sean_song_lines + sean_first_scene_lines + sean_second_scene_lines\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations."
