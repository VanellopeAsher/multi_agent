Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

      "content": "Given that the total length of the ribbon that Marty has is 'L' units long, he cuts this ribbon into four equal parts. Each part is then further cut into five equal parts.\n\nTherefore, the problem is asking for the length of each of the final pieces of ribbon. \n\nThe first step divides the ribbon into 4 equal parts. Following this, each of the 4 pieces is divided into 5 equal parts. \n\nTherefore, in total, Marty will have 4 * 5 = 20 pieces of ribbon.\n\nThis implies that each piece of ribbon is L/20 units long, where L is the total length of the ribbon.\n\nWe do not yet know the value of L, the total length of the ribbon. \n\nTherefore the calculation we can perform in Python is length_of_each_piece = L/20. \n\nHowever, as L is unknown, we will not be able to provide a numerical value. As such, the answer to the problem, given the current information, is:\n\n\\boxed{length\\_of\\_each\\_piece = L/20}"
