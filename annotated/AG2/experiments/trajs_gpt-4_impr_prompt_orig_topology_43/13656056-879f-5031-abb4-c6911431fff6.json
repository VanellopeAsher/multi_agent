Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $300 every day. He worked for an entire week and spent a total of $1000. How much does he have left?"

      "content": "Key Idea: To get the answer, we need to compute the total income that Gerald made for the week and then subtract from it the amount he spent.\n\n**Approach**: Direct Python Solution\n\nLet's consider:\n* Gerald earns $300 per day. \n* A standard work week consists of five days (considering weekends off).\n* Gerald spent $1000 during the entire week. \n\n## Step-by-step Process:  \n\n* Calculate Gerald's earning for the entire week.\n* Subtract the amount he spent from the total earning to find out how much money is left.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate Gerald's earning for the entire week\ndaily_income = 300\ndays_worked = 5\ntotal_income = daily_income * days_worked\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the leftover money\nmoney_spent = 1000\nmoney_left = total_income - money_spent\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\n## Verification Steps: \n\n1. Based on the problem statement, Gerald earns $300 per day and works for 5 days a week. So the total earning for the week should be $300 * 5 = $1500.\n2. Gerald spent $1000 during the entire week. To find out how much money he has left, we need to subtract the amount spent from the total income. So, the money left would be $1500 - $1000 = $500.\n   \nHence, the final answer would be $500. So, the Python code above will print 500, which is the correct and expected output.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{500}."
