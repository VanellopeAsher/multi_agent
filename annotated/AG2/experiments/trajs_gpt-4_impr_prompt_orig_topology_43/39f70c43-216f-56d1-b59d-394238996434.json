Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?"

Subtract the total cost from the amount paid which is fifty dollars.\n\nLet's denote:\nHamburgers: `h`\nPrice per hamburger: `hp`\nPacks of potato fries: `p`\nPrice per pack: `pp`\nCans of fruit drink: `c`\nPrice per can: `cp`\nAmount paid: `ap`\n\n\nThe total cost equals the number of hamburgers times the price per hamburger (h*hp) plus the number of packs of potato fries times the price per pack (p*pp), plus the number of cans of fruit drink times the price per can (c*cp).\n\nThe change is calculated as the difference between the amount paid and the total cost (ap - total cost).\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide the price for one can of fruit drink, thus the problem can't be solved. Hence the solution is `None`."
