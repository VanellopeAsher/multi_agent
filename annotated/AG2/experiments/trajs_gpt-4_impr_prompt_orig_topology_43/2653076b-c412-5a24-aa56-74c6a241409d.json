Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.50 apiece, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4.50 apiece and 13 blueberry muffins that were $1.50 apiece.  At check out, Marcus shows his loyalty card that gives him 10% off of his purchase.  What is Marcus' total bill?"

Multiplying the number of items by the price per piece gives the total cost for that item.\n2. Total up the cost for all items to find the pre-discount total.\n3. Apply the discount by multiplying the pre-discount total by 10% and subtracting that from the pre-discount total.\n\nLet's code this approach:\n\n```python\n# pricing details \ncroissants_price = 5 * 3.50\ncinnamon_rolls_price = 4 * 2.50\nmini_quiches_price = 3 * 4.50\nblueberry_muffins_price = 13 * 1.50\n\n# total calculation pre-discount\ntotal_pre_discount = croissants_price + cinnamon_rolls_price + mini_quiches_price + blueberry_muffins_price\n\n# discount calculation\ndiscount = total_pre_discount * 10 / 100\n\n# final total calculation\ntotal_after_discount = total_pre_discount - discount\n\nprint(total_after_discount)\n```\n\nThis script will provide the total amount to be paid by Marcus after the 10% discount."

The cost for 3 mini quiches at $4.50 apiece is $13.50.\n4. The cost for 13 blueberry muffins at $1.50 apiece is $19.50.\n5. The total cost before the discount is $17.50 + $10.00 + $13.50 + $19.50 = $60.50.\n6. 10% of $60.50 is $6.05. \n7. Subtracting the discount from the total gives us $60.50 - $6.05 = $54.45.\n\nThe calculations above confirm the result obtained from the Python code.\n\nSo, Marcus' total bill comes to \\$54.45.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{54.45}."
