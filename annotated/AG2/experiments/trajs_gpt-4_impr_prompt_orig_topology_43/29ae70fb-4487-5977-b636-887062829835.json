Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

      "content": "Let's solve this by doing simple calculations.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach: Direct Python Solution\n\nFirst, compute the maximum amount per Karate class Manny's parents are willing to pay, which is given as $10. Then, find out how much Manny has already paid for the Karate classes, which is $60. \n\nNext we will calculate the maximum number of classes Manny could attend to keep the cost below or equal to $10 per class. Following that we will subtract the total number of Karate classes from the maximum number of classes Manny could attend, to get the number of classes he can afford to miss.\n\nCode to solve the problem:\n```python\ncost_per_class_limit = 10\ntotal_karate_class_cost = 60\ntotal_karate_classes = 10\n\nmax_classes_Manny_can_attend = total_karate_class_cost // cost_per_class_limit\nmissed_classes = total_karate_classes - max_classes_Manny_can_attend\n\nprint(missed_classes)\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that \"more than $10 per class\" means strictly over $10 and not $10 inclusive. It also assumes the missed classes still need to be paid for (which seems likely as the $60 was paid upfront). If either of these assumptions were incorrect the solution would need to be adjusted. They seem the most likely assumptions from the provided wording however."

      "content": "Great, your answer is correct. The number of classes Manny can miss before the cost of each class exceeds $10 is indeed 4. \n\nYou can verify your result using the following method:\n\nAs Manny paid 60 dollars for the karate classes in total, and there are 10 lessons in total, every lesson initially costs 60 / 10 = 6 dollars. \n\nSuppose Manny misses x classes. Then the cost per attended class rises to 60 / (10-x) dollars. \n\nIf Manny's parents are unwilling to pay more than $10 for each class, the inequality 60 / (10 - x) should be <= 10, solving the inequality gives us:\n\nx <= 4\n\nThus, Manny can miss at most 4 karate classes. If he misses more than 4, then the cost per attended class will exceed $10.\n\nFinal answer: oxed{4}\nNote: This implies that the missed classes still need to be paid for (which seems probable as the $60 upfront payment is not refundable)."
