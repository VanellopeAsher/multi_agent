Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

      "content": "Approach: First, from the problem, we understand that the price of large stuffed animals is three times the price of small ones. So, large stuffed animals cost $40 * 3 = $120 each. \n\nSecond, the total amount earned is the product of the number of items sold and the price of each product. We know Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animal as large ones. So, if we denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x', the total amount from selling large stuffed animals will be $120 * x and the total amount from selling small stuffed animals will be $40 * 2x.\n\nFinally, it is mentioned that the total earned from the sales today is $1200. So, the sum of the amount earned from selling large and small stuffed animals should be equal to $1200. We can set up this equation and solve for 'x' using Python. The number of small stuffed animals sold will then be 2 * 'x'.\n\nLet's write Python code to solve this problem."

It is important to get the value in integer as the number of sold items cannot be in fractions. This is what we wanted to know. So, we can use this number in the final result."

      "content": "Great! The Python code indicates that Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.\n\n## Verification\n\nVERIFICATION Process:\n1. According to the problem, the price of the large stuffed animal is 40 * 3 = $120.\n2. The number of large animals sold is small_sold / 2. From the Python calculation, small_sold = 12. So, the number of large animals sold = 12 / 2 = 6.\n3. The total earning from the large stuffed animals = number of large animals sold * price of large stuffed animal = 6 * 120 = $720.\n4. The total earning from the small stuffed animals = number of small animals sold * price of small stuffed animal = 12 * 40 = $480.\n5. The total earning from large and small stuffed animals = 720 + 480 = $1200, which matches with the problem statement. Thus, the Python calculation is correct.\n\nHence, Theresa sold \\boxed{12} small stuffed animals."
