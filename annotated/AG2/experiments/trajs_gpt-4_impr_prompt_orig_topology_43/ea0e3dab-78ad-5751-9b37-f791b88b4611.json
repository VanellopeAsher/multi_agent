Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month. If the streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged her 15% less money on the other half of the year, calculate the total amount she had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year."

First, calculate the total cost for the first half of the year which is straightforward\n2. Second, calculate the cost for a month for the second half of the year that is 15% less than the normal monthly cost\n3. Third, multiply the reduced monthly cost by the number of months in the second half\n4. Lastly, sum the first and second half costs\n\nSo we can proceed directly to solve it.\n\nLet's start:\n\n```python\n# initial monthly cost\ncost_per_month = 200\n\n# number of months in a half-year\nmonths_half_year = 6\n\n# first half of the year cost\nfirst_half_cost = cost_per_month * months_half_year\n\n# calculate the reduced cost per month for the second half year\ncost_per_month_2nd_half = cost_per_month - 0.15 * cost_per_month \n\n# calculate the second half of the year cost\nsecond_half_cost = cost_per_month_2nd_half * months_half_year\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = first_half_cost + second_half_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis script will directly compute the total amount she had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year."

Check the correctness of the first half cost, which is simply 6 * $200 = $1200.\n2. Check the calculation of the reduced cost in the second half. The discounted price is simply $200 - 0.15 * $200 = $170.\n3. Verify the cost of the service for the second half of the year, which is 6 * $170 = $1020.\n4. Lastly, ensure the total cost is the sum of the first and second halves, which is $1200 + $1020 = $2220.\n\nThe step-by-step verification is therefore completed and the answer is correct. \n\nThus, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $2220. \n\nAs a result, the answer is \\boxed{2220}."
