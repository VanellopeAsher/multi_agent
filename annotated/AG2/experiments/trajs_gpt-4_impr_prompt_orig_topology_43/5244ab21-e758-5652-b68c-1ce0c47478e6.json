Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges. She gifted her mother and her sibling two boxes each. She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself and sold the rest. If each box has 20 oranges, can you determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold?"

She gifted some boxes to her mother and sibling, keeping some for herself and selling the rest.\n\nNow, let's convert that into mathematical terms:\n- Mrs. Harrington initially had 12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges.\n- She gave out 4 boxes, i.e., 2 boxes each to her mother and sibling, which is 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.\n- So, the oranges left with her after gifting are 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges.\n- She kept a quarter of the remaining oranges to herself, i.e., 1/4 * 160 oranges = 40 oranges.\n- The rest she sold, which is 160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges.\n\nLet's put it into Python code to calculate the final result."
