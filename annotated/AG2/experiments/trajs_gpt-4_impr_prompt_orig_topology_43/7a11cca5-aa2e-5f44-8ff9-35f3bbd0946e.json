Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases on the third day so that the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons, calculate the increase amount in the third day."

Since the volume doubles after heavy rain, it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. \n\nOn the third day, the total amount of water passing through the river is 14000 gallons, according to the problem statement.\n\nFinally, to determine the increase in the quantity of water on the third day, we subtract the volume on the second day from the volume on the third day. This would be 14000 - 8000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nNow, you can calculate it step by step:\n\n```python\n# Initial amount of water\ninitial_volume = 4000\n\n# Volume after one day of heavy rain\nsecond_day_volume = 2 * initial_volume\n\n# Total volume on the third day\nthird_day_total_volume = 14000\n\n# Increase in volume on the third day\nincrease_third_day = third_day_total_volume - second_day_volume\n\nprint(increase_third_day)\n```\n\nThis script will compute the increased amount of water on the third day in gallons."
