Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag.

      "content": "**Problem-Solving Approach:**\n\nThis question involves solving a profit equation.\n\nThe key idea is to understand how profit is calculated. \n\nProfit is the difference between total revenue (what the trader gets from selling the wheat bags) and total cost (what he has to pay to buy and transport the wheat bags). \n\nTotal revenue is the sell price per bag times the number of bags.\nTotal cost is the buy price per bag plus transport cost per bag, all times number of bags.\n\nIn the problem, we know:\n- Sell price per bag = $30\n- Buy price per bag = $20\n- Transport price per bag = $2\n- Total profit = $400\n\nLet X be the number of bags.\n\nThis gives us an equation for profit: \n\nTotal revenue - total cost = profit\n\n(30X) - ((20X) + (2X)) = $400\n\nWe simplify that to:\n\n30X - 22X = $400\n\nThen solve for X.\n\nNow, let's go to the Python code to solve for X. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# declare a symbol \nx = symbols('x')\n\n# equation \neq = Eq(30*x - 22*x, 400)\n\n# solve equation\nbag_number = solve(eq)[0]\nprint(bag_number)\n```\n\nFinally, we will verify the obtained result. \n\nLet's calculate the total revenue which the trader gets: $30 * X\nAnd the total cost which he pays: $20 * X + $2 * X\nWe can then check that total revenue - total cost = $400. \n\nAgain, we'll use Python to do these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Verification\ntotal_revenue = 30 * bag_number\ntotal_cost = 22 * bag_number\nprofit = total_revenue - total_cost\nprint(profit)\n```\n\nAnd we should find that profit = $400. If that's the case, the number of bags will be our final solution. \n\nNow, let's go to verify this step using Python code."
