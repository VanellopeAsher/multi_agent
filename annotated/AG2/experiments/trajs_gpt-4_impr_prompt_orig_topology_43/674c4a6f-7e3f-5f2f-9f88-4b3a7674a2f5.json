Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class.

      "content": "Alright! This is a Direct Python Solution as we can solve this problem directly using Python. \n\nThe key idea here is to calculate the average of several numerical values which is a basic arithmetic operation.\nWe can use Python's built-in functions to calculate the average of Wilson's test scores. \n\nThe average of a list of numbers can be calculated using the formula: **sum of numbers / total count of numbers.**\n\nLet's proceed with that solution by following these steps:\n1. Initialize a list with Wilson's test scores.\n2. Use Python's built-in `sum()` function to find the sum of the test scores.\n3. Divide the sum by the count of test scores to get the average.\n\nHere is a Python solution for this case.\n\n```python\n# Wilson's test scores\nscores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate sum of the test scores\ntotal = sum(scores)\n\n# Calculate average by dividing total score with count of scores\naverage = total / len(scores)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(average)\n```\n\nAfter running the above Python code, we will get Wilson's current math grade."

If the grading system doesn't allow decimal grades, we should take only the integer part which is 84, or round it to the nearest integer which is 84 in this case. \n\nIf this is not the case and decimal grades are allowed, his math grade would remain as 84.2.\n\nSo, his math grade is 84 if decimals are not allowed, otherwise the grade is 84.2. \n\nPlease make sure to check with your school's grading system before deciding on which one to consider."
