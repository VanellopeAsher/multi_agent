You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon Monica can allocate to each present's bow. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Presents:** \n   - Add the number of presents for family members, buddies, and educators together.\n\n2. **Divide the Total Ribbon by the Total Number of Presents:**\n   - This will give us the length of ribbon that can be allocated for each present's bow.\n\nSince these calculations can be done directly, we can write a Python program to solve this problem.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of presents for each category\npresents_for_family = 6\npresents_for_buddies = 4\npresents_for_educators = 2\n\n# Total number of presents\ntotal_presents = presents_for_family + presents_for_buddies + presents_for_educators\n\n# Total ribbon available in inches\ntotal_ribbon = 144\n\n# Calculate the length of ribbon per present\nribbon_per_present = total_ribbon / total_presents\n\n# Output the result\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(ribbon_per_present))\n```\n\nThis code calculates the length of ribbon that can be assigned to each present and represents it as a fraction instead of a decimal, using the `sympy` package's `Rational` function. Let's execute this to find the result."
