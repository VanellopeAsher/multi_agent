You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

Let's denote the distance John runs on one of his longer running days as \\( x \\).\n2. On the other two days, he runs half of that amount, which is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n\nThe total miles he runs in a week can be expressed as:\n\\[ x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} = 60 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation and solve for \\( x \\) to find out how many miles John runs on his long day. Then, we can easily determine how many miles he runs on the other two days.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation representing the total distance John runs in a week\nequation = Eq(x + x/2 + x/2, 60)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"John runs {solution[0]} miles on his long day.\")\nprint(f\"John runs {solution[0] / 2} miles on each of the other two days.\")\n```\n\nThis will give us the amount John runs on each of his running days, presented in fractional form if applicable."

We would need information on how long it takes John to run each of these distances to calculate an exact speed.\n\nWithout additional information regarding the time it takes for John to complete his runs, we cannot accurately calculate his speed. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information alone, the final conclusion about John's running distances is:\n\n- On one day, John runs \\boxed{30} miles.\n- On each of the other two days, John runs \\boxed{15} miles.\n\nIf you have additional information that includes the time it takes for him to complete his runs, please provide it so we can accurately calculate his speed."
