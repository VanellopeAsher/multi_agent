You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

The lawyer then donates three times this total amount. Let's proceed to calculate this.\n\n1.

Calculate the lawyer's donation as three times the total contribution excluding himself.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic mathematics\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the contributions\nneighbors_contribution = 300\nonline_fund_contribution = 1200\nfriend_contribution = 120\n\n# Total contribution excluding the lawyer\ntotal_excluding_lawyer = neighbors_contribution + online_fund_contribution + friend_contribution\n\n# Lawyer's contribution is three times the above total\nlawyers_contribution = 3 * total_excluding_lawyer\n\n# Print the lawyer's contribution\nprint(lawyers_contribution)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the lawyer's contribution based on the total other contributions."
