  "problem": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?",

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone.\n2. Calculate how far beyond the dragon's flame range this distance allows her to stand.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. Normally, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 4000 feet.\n2. While holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther: \\(3 \\times 4000\\) feet.\n3. Calculate the difference between the range of the dragon's flames and the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.\n\nSince it's straightforward to solve with Python, let's use Python code to find this distance.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the distances\nnormal_throw_distance = 4000\nenhanced_throw_distance = 3 * normal_throw_distance\ndragon_flame_distance = 10000\n\n# Calculate how far Polly can stand outside the dragon's flame reach\ndistance_outside_flame_reach = enhanced_throw_distance - dragon_flame_distance\n\n# Output the result using print\nprint(distance_outside_flame_reach)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code and find the answer."
