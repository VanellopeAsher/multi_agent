You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables.

Since this calculation involves simple arithmetic, we can use Python to compute the total cost directly. \n\nHere is the plan:\n1. Multiply the number of tomato seed packets by the price per tomato seed packet to get the total cost of tomato seeds.\n2. Multiply the number of celery seed packets by the price per celery seed packet to get the total cost of celery seeds.\n3. Add these two amounts to get the total amount spent.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate and print the total amount:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of seed packets and their prices\nnum_tomato_packets = 20\nnum_celery_packets = 80\nprice_per_tomato_packet = 40\nprice_per_celery_packet = 30\n\n# Calculate the total cost for each type of seed\ntotal_cost_tomato = num_tomato_packets * price_per_tomato_packet\ntotal_cost_celery = num_celery_packets * price_per_celery_packet\n\n# Calculate the total amount spent\ntotal_amount_spent = total_cost_tomato + total_cost_celery\n\n# Print the total amount\nprint(total_amount_spent)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the total amount spent by Mrs. Rylan on purchasing the seeds."
