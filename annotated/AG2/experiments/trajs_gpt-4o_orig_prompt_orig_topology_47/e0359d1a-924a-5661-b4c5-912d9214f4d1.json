You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween.

Calculate the total amount of candy by summing the candy each person had.\n2. Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people (3) to find out how much candy each person will have.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Amount of candy each person has\nrobert_candy = Rational(3)\ncindy_candy = Rational(5)\naaron_candy = Rational(4)\n\n# Total candy\ntotal_candy = robert_candy + cindy_candy + aaron_candy\n\n# Number of people to share the candy\nnumber_of_people = 3\n\n# Calculate the amount of candy each person would have\ncandy_each = total_candy / number_of_people\n\n# Output result\nprint(candy_each)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will yield the amount of candy each person will have in fractional form."
