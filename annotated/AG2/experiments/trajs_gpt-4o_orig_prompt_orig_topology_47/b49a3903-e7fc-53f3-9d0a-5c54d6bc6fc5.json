      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step to determine how many rows of each type of tulip Jackson can plant and, ultimately, find the total number of flower rows. We'll follow Case 3 because the solution requires several steps and calculations that are straightforward.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of rows for each color:**\n   - Determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant.\n   - Determine how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant.\n   - Determine how many rows of yellow tulips Jackson can plant.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of rows including the yellow rows:**\n   - Since Jackson adds a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips, we need to incorporate those into the total.\n\nLet's outline this in detail:\n\n1. **Rows of Red Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in one row and he has 36 red tulips. \n   - Rows of red tulips = Total red tulips / Tulips per row = 36 / 6 = 6 rows.\n\n2. **Rows of Blue Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in one row and he has 24 blue tulips.\n   - Rows of blue tulips = Total blue tulips / Tulips per row = 24 / 8 = 3 rows.\n\n3. **Rows of Yellow Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 5 yellow tulips in one row and he has 30 yellow tulips.\n   - Rows of yellow tulips = Total yellow tulips / Tulips per row = 30 / 5 = 6 rows.\n\n4. **Total Rows of Flowers:**\n   - There is a row of yellow tulips between each row of red and blue tulips. Since he has 3 blue rows, there will be 3 additional yellow rows between red and blue rows.\n   - Total flower rows = Red rows + Blue rows + Yellow rows in-between \n   - Total flower rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 3 (yellow in-between) = 12 rows.\n\nNow, let's use Python to confirm these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\nyellow_tulips = 30\n\n# Rows calculation\nrows_red = red_tulips // 6\nrows_blue = blue_tulips // 8\nrows_yellow_available = yellow_tulips // 5\n\n# Since yellow rows are placed between each red and blue pair, letâ€™s calculate\n# Total pairs of (red - yellow - blue)\n# There will be a yellow row between every red and blue row.\nyellow_rows_needed = rows_blue  # as there are 3 rows of blue, we need 3 yellow\n\ntotal_rows = rows_red + rows_blue + yellow_rows_needed\n\nprint(\"Total rows of flowers:\", total_rows)\n```\n\nRunning this would output:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jackson will plant a total of 12 rows of flowers."
