Calculate the total cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes.\n2. Determine the maximum number of classes he can miss while maintaining the per-class cost within the allowed $10.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution using sympy for dealing with fractions:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Symbol, solve, Rational\n\n# Total cost for Karate classes\ntotal_cost = 60\n\n# Total number of classes\ntotal_classes = 10\n\n# Cost per class limit\ncost_limit_per_class = 10\n\n# Let x be the number of classes Manny attends\nx = Symbol('x', integer=True)\n\n# Write the inequality for the cost limit per class\ncost_per_class_expr = total_cost / x <= cost_limit_per_class\n\n# Solve the inequality\nsolution = solve(cost_per_class_expr, x)\n\n# Find the number of classes he can miss\nmax_classes_attended = max(solution)\n\n# Calculate missed classes\nmissed_classes = total_classes - max_classes_attended\n\n# Output the result\nprint(missed_classes)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the maximum number of Karate classes Manny can miss to keep his average cost per attended class within the $10 limit. Upon running the solution, the result tells us:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the per-class cost exceeds $10."

Compute the number of missed classes from this result.\n\nHere is the revised code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import solve, ceiling\n\n# Total cost for Karate classes\ntotal_cost = 60\n\n# Total number of classes\ntotal_classes = 10\n\n# Cost per class limit\ncost_limit_per_class = 10\n\n# Solve for maximum number of classes Manny can attend\n# So that per class cost is not more than $10\nmax_attended_classes = total_cost // cost_limit_per_class\n\n# Calculate number of missed classes\nmissed_classes = total_classes - max_attended_classes\n\n# Output the result\nprint(missed_classes)\n```\n\nRunning this script will give us the number of classes Manny can miss.
