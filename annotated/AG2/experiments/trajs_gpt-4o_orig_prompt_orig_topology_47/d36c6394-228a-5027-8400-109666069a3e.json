You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break down the events that occur at each stop and calculate the number of passengers step by step. We can use Python to perform the arithmetic calculations.\n\nHere is a concise explanation of the key steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: Start with 48 passengers on the bus.\n\n2. **First Stop**:\n   - 8 passengers get off.\n   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on: \\(5 \\times 8\\).\n   - 2 people who just got on decide to get off again.\n   - Calculate the total number of passengers after the first stop.\n\n3. **Second Stop**:\n   - 21 passengers get off.\n   - 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the people who got off will get on: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 21\\).\n   - Calculate the total number of passengers after the second stop.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of passengers initially\ninitial_passengers = 48\n\n# First stop\npassengers_off_first_stop = 8\npassengers_getting_on_first_stop = 5 * passengers_off_first_stop\npassengers_getting_off_again = 2\n\n# Total passengers after first stop\npassengers_after_first_stop = initial_passengers - passengers_off_first_stop + passengers_getting_on_first_stop - passengers_getting_off_again\n\n# Second stop\npassengers_off_second_stop = 21\npassengers_getting_on_second_stop = passengers_off_second_stop / 3\n\n# Total passengers after second stop\npassengers_after_second_stop = passengers_after_first_stop - passengers_off_second_stop + passengers_getting_on_second_stop\n\n# Print the final number of passengers\nprint(passengers_after_second_stop)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.
