The following day, they used ten bandages less than the previous day. On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages and only expended half a pack.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack.

This problem can be solved directly with Python, so we'll follow Case 1. We'll track the number of bandages used, purchased, and remaining.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \\( x \\).\n2. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and acquired 50 more, leaving them with \\( x - 38 + 50 \\).\n3. On the second day, they used 28 bandages (ten less than the first day), leading to \\( x - 38 + 50 - 28 \\).\n4. On the third day, they acquired two packs (100 bandages) and used half a pack (25 bandages), resulting in:\n   \\[\n   x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = \\text{remaining bandages}\n   \\]\n5. According to the problem, 78 bandages were remaining at the conclusion of the third day.\n\nLet's set this up in a Python script to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the total bandages after three days\nremaining_bandages = x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25\n\n# Set up equation\nequation = Eq(remaining_bandages, 78)\n\n# Solve the equation\ninitial_bandages = solve(equation, x)\nprint(initial_bandages)\n```\n\nThis code will determine the initial number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day. Let's complete the computation."
