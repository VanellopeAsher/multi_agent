You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

This problem can be solved using straightforward arithmetic calculations, so it falls under Case 1.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Elise writes the alphabet in full three times.\n2. Elise writes half of the alphabet once.\n3. Then Elise rewrites everything she has already written.\n\nThe alphabet contains 26 letters. Let's use Python to calculate the total number of letters:\n\n```python\n# Number of letters in the alphabet\nalphabet_count = 26\n\n# Step 1: Writes the alphabet in full three times\ntotal_written = 3 * alphabet_count\n\n# Step 2: Writes half of the alphabet once\ntotal_written += alphabet_count // 2  # 13 letters for half of the alphabet\n\n# Step 3: Rewrites everything written so far\ntotal_written *= 2\n\n# Print the total number of letters written\nprint(total_written)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of letters Elise has written."
