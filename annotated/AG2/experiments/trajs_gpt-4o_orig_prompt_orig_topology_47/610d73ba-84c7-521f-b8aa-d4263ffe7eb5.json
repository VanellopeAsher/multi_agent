You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPaisley, Reggie, and Lynn went for a run.

Reggie ran a distance that is five times the distance Paisley ran, which means Reggie ran \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) miles.\n3. Reggie's distance is also 3 miles more than what Lynn ran.\n\nLet's denote the distance that Lynn ran as \\( L \\). According to the problem, Reggie's distance (20 miles) is 3 miles more than Lynn's distance. Hence, we have the equation:\n\n\\[ 20 = L + 3 \\]\n\nTo find the distance Lynn ran, we can solve this equation.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to solve for \\( L \\):\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Equation setup\nequation = Eq(20, L + 3)\n\n# Solve the equation\nL_distance = solve(equation, L)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Lynn ran a distance of {L_distance} miles.\")\n```\n\nRunning this Python code will give us the distance that Lynn ran."
