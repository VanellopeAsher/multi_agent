You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jessica spends on her debts per month if she pays 50% more than the minimum payments and then multiply by 12 to get the annual payment. This is a straightforward calculation that can be easily handled with Python.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly payment for each debt when paying 50% more than the minimum.\n2. Sum these payments to find the total monthly payment.\n3. Multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to find the total annual payment.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary library for handling fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the minimum payments for each debt\nstudent_loan_min = 3000\ncredit_card_min = 2000\nmortgage_min = 5000\n\n# Calculate the payments with 50% more than the minimum\nstudent_loan_payment = student_loan_min * Rational(3, 2)  # 50% more is 1.5 times the minimum\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min * Rational(3, 2)\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min * Rational(3, 2)\n\n# Calculate the total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate the total annual payment\ntotal_annual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\nprint(total_annual_payment)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find the answer."
