We will approach this with Case 1, as the problem can be solved directly using Python to compute the solution.\n\n### Key Ideas:\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n2. Let \\( y \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n3. We know from the problem:\n   - Each small stuffed animal costs $40.\n   - Each large stuffed animal costs 3 times more than a small one, i.e., $120.\n   - Teresa earned $1200 in total.\n   - She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\( x = 2y \\).\n\n### Equation Setup:\n- The total revenue from small stuffed animals is \\( 40x \\).\n- The total revenue from large stuffed animals is \\( 120y \\).\n- Total revenue is \\( 40x + 120y = 1200 \\).\n- And \\( x = 2y \\).\n\nBy substituting \\( x = 2y \\) into the revenue equation, we can solve for \\( y \\), and subsequently find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation for the number of small and large animals\nequation1 = Eq(x, 2*y)\n# Equation for the total earnings\nequation2 = Eq(40*x + 120*y, 1200)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (x, y))\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(f\"Number of small stuffed animals sold: {solution[x]}\")\n```\n\nLet's run this Python code to find the solution."

Let's solve the system of equations again and verify the result.\n\nThe equations we set up are:\n1. \\( x = 2y \\) (because twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones were sold).\n2. \\( 40x + 120y = 1200 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2y \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 40(2y) + 120y = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ 80y + 120y = 1200 \\]\n\n\\[ 200y = 1200 \\]\n\nNow solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6 \\]\n\nNow, since \\( x = 2y \\):\n\n\\[ x = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nOkay, the solution provided previously seems correct.
