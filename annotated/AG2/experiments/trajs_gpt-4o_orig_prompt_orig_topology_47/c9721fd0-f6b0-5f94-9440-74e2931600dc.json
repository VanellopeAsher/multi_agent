You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts.

This calculation can be done directly using Python.\n\nHereâ€™s the plan:\n- Calculate the cost of the service fee.\n- Calculate the total cost of labor. Since the company charges based on each hour or fraction of an hour, we'll round up the hours worked to the nearest whole hour.\n- Add the cost of parts.\n- Sum all these costs to get the total bill.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nservice_fee = 40\ncost_per_hour = 35\nhours_worked = 2.25\ncost_of_parts = 60\n\n# Calculate total labor cost\n# Round up to the nearest whole hour\ntotal_hours = math.ceil(hours_worked)\ntotal_labor_cost = total_hours * cost_per_hour\n\n# Total amount billed\ntotal_amount_billed = service_fee + total_labor_cost + cost_of_parts\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_amount_billed)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the total amount billed, rounding the labor time to the nearest whole hour and summing up all the cost components."
