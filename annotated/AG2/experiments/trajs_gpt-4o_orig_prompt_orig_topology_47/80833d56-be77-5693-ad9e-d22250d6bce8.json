You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 100 miles a week.

Then, using this total time and the total distance he covers, we can calculate his average speed.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step using Python.\n\nKey idea:\nThe problem can be solved directly by calculating the total running time and then the average speed. This involves some basic arithmetic which can be easily handled with Python code.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the total hours John runs in a week.\n2. Use the total distance of 100 miles and the total hours to calculate John's average speed in miles per hour (mph).\n\nLet's write the code following these steps:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total time John runs in a week\nfirst_day_hours = 10  # hours John runs on the first day\nother_days_hours = 0.5 * first_day_hours  # hours John runs on the other two days\ntotal_hours = first_day_hours + 2 * other_days_hours  # total hours in the week\n\n# Calculate John's average speed\ntotal_miles = 100  # total miles John runs in a week\naverage_speed = total_miles / total_hours  # speed in miles per hour\n\n# Output the result\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Using Rational to get the fractions instead of decimals\nprint(Rational(average_speed))\n```\n\nThis script calculates John's average speed in miles per hour using fractions. Let's run this code to find the result."

You've correctly determined the average speed.\n\nTo summarize, John runs a total of 15 hours per week (10 hours on the first day and 5 hours cumulatively on the other two days since he runs half the time on each of those days).\n\nThe total distance he covers in a week is 100 miles. Therefore, his average speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{15 \\text{ hours}} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{100}{15} = \\frac{20}{3} \\]\n\nWhich is approximately \\( 5\\frac{2}{3} \\) miles per hour.\n\nIn fraction form, \\(\\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}\\) miles per hour is how fast John runs."
