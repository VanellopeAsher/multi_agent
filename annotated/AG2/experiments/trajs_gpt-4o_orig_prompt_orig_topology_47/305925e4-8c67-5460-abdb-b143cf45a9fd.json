You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJoey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow Case 2 because it's mostly reasoning based. We need to determine how many points Joey has scored and compare it with Marcyâ€™s current score to find out by how many points Joey is winning.\n\n1. Joey's initial score is 214 points.\n2. Let \\( x \\) be the points scored by Joey in his turn. So after his turn, Joey's score is \\( 214 + x \\).\n3. Marcy's initial score is 225 points. After scoring 10 points, her score is \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\).\n\nWe need to find the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score to determine how many points Joey is winning by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = (214 + x) - 235\n\\]\n\nWe want to find \\( 214 + x - 235 \\). Simplifying this expression gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x - 21}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Joey is winning by \\( x - 21 \\) points, where \\( x \\) is the number of points Joey scored in his turn."
