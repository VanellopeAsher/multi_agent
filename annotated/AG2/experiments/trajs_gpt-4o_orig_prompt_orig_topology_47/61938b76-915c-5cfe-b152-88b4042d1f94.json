You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarl purchases ten packages of biscuits.

Calculate the total number of biscuits Carl has.\n2. Calculate the total cost for all the biscuits.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl handed over to find the change.\n\nLet's write the code:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary package\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define variables\nnumber_of_packages = 10\nbiscuits_per_package = 6\nprice_per_biscuit = Rational(1, 10)  # 0.10 is equivalent to 1/10\namount_paid = 10\n\n# Calculate the total number of biscuits\ntotal_biscuits = number_of_packages * biscuits_per_package\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = total_biscuits * price_per_biscuit\n\n# Calculate the change\nchange = amount_paid - total_cost\n\n# Print the change\nprint(change)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will give you Carl's change in fractional form, which is easier to interpret as exact values compared to decimals. Let's see the result:\n\nThe change Carl will get back is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\nThis is because the total cost of the biscuits is $6, and Carl paid with a $10 note, thus receiving $4 back."
