You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the yearly cost of each item Madeline buys for her dog and then sum them up to find the total annual expenditure. We will follow Case 1 and write a Python program to compute this. \n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the yearly cost of food:\n   - Food costs $25 per week.\n   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly food cost is \\(25 \\times 4\\).\n   - There are 12 months in a year, so the yearly food cost is \\(25 \\times 4 \\times 12\\).\n\n2. Calculate the yearly cost of treats:\n   - Treats cost $20 per month.\n   - The yearly treats cost is \\(20 \\times 12\\).\n\n3. Calculate the yearly cost of medicine:\n   - Medicine costs $100 per month.\n   - The yearly medicine cost is \\(100 \\times 12\\).\n\n4. Calculate the yearly cost of a special shampoo:\n   - Shampoo costs $15 per month.\n   - The yearly shampoo cost is \\(15 \\times 12\\).\n\n5. Calculate the yearly cost of toys:\n   - Toys cost $10 every two months, which is \\(10 \\times 6\\) for a year since there are 6 two-month periods in a year.\n\nFinally, sum all the yearly costs to get the total expenditure.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python using the `print` function for the output:\n\n```python\n# Calculate yearly cost components\nfood_cost_per_year = 25 * 4 * 12\ntreats_cost_per_year = 20 * 12\nmedicine_cost_per_year = 100 * 12\nshampoo_cost_per_year = 15 * 12\ntoys_cost_per_year = 10 * 6\n\n# Sum up all yearly costs\ntotal_cost_per_year = (food_cost_per_year +\n                       treats_cost_per_year +\n                       medicine_cost_per_year +\n                       shampoo_cost_per_year +\n                       toys_cost_per_year)\n\n# Print the total yearly cost\nprint(\"The total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year is:\", total_cost_per_year)\n```\n\nThis will provide the total annual expenditure Madeline incurs for her dog."
