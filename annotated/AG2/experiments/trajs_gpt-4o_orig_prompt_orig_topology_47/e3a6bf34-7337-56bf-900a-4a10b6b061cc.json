      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and calculate the total amount John spent on ties. We'll use the following approach:\n\n1. Determine the number of yellow ties John bought.\n2. Calculate the number of green ties and their total cost.\n3. Use the information about red and blue ties to find the number of each and calculate their total cost.\n4. Sum the costs of all types of ties to find the total amount spent.\n\nLet's go through these steps.\n\n### Step 1: Number of Yellow Ties\nJohn spent $300 on yellow ties costing $30 each.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow ties} = \\frac{300}{30} = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Cost of Green Ties\nGreen ties cost 70% more than yellow ties. So, the cost of a green tie is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of a green tie} = 30 + 0.7 \\times 30 = 51\n\\]\n\nAssuming John bought the same number of green ties as yellow, the total cost of green ties is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of green ties} = 10 \\times 51 = 510\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Number of Red and Blue Ties\nLet \\( b \\) be the number of blue ties. Then the number of red ties is \\( 2b \\).\n\nWe have no information on the cost of these ties directly, so let's assume John buys \\( b \\) or \\( 2b \\) such that it fits the budget with the information available. Let's assume logical values and calculate.\n\n### Step 4: Total Cost\nWe'll assume John spent a specific amount on red and blue ties not exceeding the budget. As we're treating it more like a question where assumptions may be needed, let's assume:\n- Cost of one blue tie: $10\n- Cost of red tie (usually the same in assumptions, nothing else given): $10\n\nGiven this, we proceed to calculate:\n\n1. Number of blue ties: \\( b \\)\n2. Number of red ties: \\( 2b \\)\n\nIf \\( b = 5 \\) (a reasonable assumption):\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of blue ties} = 5 \\times 10 = 50\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of red ties} = 2 \\times 5 \\times 10 = 100\n\\]\n\nTotal: \n\n\\[\n600(300 \\text{ for yellow} + 510 \\text{ for green}+ 50\\text{ for blue} + 100 \\text{ for red}\n)\n\n### Final Step: Calculation Consolidation\nTo find the total cost John spent on ties:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of total cost based on the assumptions\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Initialize variables\ncost_yellow = 300  # Given\nnumber_yellow = 10  # as calculated\ncost_green_per_tie = 51  # as calculated\nnumber_green = 10  # same as yellow\ncost_blue_per_tie = 10  # assumed, a reasonable guess for calculation purposes\nnumber_blue = 5  # assumed\ncost_red_per_tie = 10  # assumed\nnumber_red = 2 * number_blue  # per condition\n\n# Total cost calculations\ntotal_cost = cost_yellow + number_green * cost_green_per_tie + \\\n             number_blue * cost_blue_per_tie + number_red * cost_red_per_tie\n\nprint(\"Total cost in USD:\", total_cost)\n```\n\nBy running the above code, we conclude that the total amount John spent on ties is \\(\\boxed{960}\\)."
