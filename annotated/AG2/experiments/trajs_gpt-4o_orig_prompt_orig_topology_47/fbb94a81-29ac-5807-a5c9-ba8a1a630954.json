You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old.

Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:\n   \\[\n   p = u + j\n   \\]\n\nTo find the ages, we can substitute and solve the system of equations.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using `sympy` to handle the symbolic computations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\np, u, j = symbols('p u j')\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\neq1 = Eq(p + u + j, 100)\neq2 = Eq(u, j + 18)\neq3 = Eq(p, u + j)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (p, u, j))\n\n# Extract Peter's age from the solution and print it\npeter_age = solution[p]\nprint(peter_age)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the age of Peter in a symbolic or fractional form, which should lead us to the boxed solution."
