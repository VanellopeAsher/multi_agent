  "problem": "A math teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk to write equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher is environmentally conscious and tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. However, on Monday, the teacher had to conduct an extra class for his students who needed additional help. As a result, he ended up using 45% of the chalk, which was 1.5 times more than his usual consumption. He also noticed that the chalk weighed 0.5 ounces, but this didn't affect his usage. Given that the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches and he plans to return to his usual 20% usage per day, how many days does he have before he needs to recycle this piece of chalk?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rate at which the teacher uses up the chalk and determine how many days it will last before it becomes too small to use (less than 2 inches).\n\nThe key idea here is to:\n1. Determine the initial amount of chalk consumed and remaining after Monday.\n2. Calculate the daily amount of chalk the teacher uses based on his usual consumption rate.\n3. Determine the number of days before the remaining chalk piece becomes smaller than 2 inches.\n\nLet's solve the problem using these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Consumption on Monday:**\n   - The teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk on Monday.\n   - Calculate the amount of chalk used: \\(0.45 \\times 5\\).\n\n2. **Remaining Chalk after Monday:**\n   - Subtract the used chalk from the total: \\(5 - (0.45 \\times 5)\\).\n\n3. **Daily Consumption:**\n   - Usual daily consumption is 20% of the initial 5-inch chalk: \\(0.20 \\times 5\\).\n\n4. **Determine How Many Days Until Chalk is Less Than 2 Inches:**\n   - Use the remaining chalk from step 2.\n   - Calculate how many days the chalk will last by dividing the remaining chalk by the daily usage.\n   - Check how many full days it takes until the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches.\n\nNow, let's translate this into Python code using these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import symbols from sympy for better fraction and radical handling\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial chalk piece length\ninitial_length = 5  # inches\n\n# Chalk consumption rate on Monday\nmonday_consumed_percent = Rational(45, 100)\nmonday_consumed_length = monday_consumed_percent * initial_length\n\n# Remaining chalk after Monday\nremaining_chalk_after_monday = initial_length - monday_consumed_length\n\n# Usual daily consumption rate\ndaily_consumed_percent = Rational(20, 100)\ndaily_consumed_length = daily_consumed_percent * initial_length\n\n# Calculate number of days before chalk is less than 2 inches\ndays = 0\ncurrent_length = remaining_chalk_after_monday\nthreshold_length = 2\n\nwhile current_length > threshold_length:\n    days += 1\n    current_length -= daily_consumed_length\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The teacher can write for {days} more days before needing to recycle the chalk.\")\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we will get the exact number of days the teacher can continue using the chalk, shown directly in \\(\\boxed{}\\)."
