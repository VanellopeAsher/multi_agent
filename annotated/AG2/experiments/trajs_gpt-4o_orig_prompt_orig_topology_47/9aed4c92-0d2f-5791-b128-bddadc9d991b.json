You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark has $50.5 in his bank account.

Calculate the difference between the bike cost and Mark's current savings. This gives the total amount he still needs.\n2. Divide the total amount he needs by his daily earning to find the number of days required.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, ceiling\n\n# Define the variables\ncurrent_savings = 50.5\ndaily_earning = 12.5\nbike_cost = 300.5\n\n# Calculate remaining amount needed\namount_needed = bike_cost - current_savings\n\n# Calculate the number of days needed and use ceiling to round up since he can't work a fraction of a day\ndays = ceiling(amount_needed / daily_earning)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(days)\n```\n\nThis code calculates and prints the number of days Mark needs to work to afford the bike, rounding up to the nearest whole number since he must work a complete day to earn his daily wage."
