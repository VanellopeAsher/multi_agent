You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month.

Aleena pays $200 per month for the first half of the year, which is 6 months. \n2. For the second half of the year, she pays 15% less, which means she pays 85% of the original price for the next 6 months.\n\nWe'll calculate these two components and sum them to find the total payment made over the entire year.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Subscription cost for the first half of the year\nmonthly_rate = 200\nfirst_half_total = 6 * monthly_rate\n\n# Subscription cost for the second half of the year with 15% discount\ndiscount_rate = 0.15\nadjusted_monthly_rate = monthly_rate * (1 - discount_rate)\nsecond_half_total = 6 * adjusted_monthly_rate\n\n# Total annual subscription cost\ntotal_payment = first_half_total + second_half_total\n\n# Output the total amount using fractions\nprint(Rational(total_payment))\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total payment considering both halves of the year, applying the appropriate discount for the second half, and finally prints out the total using a Rational representation."
