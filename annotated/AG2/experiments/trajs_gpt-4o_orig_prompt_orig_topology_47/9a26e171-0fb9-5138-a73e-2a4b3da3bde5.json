You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home.

Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home.\n2. 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this number represents one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer at home.\n\nThe key idea is to set up equations based on the given conditions and solve them step by step.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( T \\) as the total number of students in that grade level.\n- \\( D \\) as the number of students who have desktop computers.\n- \\( N \\) as the number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer.\n\nBased on the information given:\n- \\( D = \\frac{3}{4}T \\)\n- 20 students do not have desktop computers.\n- 20 students = \\(\\frac{1}{3}N\\)\n\nFrom the equations above, we have two unknowns, \\(T\\) and \\(N\\). We can express everything in terms of \\(T\\).\n\nThe number of students who do not have desktop computers is \\( T - D \\). Given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, we have:\n\\[ T - D = 20 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( D = \\frac{3}{4}T \\) into the equation:\n\\[ T - \\frac{3}{4}T = 20 \\]\n\nLet's solve the equation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Rational\n\nT = symbols('T', positive=True, integer=True)\nD = Rational(3, 4) * T\nequation = T - D - 20\n\n# Solve for total number of students T\ntotal_students = solve(equation, T)\nprint(total_students[0])  # Total number of students\n```\n\nRun the above code to find the total number of students \\( T \\).

If there are 80 students in total, according to the problem, three-fourths of them have desktop computers:\n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 80 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, 60 students have desktop computers.\n\n2. Therefore, the number of students who do not have desktop computers is:\n   \\[\n   80 - 60 = 20\n   \\]\n   which matches the given information that 20 students do not have desktop computers.\n\n3.
