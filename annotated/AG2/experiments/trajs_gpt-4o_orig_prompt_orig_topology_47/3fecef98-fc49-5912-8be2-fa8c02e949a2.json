You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed.

Calculate the dimensions of the comforter:\n   - The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.\n   - The comforter needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\n\n2. Calculate the area of fabric for the comforter:\n   - Use the dimensions calculated for the comforter to find its area.\n\n3. Calculate the area of fabric for the duvet cover:\n   - Use the given dimensions of the duvet cover (9 feet by 11 feet) to find its area.\n\n4. Sum the areas to find the total fabric required.\n\nWe can use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary package\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the dimensions\nbed_length = 6\nbed_width = 8\ncomforter_length = bed_length + 2\ncomforter_width = bed_width + 2\n\n# Calculate the area of the comforter\ncomforter_area = comforter_length * comforter_width\n\n# Define the dimensions of the duvet cover\nduvet_length = 9\nduvet_width = 11\n\n# Calculate the area of the duvet cover\nduvet_area = duvet_length * duvet_width\n\n# Calculate the total area of fabric needed\ntotal_area = comforter_area + duvet_area\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_area)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total square feet of fabric that Jim needs to buy."
