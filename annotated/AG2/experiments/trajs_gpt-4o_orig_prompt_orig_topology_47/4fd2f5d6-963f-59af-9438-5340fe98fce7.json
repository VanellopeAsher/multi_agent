The key idea here is that Ethan saves 20% on his costs by making his own hand-painted wallpaper compared to the amount it would cost if he bought a pre-made one.\n\nLet's introduce some variables:\n- Let \\( C \\) be the total cost if Ethan bought pre-made wallpaper.\n- Let \\( M \\) be the materials cost for making his own wallpaper.\n- Let \\( T \\) be the total cost for making his own wallpaper.\n\nThe problem states that making his own wallpaper saves 20% of the total costs compared to buying it. In equation form:\n\n\\[\nT = C - 0.2C\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( T \\) is made up of purely the materials cost in this case, we have:\n\\[\nT = M\n\\]\n\nWe need additional context or numbers to find any actual numerical values, but since it seems like we're interested in a formulaic understanding of how the cost savings work, we can express \\( T \\) as a fraction of \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\nT = 0.8 \\cdot C\n\\]\n\nWithout specific numbers given for \\( C \\) or \\( M \\), this is the simplified expression we can derive based on the problem statement.\n\nIf additional details are provided (such as the actual cost of the pre-made wallpaper or materials costs), please let me know, and we can calculate precise numerical values using this approach."

      "content": "To solve this problem step by step, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the given context. The main assumption here is that the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper (\\( T \\)) is equivalent to the materials cost, given that the savings are solely due to making it oneself.\n\n1. **Identify the relationship between costs**:\n   - Total cost if pre-made: \\( C \\)\n   - Materials cost for DIY: \\( M = T = 0.8 \\times C \\)\n\n2. Since we do not have explicit numbers for \\( C \\) or \\( M \\), we'll use the relationship derived:\n   - \\( M = 0.8 \\times C \\)\n\nGiven this, we don't have specific numbers to evaluate unless we are provided with either \\( C \\) or \\( M \\). If you have either of these values, you can substitute it into the formula \\( M = 0.8 \\times C \\) to find the other.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide these numbers, we have reached the final expression indicating the cost relationship:\n\n\\[ \nM = 0.8 \\times C \n\\]\n\nThis is the formula to calculate how much the total cost \\( M \\) actually is when Ethan decides to make his own wallpaper, assuming full savings of 20% are realized via material costs alone.\n\nIf additional context or specific values are given, please share, and we can proceed to calculate exact costs. Otherwise, the solution is primarily formulaic."

However, since no specific numbers are given, we'll consider hypothetical scenarios and enumerate potential costs.\n\n### Hypothetical Scenario:\nLet's assume the cost for pre-made wallpaper \\( C = x \\). Then, given that 20% is saved, the cost for making the wallpaper is:\n\n\\[ \nM = 0.8 \\times x \n\\]\n\nTo express it in another form, define the savings formula:\n\n- Cost savings = \\( 0.2 \\times x \\)\n- Total DIY cost: \\( M = x - \\text{Cost savings} = x - 0.2x = 0.8x \\)\n\nThis verifies that:\n\n\\[ \nM = 0.8x \n\\]\n\nGiven values or external reality checks are not presented, therefore the problem is limited to expressing the percentage savings through mathematical terms.\n\nIf further specifics or values are not provided, the answer becomes illustrative based on the savings logic derived:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{M = 0.8C}\n\\]\n\nThis expression encapsulates the cost based on the stipulated 20% savings when making wallpaper oneself. Any value of \\( C \\) would just need a substitution to find \\( M \\). If numbers are given, we can easily substitute and compute actual costs."
