You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the relationship between the mean and the sum of the scores. We know the mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers.\n\nGiven Sally received the scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and one more forgotten score, and the mean score is 70, we can use the formula for the mean:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of scores}}{\\text{Number of scores}}\n\\]\n\nThe number of scores is 9 since there are 8 known scores and 1 forgotten score. Thus:\n\n\\[\n70 = \\frac{50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + x}{9}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( x \\) is the forgotten score. We can solve for \\( x \\) by rearranging the equation.\n\nLet's use Python to solve for the forgotten score:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Score variables\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Scores list\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# Equation for mean\nmean_score = 70\nnum_scores = len(scores) + 1 # Including the forgotten score\n\n# Mean equation\nequation = Eq(sum(scores) + x, mean_score * num_scores)\n\n# Solve for the forgotten score\nforgotten_score = solve(equation, x)[0]\nprint(forgotten_score)\n```\nWhen you run this code, it will provide the value of the forgotten score. It calculates the total sum of known scores, uses the mean equation, and isolates the forgotten score. The solution should be wrapped in \\(\\boxed{}\\)."
