You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

      "content": "Key idea: The problem involves a sequence of growth events where the beanstalk's height changes over time. We can model the beanstalk's height using mathematical operations based on the given description. This can be directly solved using simple arithmetic calculations in Python.\n\nLet's assume the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week is \\( h \\) inches.\n\n1. After the first week, the height of the beanstalk is \\( h \\) inches.\n2. After the second week, the height is doubled, so the height becomes \\( 2h \\) inches.\n3. After the third week, it grows an additional 4 inches, making the final height \\( 2h + 4 \\) inches.\n\nNow, we can write a Python program to output this expression:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Let the initial height of the beanstalk be h inches\nh = symbols('h')\n\n# Calculate the final height after 3 weeks\nfinal_height = 2 * h + 4\n\n# Print the final height\nprint(simplify(final_height))\n```\n\nThe program above will print the expression for the beanstalk's height in terms of \\( h \\) after the end of 3 weeks. Since we do not have a specific value for \\( h \\), the answer will remain in this general form."
