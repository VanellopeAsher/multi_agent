  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

Let's proceed with the solution.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nCase 1 applies here since this problem can be straightforwardly solved using algebra and basic Python calculations. We will formulate and solve an algebraic equation.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( T \\) as the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know:\n- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at \\$60 each and 4 car tires at \\$40 each.\n- On Friday, only car tires are repaired.\n\nThe money earned on each day is:\n- Thursday earnings = \\(6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40\\)\n- Friday earnings = \\(T \\times 40\\)\n\nAccording to the problem, the mechanic earns \\$40 more on Thursday than on Friday:\n\\[ 6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40 = T \\times 40 + 40 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( T \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Earnings on Thursday\nthursday_earnings = 6 * 60 + 4 * 40\n\n# Earnings on Friday\nfriday_earnings = T * 40\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(thursday_earnings, friday_earnings + 40)\n\n# Solve the equation\nnumber_of_car_tires_friday = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_car_tires_friday)\n```\n\nRun the above code to find the number of car tires repaired on Friday.
