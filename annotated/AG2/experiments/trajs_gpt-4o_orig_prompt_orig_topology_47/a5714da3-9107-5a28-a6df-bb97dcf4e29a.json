You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost by adding up the individual costs of each item Scarlett bought.\n\nKey idea: We will add the costs of the aquarium, the rocks, the coral, the fish, and the fish food to find the total amount spent. This falls under Case 1, as it can be directly calculated using Python.\n\nHere is the Python code for calculating this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs\naquarium_price = Rational(10, 1)\nrocks_price = 2 * Rational(5, 2)  # 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each\ncoral_price = 3 * Rational(2, 1)  # 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each\nfish_price = 20 * Rational(0, 1)  # 20 fish assumed to be free as no cost mentioned\nfish_food_price = Rational(2, 1)  # Fish food costs $2.00\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = aquarium_price + rocks_price + coral_price + fish_price + fish_food_price\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n1. Aquarium: $10.00\n2. Rocks: 2 bags * $2.50 = $5.00\n3. Coral: 3 pieces * $2.00 = $6.00\n4. Fish: 20 * $0.00 = $0.00\n5. Fish food: $2.00\n\nTotal cost = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $0.00 + $2.00 = $23.00\n\nThus, the total amount Scarlett spent is \\(\\boxed{23}\\)."
