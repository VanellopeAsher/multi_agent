You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels.

      "content": "To find the average height of heels at the cocktail party, we can solve this problem using a Python program. This is because we are dealing with a straightforward calculation that involves averaging numbers.\n\nThe key idea is to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women wearing heels to find the average height.\n\nHere's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total height contributed by the women wearing 4.5-inch heels.\n2. Calculate the total height contributed by the women wearing 2.5-inch heels.\n3. Add these two totals to get the overall height.\n4. Divide the overall height by the total number of women to find the average height.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of women wearing 4.5-inch heels\nnum_women_4_5 = 3\n# Height of 4.5-inch heels in inches\nheight_4_5 = Rational(9, 2)\n\n# Number of women wearing 2.5-inch heels\nnum_women_2_5 = 3\n# Height of 2.5-inch heels in inches\nheight_2_5 = Rational(5, 2)\n\n# Total height from 4.5-inch heels\ntotal_height_4_5 = num_women_4_5 * height_4_5\n\n# Total height from 2.5-inch heels\ntotal_height_2_5 = num_women_2_5 * height_2_5\n\n# Overall total height of heels\noverall_total_height = total_height_4_5 + total_height_2_5\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = num_women_4_5 + num_women_2_5\n\n# Average height of heels\naverage_height = overall_total_height / total_women\n\n# Print the average height\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the average height of heels at the party in fraction form. Let's proceed to find the average height."

The total height contributed by the women wearing 4.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{27}{2}\\).\n2. The total height contributed by the women wearing 2.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}\\).\n3. The overall total height is \\(\\frac{27}{2} + \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{42}{2}\\).\n4.
