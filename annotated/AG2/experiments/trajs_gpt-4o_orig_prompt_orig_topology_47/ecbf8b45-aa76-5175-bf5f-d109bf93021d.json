You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balloons that were thrown during the water balloon fight. Here is the key idea:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of balloons they started with.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end to find out how many were thrown.\n\nLet's assume they started with \\( n \\) packs of balloons. Since each pack contains 30 balloons, the total number of balloons they started with is \\( 30n \\). At the end, 12 balloons are left. Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is \\( 30n - 12 \\).\n\nSince the problem does not provide the exact number of packs used, we can't calculate the exact number of balloons thrown using just the information provided. Therefore, we will represent the answer in terms of \\( n \\).\n\nHere is the solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the symbol for number of packs\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Equation to solve: Total thrown balloons = total balloons - remaining balloons\ntotal_thrown = 30*n - 12\n\n# Print the expression for the total number of thrown balloons\nprint(total_thrown)\n```\n\nThis will give the expression for the number of balloons they threw in terms of \\( n \\). If you provide the number of packs, I can calculate the numeric value for you."

If you know the specific number of packs \\( n \\) that were used, we can substitute that value to get the exact number of balloons thrown.\n\nFor example, if they used \\( n = 5 \\) packs, you would substitute \\( n \\) into the expression to find the number of balloons thrown:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 5 - 12 = 150 - 12 = 138\n\\]\n\nIf you provide the number of packs, I can compute the exact number for you.
