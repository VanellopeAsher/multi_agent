  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We'll consider the cost of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey alone, since the secret ingredient (water) is free.\n\nWe'll use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of ingredients to make 10 jars.\n2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nLet's write a Python program to do these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Import the sympy package\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the quantities and prices\npassion_fruit_cost_per_pound = Rational(6)  # $6 per pound\njackfruit_cost_per_pound = Rational(8)      # $8 per pound\nhoney_cost_per_pound = Rational(10)         # $10 per pound\n\npassion_fruit_per_jar = Rational(2)         # pounds per jar\njackfruit_per_jar = Rational(1.5)           # pounds per jar\nhoney_per_jar = Rational(2)                 # pounds per jar\n\njars_sold = 10\nprice_per_jar = Rational(50)  # $50 per jar\n\n# Calculate cost per jar\ncost_per_jar = (passion_fruit_cost_per_pound * passion_fruit_per_jar +\n                jackfruit_cost_per_pound * jackfruit_per_jar +\n                honey_cost_per_pound * honey_per_jar)\n\n# Calculate total cost for 10 jars\ntotal_cost = cost_per_jar * jars_sold\n\n# Calculate total revenue\ntotal_revenue = price_per_jar * jars_sold\n\n# Calculate profit\nprofit = total_revenue - total_cost\n\n# Print the profit\nprint(profit)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the result for the profit Tim makes by selling 10 jars of his special mixture."
