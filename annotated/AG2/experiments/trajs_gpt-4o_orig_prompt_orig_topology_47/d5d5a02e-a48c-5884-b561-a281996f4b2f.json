You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll model the scenario using algebra. We need to translate the given conditions into equations and solve them to find the present ages of Emil's dad and brother.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the current age of Emil's dad.\n   - Let \\( b \\) be the current age of Emil's brother.\n\n2. **Set up Equations:**\n   - When Emil turns 26, the age difference between him and his dad remains the same. So, \\( d + 5 = 2 \\times 26 \\), because Emil's age at that time will be half of his dad's age.\n   - When Emil turns 26, the age difference between him and his brother will also remain the same. So, \\( b + 5 = \\frac{26}{2} \\), because Emil's age at that time will be twice the age of his brother.\n\n3. **Solve the Equations:**\n   - From the second condition, \\( d + 5 = 52 \\).\n   - From the third condition, \\( b + 5 = 13 \\).\n\nNow, let's write Python code using `sympy` to solve these equations and find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nd, b = symbols('d b', integer=True)\n\n# Setup the equations based on the given conditions\nequation1 = Eq(d + 5, 52)  # When Emil is 26, dad's age is double that\nequation2 = Eq(b + 5, 13)  # When Emil is 26, brother's age is half of Emil's age\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (d, b))\n\n# Calculate the sum of their current ages\nsum_of_ages = solution[d] + solution[b]\nprint(sum_of_ages)\n```\n\nOnce you run the code, you'll find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother at present. Since I can't run the code, I will guide you to run it in your environment. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
