  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "First, we need to find out the total amount of time John spent on activities. This problem can be solved directly with Python, as we'll perform calculations using the provided percentages and times.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Determine the time spent on each activity.\n2. Calculate the total time spent on activities, excluding breaks and lunch.\n3. Use the percentage given for sightseeing to calculate the time spent on sightseeing.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Time spent on different activities\nboating_time = 6  # hours\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2  # half of boating time, so 3 hours\nshows_time = 3 * 2  # 3 shows, 2 hours each, so 6 hours\n\n# Total time spent on activities is 30% of the total time\ntotal_activities_time = (boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time) / 0.3\n\n# Sightseeing time is 40% of the total time\nsightseeing_time = total_activities_time * 0.4\n\nfrom sympy import Rational\nsightseeing_time_rational = Rational(sightseeing_time).limit_denominator()\n\n# Output the time spent on sightseeing in a fraction\nprint(sightseeing_time_rational)\n```\n\nRun this code to get the answer. The program will output the time John spent on sightseeing in the form of a fraction."
