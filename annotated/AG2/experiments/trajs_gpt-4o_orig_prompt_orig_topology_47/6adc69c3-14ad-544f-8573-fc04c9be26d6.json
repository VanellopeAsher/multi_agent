You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

Each of these 4 parts is further cut into 5 equal parts.\n3. Each of these final pieces must be 5 cm long.\n\nWe want to find the total length of the ribbon. Let's denote the original length of the ribbon as \\( L \\).\n\n- After the first cut, each of the 4 parts has a length of \\( \\frac{L}{4} \\).\n- When each part is cut into 5 equal parts, each smaller part has a length of \\( \\frac{L}{4 \\times 5} = \\frac{L}{20} \\).\n- We know that each of these smaller parts is 5 cm long, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L}{20} = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation to find the length \\( L \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Eq, solve, symbols\n\n# Define L as the length of the original ribbon\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Equation based on the problem description\nequation = Eq(L / 20, 5)\n\n# Solve for L\nlength_of_ribbon = solve(equation, L)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(length_of_ribbon)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the length of the ribbon."
