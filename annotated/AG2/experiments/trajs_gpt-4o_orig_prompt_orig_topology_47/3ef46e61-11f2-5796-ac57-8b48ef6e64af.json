You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

This problem can be solved directly using Python, so let's follow Case 1 and write a program to solve it.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Compute the number of working minutes for each day from Monday to Thursday.\n2. Compute the number of working minutes on Friday.\n3. Add up all these minutes to get the total working minutes for the week.\n4. Divide the total minutes by the time it takes to handle one call (15 minutes) to get the number of calls handled in a week.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Total hours worked from Monday to Thursday\nhours_per_day = 6\ndays_monday_to_thursday = 4\nminutes_per_hour = 60\n\n# Total minutes worked from Monday to Thursday\ntotal_minutes_monday_to_thursday = hours_per_day * minutes_per_hour * days_monday_to_thursday\n\n# Total hours worked on Friday (including extra hours)\nhours_on_friday = 6 + 2  # additional 2 hours\ntotal_minutes_on_friday = hours_on_friday * minutes_per_hour\n\n# Total working minutes in a week\ntotal_working_minutes = total_minutes_monday_to_thursday + total_minutes_on_friday\n\n# Minutes per call\nminutes_per_call = 15\n\n# Total number of calls handled in a week\ntotal_calls_handled = total_working_minutes // minutes_per_call\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(total_calls_handled)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the result."
