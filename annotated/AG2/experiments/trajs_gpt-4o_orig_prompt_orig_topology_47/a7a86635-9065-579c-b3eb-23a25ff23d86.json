      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl. Let's break the problem down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - There are 200 kids in total, divided equally into boys and girls. Therefore, there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n   - Each boy brings back 600 shells. Thus, the total number of shells brought by the boys is \\( 100 \\times 600 = 60,000 \\) shells.\n   - The problem states that the girls brought a total amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times that amount. \n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Shells Brought by the Girls:**\n   - If the number of shells brought by the boys is 60,000, then the total number of shells brought by the girls is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total shells by girls} = 60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 5 \\times 60,000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Shells Brought by Each Girl:**\n   - Since there are 100 girls, the number of shells brought by each girl is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5 \\times 60,000}{100}\n     \\]\n\nNow let's calculate it using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the known quantities\nboys_shells = 600\ntotal_boys = 100\ntotal_girls = 100\n\n# Total shells brought by the boys\ntotal_shells_boys = boys_shells * total_boys\n\n# Total shells brought by the girls\ntotal_shells_girls = total_shells_boys + 4 * total_shells_boys\n\n# Shells brought by each girl\nshells_per_girl = total_shells_girls / total_girls\n\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nThe result will give us the number of shells brought by each girl. Once you run this code, you should find that the number of shells brought by each girl is \\(\\boxed{3000}\\)."
