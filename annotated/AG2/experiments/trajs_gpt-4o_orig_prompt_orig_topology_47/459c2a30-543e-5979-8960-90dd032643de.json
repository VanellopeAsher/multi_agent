You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

There are 14 red squares.\n2. There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.\n3. There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.\n\nLet's calculate the number of blue and green squares first, and then use this information to find the number of white squares.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\nLet's use Python with the `sympy` package to calculate these values symbolically. We'll set up equations for each color and ensure the total matches the quilt's size.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nR, B, G, W = symbols('R B G W')\n\n# Constraints based on the problem description\neq1 = Eq(R, 14)  # 14 red squares\neq2 = Eq(B, R + 4)  # 4 more blue squares than red squares\neq3 = Eq(G, B + 6)  # 6 more green squares than blue squares\neq4 = Eq(R + B + G + W, 68)  # Total number of squares is 68\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolutions = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4), (R, B, G, W))\nR_value = solutions[R]\nB_value = solutions[B]\nG_value = solutions[G]\nW_value = solutions[W]\n\n# Calculate the difference between green and white squares\ndifference = G_value - W_value\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The number of fewer white squares than green squares is: {difference}\")\n```\n\nThe code should provide us the difference in the count of white squares compared to green squares. Let's execute the steps to find the difference."
