You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16.

Given the problem, we need to determine Charmaine's current age from the fact that in 12 years she will be 16. Then, we will calculate how old she will be in 4 years from now.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Find Charmaine's current age by solving the equation for her age in 12 years.\n2. Calculate her age in 4 years by adding 4 to her current age.\n\nLet's follow Case 1 and write a Python program to solve it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for Charmaine's current age\ncurrent_age = symbols('current_age')\n\n# Equation: In 12 years, Charmaine will be 16\nequation = Eq(current_age + 12, 16)\n\n# Solve for current age\nage_now = solve(equation, current_age)[0]\n\n# Calculate her age in 4 years\nage_in_4_years = age_now + 4\n\n# Output the result\nprint(age_in_4_years)\n```\n\nThis program will give us Charmaine's age after 4 years."

We can express this as:\n   \\[\n   x + 12 = 16\n   \\]\n2. Solving for \\( x \\) (Charmaine's current age):\n   \\[\n   x = 16 - 12 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3.
