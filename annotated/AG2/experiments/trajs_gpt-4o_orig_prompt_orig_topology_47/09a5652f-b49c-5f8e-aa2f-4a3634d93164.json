You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

Calculate the total hours John runs in a week.\n2. Use the total distance and total time to calculate the running speed.\n\nWe can perform these calculations directly using a Python program.\n\n```python\n# Total miles John runs in a week\ntotal_miles = 60\n\n# Time spent running each day\ntime_day1 = 3  # hours\ntime_day2 = time_day3 = time_day1 / 2  # hours\n\n# Total time spent running in a week\ntotal_time = time_day1 + time_day2 + time_day3\n\n# Calculate average speed\nspeed = total_miles / total_time\n\n# Print the result using a fraction\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(f\"Running speed: {Rational(speed)} miles per hour\")\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find out John's running speed."
