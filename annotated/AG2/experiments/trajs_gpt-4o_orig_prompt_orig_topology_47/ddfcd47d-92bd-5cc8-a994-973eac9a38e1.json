You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia.

Calculate the initial amount of money each person has.\n2. Sum the total amount of money and divide it equally among the three people.\n\nLet's proceed to solve the problem using Python in the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate Kassidy's amount from Aurelia's known amount.\n2. Use Kassidy's amount to determine Rayna's amount.\n3. Sum up the total money and determine the equal share for each person.\n\nHere's the code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Aurelia has $150\naurelia = 150\n\n# Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia\nkassidy = Rational(2, 3) * aurelia\n\n# Rayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy\nrayna = kassidy + 70\n\n# Total money\ntotal_money = aurelia + kassidy + rayna\n\n# Each person's share if divided equally\nequal_share = total_money / 3\n\n# Print the results in fraction form\nprint(\"Aurelia's amount: $\", aurelia)\nprint(\"Kassidy's amount: ${}\".format(kassidy))\nprint(\"Rayna's amount: ${}\".format(rayna))\nprint(\"Total money: ${}\".format(total_money))\nprint(\"Each person would have: ${}\".format(equal_share))\n```\n\nLet's compute this."
