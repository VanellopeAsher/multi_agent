  "problem": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the cost of each type of item in Kelly's cart and then determine the total amount spent. Finally, we'll subtract the total amount spent from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe can directly solve this problem using a Python program to perform arithmetic calculations for the prices of the items.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the price of one pack of bacon.\n2. Use the bacon price to calculate the price per packet of chicken because each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\n3. Calculate the total cost for strawberries.\n4. Calculate the price per pack of apples using the price of strawberries.\n5. Sum up the total cost of all items.\n6. Subtract the total cost from the budget to find the remaining amount.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to execute these steps.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# 1. Calculate the price of one pack of bacon\ntotal_bacon_cost = Rational(21, 2)  # $10.5 in fractions\nbacon_packs = 5\nprice_per_bacon = total_bacon_cost / bacon_packs\n\n# 2. Calculate the price per packet of chicken\nprice_per_chicken = 2 * price_per_bacon\n\n# 3. Calculate the total cost for strawberries\nstrawberry_packs = 3\nprice_per_strawberry = Rational(9, 2)  # $4.5\ntotal_strawberry_cost = strawberry_packs * price_per_strawberry\n\n# 4. Calculate the price per pack of apples\nprice_per_apple = price_per_strawberry / 2\n\n# 5. Sum all costs\ntotal_bacon_cost = total_bacon_cost  # already calculated\ntotal_chicken_cost = 6 * price_per_chicken\ntotal_apple_cost = 7 * price_per_apple\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = total_bacon_cost + total_chicken_cost + total_strawberry_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# 6. Calculate remaining budget\nbudget = 65\nremaining_budget = Rational(budget) - total_cost\n\n# Print the remaining money in budget\nprint(remaining_budget)\n```\n\nRunning this code will calculate how much money Kelly has left in her budget."
