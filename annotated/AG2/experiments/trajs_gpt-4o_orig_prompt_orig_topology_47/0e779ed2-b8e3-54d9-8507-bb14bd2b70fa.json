You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the sisters' age:**\n   - Since all the sisters are the same age and their age is 1.6 times ten, we know each sister is \\( 1.6 \\times 10 = 16 \\) years old.\n\n2. **Calculate the age of one brother:**\n   - One of the brothers is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of 20 years old, which is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 = 12 \\) years old.\n\n3. **Calculate the age of the older brother:**\n   - The older brother is twice as old as the younger brother, so his age is \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**\n   - There are 3 sisters each 16 years old, so their total age is \\( 3 \\times 16 \\).\n   - Add the ages of both brothers to get the total.\n\nLet's calculate the total age using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the ages\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10\nyoung_brother_age = Rational(3, 5) * 20\nolder_brother_age = 2 * young_brother_age\n\n# Calculate total age\ntotal_age = 3 * sister_age + young_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\n# Output the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the total age of all siblings in a fraction or exact form as needed.
