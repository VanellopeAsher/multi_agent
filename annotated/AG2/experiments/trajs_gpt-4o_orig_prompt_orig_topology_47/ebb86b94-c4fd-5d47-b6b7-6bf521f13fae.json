You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nReggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran together. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. How many miles did Lynn run?"

However, the problem does not provide enough data to ascertain the distance Lynn ran. Therefore, either the problem statement is missing some information, or Lynn's distance is independent of the given data. \n\nLet's summarize:\n- Paisley ran 4 miles.\n- Reggie ran \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) miles.\n\nWithout additional information on any conditions or constraints regarding Lynn's distance, we can't derive an answer with the given data.\n\nIf there was a condition or statement specifying a particular relationship for Lynn's distance compared to Paisley or Reggie's running distance (for example, \"Lynn ran the same distance as Paisley\" or \"Lynn ran the same total distance as Reggie and Paisley combined\"), we would use it to find the solution. \n\nPlease verify if there is additional information about Lynn's running that should be considered."

Paisley ran 4 miles.\n2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) miles.\n\nWithout any clear instructions or relationships regarding how much Lynn ran, it stands unspecified in our current context.
