You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

Letâ€™s follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - There are 20 kids in total, divided into equal groups of girls and boys, meaning there are 10 girls and 10 boys.\n   - Each boy brought back 60 shells.\n   - The total number of shells brought by the boys: \\(10 \\text{ boys} \\times 60 \\text{ shells/boy} = 600 \\text{ shells}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Shells Brought by Girls:**\n   - The problem states that the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many shells as the boys.\n   - This means the total number of shells the girls brought back is:\n   \\[\n   600 + 4.5 \\times 600\n   \\]\n\n3. **Develop a Formula for Each Girl:**\n   - To find how many shells were brought by each girl, divide the total shells the girls brought by the number of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shells per girl} = \\frac{600 + 4.5 \\times 600}{10}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total shells brought by the boys\nshells_boys = 10 * 60\n\n# Calculate the additional shells brought by the girls\nadditional_girls = Rational(9, 2) * shells_boys\n\n# Calculate total shells brought by girls\ntotal_girls_shells = shells_boys + additional_girls\n\n# Calculate shells brought by each girl\nshells_per_girl = total_girls_shells / 10\n\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nExecute the code to find the number of seashells brought by each girl."
