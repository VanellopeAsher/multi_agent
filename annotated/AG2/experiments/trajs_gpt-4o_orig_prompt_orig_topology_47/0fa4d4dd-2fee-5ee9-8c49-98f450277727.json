      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy.\n2. Calculate the amount of money Sara has saved initially and from babysitting.\n3. Determine how much more money is needed and calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn enough.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.**\n   - Jacket cost: $120\n   - Shoes cost: 2 pairs × $100 each = $200\n   - Total cost = $120 + $200 = $320\n\n2. **Calculate the money Sara has initially and from babysitting.**\n   - Initial savings: $100\n   - Babysitting earnings: 10 times × $5 each time = $50\n   - Total money from savings and babysitting = $100 + $50 = $150\n\n3. **Determine how much more money she needs.**\n   - Additional money needed = Total cost - Total money from savings and babysitting\n   - Additional money needed = $320 - $150 = $170\n\n4. **Calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn.**\n   - She earns $10 each time she mows the lawn.\n   - Number of times to mow the lawn = Additional money needed / Earnings per mowing\n   - Number of times to mow the lawn = $170 / $10 = 17\n\nThus, Sara must mow the lawn 17 times. Let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given values\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost_per_pair = 100\nshoe_pairs = 2\ninitial_savings = 100\nbabysitting_earnings_per_time = 5\nbabysitting_times = 10\nmowing_earnings_per_time = 10\n\n# Calculations\ntotal_cost = jacket_cost + (shoe_cost_per_pair * shoe_pairs)\ntotal_earnings = initial_savings + (babysitting_earnings_per_time * babysitting_times)\nadditional_needed = total_cost - total_earnings\nmowing_times_needed = additional_needed / mowing_earnings_per_time\n\n# Output the result\nprint(mowing_times_needed)\n```\n\nRunning this program will show that Sara must mow the lawn 17 times. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]"

However, since we are counting the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn, it should be an integer. In this context, the number of times is indeed 17. \n\nTo ensure the result is presented as an integer, let's slightly adjust the Python code to print an integer:\n\n```python\n# Given values\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost_per_pair = 100\nshoe_pairs = 2\ninitial_savings = 100\nbabysitting_earnings_per_time = 5\nbabysitting_times = 10\nmowing_earnings_per_time = 10\n\n# Calculations\ntotal_cost = jacket_cost + (shoe_cost_per_pair * shoe_pairs)\ntotal_earnings = initial_savings + (babysitting_earnings_per_time * babysitting_times)\nadditional_needed = total_cost - total_earnings\nmowing_times_needed = additional_needed // mowing_earnings_per_time\n\n# Output the result\nprint(mowing_times_needed)\n```\n\nThe correct number of times Sara must mow the lawn is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]"
