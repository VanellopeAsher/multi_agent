      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the work rate for one individual, determine the combined work rate for a team of 5 individuals, and then compute the total time required for the team to paint an entire house.\n\n**Key Idea:** This problem can be solved with direct calculations using Python.\n\n1. First, determine the work rate of one individual.\n2. Then, calculate the combined work rate for 5 individuals.\n3. Finally, find the total time it takes for the team to complete the task in hours.\n\nLet's perform these calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. A single individual can paint half a house in 5 days. So, in one day, they can paint \\( \\frac{1}{2 \\times 5} = \\frac{1}{10} \\) of a house.\n2. The combined work rate of 5 individuals is 5 times the work rate of one individual: \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a house per day.\n3. To complete painting one entire house, given their combined work rate of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) house per day, it would take them \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \\) days.\n\n4. Since each day has 24 hours, the total number of hours required is \\( 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\) hours.\n\nLet's use Python to confirm these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the work rate of a single individual\nindividual_rate = 1 / 10  # fraction of house per day\n\n# Calculate the combined work rate for 5 individuals\nteam_rate = 5 * individual_rate  # fraction of house per day\n\n# Calculate the total number of days needed to paint the entire house\ndays_needed = 1 / team_rate  # number of days to paint 1 house\n\n# Convert the total number of days to hours\nhours_needed = days_needed * 24\n\n# Print the result\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(hours_needed))\n```\n\nUsing the above code, we confirm the calculation and present the answer as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\] \nhours for the team of 5 individuals to paint the entire house."

      "content": "Certainly! It looks like we've already solved the problem in full. However, let's quickly recap the steps and confirm the final answer to ensure completeness:\n\n1. **Individual Work Rate:** A single individual can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, their daily work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of a house per day.\n\n2. **Combined Work Rate for Team:** With 5 individuals, the combined daily work rate is \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a house per day.\n\n3. **Time to Paint One House:** To paint a full house, the team needs \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \\) days.\n\n4. **Convert Days to Hours:** Since each day is 24 hours, the total time in hours is \\( 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\).\n\nThus, converting the necessary time into hours, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]\nThis confirms that it takes 48 hours for a team of 5 individuals to paint the entire house.
