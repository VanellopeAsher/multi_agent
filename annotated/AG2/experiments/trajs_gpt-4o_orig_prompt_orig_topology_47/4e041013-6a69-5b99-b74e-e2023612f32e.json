You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden.

This falls under Case 1.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the number of rows needed for the 36 red tulips, knowing he can place 6 red tulips per row.\n2. Calculate the number of rows needed for the 24 blue tulips, knowing he can place 8 blue tulips per row.\n3. Add the rows needed for each color to get the total number of rows.\n\nLet's use Python to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of tulips and their arrangement capacity\nred_tulips = 36\nred_per_row = 6\n\nblue_tulips = 24\nblue_per_row = 8\n\n# Calculate number of rows for each color\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_per_row\n\n# Total number of rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nRun this code to get the number of rows Jackson will plant."
