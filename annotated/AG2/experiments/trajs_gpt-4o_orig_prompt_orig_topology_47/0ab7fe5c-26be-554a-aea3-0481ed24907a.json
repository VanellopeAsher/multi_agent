Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll determine the number of rows Jackson will plant for each color separately, then add them together. \n\n**Key Idea: Case 1**\n\nSince we can directly compute the number of rows based on the given quantities of tulips, we'll use a Python program to solve it.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of red tulips.\n2. Calculate the number of rows of red tulips Jackson can plant.\n3. Calculate the total number of blue tulips.\n4. Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant.\n5. Add these two row counts to find the total number of rows Jackson will plant.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, ceil\n\n# Given values\nred_tulips_per_row = 6\nblue_tulips_per_row = 8\nred_tulips_purchased = 3.6 * 10\nblue_tulips_purchased = 2.4 * 10\n\n# Calculate total number of red and blue tulips Jackson buys\ntotal_red_tulips = Rational(red_tulips_purchased)\ntotal_blue_tulips = Rational(blue_tulips_purchased)\n\n# Calculate number of rows for each color, rounding up since partial rows are still full\nrows_red = ceil(total_red_tulips / red_tulips_per_row)\nrows_blue = ceil(total_blue_tulips / blue_tulips_per_row)\n\n# Total rows\ntotal_rows = rows_red + rows_blue\n\n# Print the result in fractional form\nprint(f\"Total number of rows: {total_rows}\")\n```\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate the total number of rows Jackson will plant for his tulips, taking into account both the red and blue tulips. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this."
