You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26.

We will approach this with Case 1, as the problem can be solved directly with Python code.\n\nKey Idea: \nThe total cost is the sum of the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil minus the discount from the voucher.\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of the pots and garden soil\ncost_of_pots = 19\ncost_of_soil = 26\n\n# Define the discount\ndiscount = 7\n\n# Calculate the total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = cost_of_pots + cost_of_soil - discount\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_expenditure)\n```\n\nLet's execute the above code to find the total money expended."
