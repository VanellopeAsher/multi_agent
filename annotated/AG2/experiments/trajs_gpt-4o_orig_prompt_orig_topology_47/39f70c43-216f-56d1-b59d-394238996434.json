You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We can break down the costs as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the five hamburgers.\n2. Calculate the cost of the ten packs of potato fries.\n3. Determine the cost of five cans of fruit drinks.\n4. Sum these costs to get the total cost.\n5. Subtract the total cost from $50 to find the change.\n\nSince we are dealing with whole numbers and straightforward arithmetic, we can use Python to calculate these things directly.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs\nburger_cost = 4  # dollars per hamburger\nfries_cost = Rational(3, 10)  # dollars per pack\ndrink_cost = Rational(1, 1)  # assume $1 per can based on common pricing structure\n\n# Quantities\nnum_burgers = 5\nnum_fries = 10\nnum_drinks = 5\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = (burger_cost * num_burgers) + (fries_cost * num_fries) + (drink_cost * num_drinks)\n\n# Amount given\namount_given = 50\n\n# Change calculation\nchange = amount_given - total_cost\n\n# Output the change\nprint(change)\n```\n\nIn this code, we use `sympy`'s `Rational` to ensure that we stick to fractions and avoid decimals. The code will calculate the change Carly receives back."
