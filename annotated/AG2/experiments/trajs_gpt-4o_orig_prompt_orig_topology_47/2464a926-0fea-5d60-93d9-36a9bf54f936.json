You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJolene and her friends are celebrating the start of summer with a water balloon battle.

Thus, the total number of balloons prepared is:\n   \\[ 10 \\times 30 = 300 \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of balloons used:**  \n   They started with 300 balloons, and by the end, 12 balloons remained. Therefore, the number of balloons used is:\n   \\[ 300 - 12 = 288 \\]\n\nWe will use Python to perform this calculation and output the result using a `print` function. Here's the code implementation:\n\n```python\n# calculate the total number of balloons\ntotal_balloons = 10 * 30\n# calculate the number of balloons used\nballoons_used = total_balloons - 12\n# print the result\nprint(\"Balloons used in the water balloon fight:\", balloons_used)\n```\n\nThe number of balloons used in the water balloon fight is \\(\\boxed{288}\\)."
