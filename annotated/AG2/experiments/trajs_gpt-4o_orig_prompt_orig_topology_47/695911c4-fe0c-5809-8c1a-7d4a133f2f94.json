You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Pauline spent on all her museum visits over the years. Here's how we can break down the solution:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of visits for the first 10 years when the cost per visit is $10.\n2. Calculate the increased cost of one visit after 10 years, when the price has increased by 150%.\n3. Calculate the cost of visits for the next 3 years with the increased price.\n4. Sum the total costs from these periods to find the total amount spent.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure we keep fractions if needed:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial cost and number of visits\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10\nvisits_per_year = 3\n\n# Total years of visits\ntotal_years = 10 + 3  # 10 years at initial price, and 3 more years after price increase\n\n# 1. Calculate cost for the first 10 years\n# Pauline visits 3 times a year for 10 years\ntotal_cost_first_10_years = visits_per_year * 10 * initial_cost_per_visit\n\n# 2. Calculate new cost per visit after 10 years (increased by 150%)\nincrease_percentage = 150\nnew_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit + (initial_cost_per_visit * increase_percentage / 100)\n\n# 3. Calculate cost for the next 3 years at increased price\ntotal_cost_next_3_years = visits_per_year * 3 * new_cost_per_visit\n\n# 4. Sum the total costs\ntotal_spent = total_cost_first_10_years + total_cost_next_3_years\n\nprint(f\"Total spent: {total_spent}\")\n```\n\nNow let's analyze the math:\n- First 10 years: \\( 3 \\text{ visits/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} \\times \\$10 = \\$300 \\)\n- After 10 years, the cost per visit: \\( \\$10 + 150\\%\\text{ of } \\$10 = \\$10 + 1.5 \\times \\$10 = \\$25 \\)\n- Next 3 years: \\( 3 \\text{ visits/year} \\times 3 \\text{ years} \\times \\$25 = \\$225 \\)\n\nThus, the total Pauline spent is \\( \\$300 + \\$225 = \\$525 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total amount Pauline spent is \\(\\boxed{525}\\)."
