You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.

Define the age of Carver's son as a variable.\n2. Use the given information about Carver's age to create an equation.\n3. Solve the equation to find the son's age.\n\nWe can directly use Python's SymPy library to solve the equation symbolically.\n\nHere's the Python code to find the son's age:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the son's age as a symbol\nson_age = symbols('son_age')\n\n# Carver is 60 years old and this is 8 years less than twice his son's age\n# So, Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 8\ncarver_age = 60\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(carver_age, 2 * son_age - 8)\n\n# Solve the equation\nson_age_solution = solve(equation, son_age)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(son_age_solution[0])\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will solve for the age of the son and print it in a symbolic integer form. Once executed, the solution will be found in \\(\\boxed{34}\\) years."
