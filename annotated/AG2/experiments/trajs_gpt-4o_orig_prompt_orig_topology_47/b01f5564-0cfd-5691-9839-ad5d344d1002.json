You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of protein John gets from eating 300 grams of mushrooms each day and then calculate this for a week. \n\nGiven that 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein, we will scale this up to find out how many grams of protein are in 300 grams of mushrooms. After that, we'll multiply the daily protein amount by 7 to find the weekly protein amount.\n\nThis problem can be solved directly using a simple calculation in Python, as follows:\n\n```python\n# Given data\ngrams_of_mushrooms_per_cup = 150\nprotein_per_cup = 4  # in grams\n\n# John's daily mushroom consumption\ndaily_mushroom_consumption = 300  # in grams\n\n# Calculate the protein content for 300 grams\nprotein_per_300g = (protein_per_cup / grams_of_mushrooms_per_cup) * daily_mushroom_consumption\n\n# Calculate weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein_intake = protein_per_300g * 7\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\nRun this code to get the answer, and the result will be the amount of protein John consumes per week in grams."
