You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Monday, a water tank measured 17 feet deep.

We can handle this using basic arithmetic calculations, which can be done directly using Python.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Calculate the water level on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to Monday's level.\n2. Calculate Wednesday's water level, which is two-thirds of Tuesday's level.\n\nCase 1 applies here since this problem can be straightforwardly solved with Python code.\n\nLet's write the code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Monday's water level\nmonday_level = 17\n\n# Tuesday's water level (add 7 feet)\ntuesday_level = monday_level + 7\n\n# Wednesday's water level (two thirds of Tuesday's level)\nwednesday_level = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_level\n\n# Output the Wednesday's water level\nprint(wednesday_level)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we'll find the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday."
