You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party.

Therefore, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle with the given dimensions.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nTo calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational\n\n# Define the dimensions\nlength = Rational('20.5')\nwidth = Rational('15.5')\n\n# Calculate the perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the perimeter in fractions/radical form rather than decimal form. Please execute the code to find the answer."
