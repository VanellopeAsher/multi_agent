She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 to her sister, making a total of 4 boxes given away. Mrs. Harrington then kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges and sold the rest. Each box contains 20 oranges.\n\n### Solution Steps\n1. **Determine Initial Conditions:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of boxes initially.\n   - Therefore, total oranges = \\( 20x \\).\n\n2. **Oranges Given Away:**\n   - Oranges given away = \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Oranges After Giving Away:**\n   - Remaining oranges = \\( 20x - 80 \\).\n\n4. **Oranges Mrs. Harrington Kept:**\n   - She keeps 1/4 of the remaining oranges, hence kept oranges = \\( \\frac{1}{4}(20x - 80) \\).\n\n5. **Oranges Sold:**\n   - Sold oranges = Remaining oranges - kept oranges = \\( 20x - 80 - \\frac{1}{4}(20x - 80) \\).\n\nNow we will find the solution assuming a simple real-world scenario. We will assume Mrs. Harrington wants to sell all she doesn't keep or give away.\n\nLet's implement it in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define variable for the number of boxes\nx = symbols('x', positive=True, integer=True)\n\n# Oranges per box\noranges_per_box = 20\n\n# Total initial number of oranges\ntotal_oranges = x * oranges_per_box\n\n# Oranges given away (4 boxes)\ngiven_away_oranges = 4 * oranges_per_box\n\n# Remaining oranges after giving away\nremaining_oranges = total_oranges - given_away_oranges\n\n# Oranges kept by Mrs. Harrington (1/4 of what she has left)\nkept_oranges = remaining_oranges / 4\n\n# Oranges sold\nsold_oranges = remaining_oranges - kept_oranges\n\n# Let's compute this based on a feasible scenario:\nequation = solve(sold_oranges, x)\nx_value = equation[0]\n\n# Calculate number of oranges sold\ntotal_oranges_count = x_value * oranges_per_box\nsold_oranges_count = total_oranges_count - given_away_oranges - kept_oranges.subs(x, x_value)\n\nprint(f\"Total initial boxes: {x_value}\")\nprint(f\"Total oranges initially: {total_oranges_count}\")\nprint(\"Number of oranges sold:\", sold_oranges_count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nBy computing the number of initial boxes \\( x \\), we determine how much Mrs. Harrington sold after keeping her portion.
