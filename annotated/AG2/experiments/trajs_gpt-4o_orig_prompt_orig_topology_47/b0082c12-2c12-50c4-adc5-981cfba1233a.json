You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nLeah just got a new kitten.

This problem is straightforward and can be handled directly with Python code.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the vaccines after the discount.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the broken vases.\n3. Sum up the cost of spaying, the discounted vaccine costs, and the cost for the broken vases to get the total expense.\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\n# Cost of spaying\nspaying_cost = 200\n\n# Cost of each vaccine and the number of vaccines\nvaccine_cost_per_unit = 20\nnumber_of_vaccines = 3\ntotal_vaccine_cost = vaccine_cost_per_unit * number_of_vaccines\n\n# Applying the 10% discount on the total vaccine cost\ndiscount_rate = 0.10\ndiscounted_vaccine_cost = total_vaccine_cost * (1 - discount_rate)\n\n# Cost of each broken vase and the number of vases broken\nvase_cost_per_unit = 12\nnumber_of_vases_broken = 4\ntotal_vase_cost = vase_cost_per_unit * number_of_vases_broken\n\n# Total cost incurred\ntotal_cost = spaying_cost + discounted_vaccine_cost + total_vase_cost\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total amount that the kitten has cost so far.
