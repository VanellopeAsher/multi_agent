You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by two websites over the course of February, given their respective daily averages and the fact that February typically consists of either 28 or 29 days (in a leap year). Since the problem statement refers to \"2.8 times of ten days in the month,\" it suggests that we're dealing with a conventional 28-day February.\n\nLet's solve the problem using Python. Here's the plan:\n- Calculate the total articles for each website by multiplying their daily average by 28 days.\n- Sum these totals to get the combined total for both websites.\n\n```python\n# Using sympy to handle calculations with rational numbers\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the daily average articles for each website\npolitical_weather_daily = 20\nbusiness_daily = 10\n\n# Number of days in February\ndays_in_february = Rational(28)  # Using Rational to ensure no decimal approximation\n\n# Calculate total articles published by each company\npolitical_weather_total = political_weather_daily * days_in_february\nbusiness_total = business_daily * days_in_february\n\n# Calculate the combined total number of articles\ntotal_articles = political_weather_total + business_total\n\n# Output the total number of articles\nprint(total_articles)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `sympy` library to handle calculations exactly, without decimal approximation, by using rational numbers. The result will be displayed in its exact form or simplest rational form. Once we run this code, it will calculate the total number of articles published in February."
