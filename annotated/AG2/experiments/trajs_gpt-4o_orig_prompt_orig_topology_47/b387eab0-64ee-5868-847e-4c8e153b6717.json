You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Apply the cashback of $0.20 per gallon.\n3. Calculate the net price after cashback.\n4. Apply the 10% discount coupon on the net price to find the final price.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given values\nprice_per_gallon = 3.00\ncashback_per_gallon = 0.20\ndiscount_percentage = 0.10\ngallons_purchased = 10\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total initial cost\ninitial_total_cost = price_per_gallon * gallons_purchased\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total cashback\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons_purchased\n\n# Step 3: Calculate net cost after cashback\nnet_cost_after_cashback = initial_total_cost - total_cashback\n\n# Step 4: Calculate discount amount\ndiscount_amount = net_cost_after_cashback * discount_percentage\n\n# Step 5: Calculate final cost after discount\nfinal_cost = net_cost_after_cashback - discount_amount\n\n# Use Rational to express any decimal in fractional form\nprint(\"Initial total cost:\", Rational(initial_total_cost).limit_denominator())\nprint(\"Total cashback:\", Rational(total_cashback).limit_denominator())\nprint(\"Net cost after cashback:\", Rational(net_cost_after_cashback).limit_denominator())\nprint(\"Discount amount:\", Rational(discount_amount).limit_denominator())\nprint(\"Final cost:\", Rational(final_cost).limit_denominator())\n```\n\nThis code calculates each step and prints the result as a fraction to provide an exact representation.
