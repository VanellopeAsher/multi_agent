  "problem": "Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser.

We will follow Case 1 and write a Python program to handle the calculations. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define variables for the number of boxes sold on each day for both gingerbread and apple pie.\n2. Calculate the number of boxes sold and earnings for each day.\n3. Sum up the earnings over the three days to find the total amount earned.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations by writing the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the number of boxes sold on Saturday\ng_saturday = 10  # gingerbread boxes on Saturday\na_saturday = g_saturday - 4  # apple pie boxes on Saturday\n\n# Define the number of boxes sold on Sunday\ng_sunday = g_saturday + 5  # 5 more gingerbread boxes than on Saturday\na_sunday = 15  # 15 apple pie boxes on Sunday\n\n# Define the number of boxes sold on Monday\ng_monday = 2  # 2 gingerbread boxes on Monday\na_monday = 4  # 4 apple pie boxes on Monday\n\n# Define costs\ncost_gingerbread = 6\ncost_apple_pie = 15\n\n# Calculate earnings for each day\nearnings_saturday = (g_saturday * cost_gingerbread) + (a_saturday * cost_apple_pie)\nearnings_sunday = (g_sunday * cost_gingerbread) + (a_sunday * cost_apple_pie)\nearnings_monday = (g_monday * cost_gingerbread) + (a_monday * cost_apple_pie)\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = earnings_saturday + earnings_sunday + earnings_monday\n\n# Print the total earnings in a boxed format\nprint(f\"\\\\boxed{{{total_earnings}}}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the total earnings generated over the three days."
