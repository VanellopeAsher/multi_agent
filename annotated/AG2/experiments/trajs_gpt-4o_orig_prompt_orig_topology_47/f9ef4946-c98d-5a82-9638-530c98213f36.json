  "problem": "Frankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework. On Mondays and Tuesdays, he watches an hour-long episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he had to stay up late over the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes. How many hours did he watch TV in total?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Frankie watched TV over the course of the week, based on the given schedule. We can do this directly with Python code.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours.\n- Wednesday: Three 30-minute episodes is equivalent to \\(3 \\times 0.5 = 1.5\\) hours.\n- Thursday: One hour plus a 30-minute show is \\(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\\) hours.\n- Friday: Two one-hour episodes is \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours.\n\nNow, let's write a simple Python program to calculate the total hours:\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the total hours\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Time watched each day in hours\nmonday_hours = Rational(1, 1)\ntuesday_hours = Rational(1, 1)\nwednesday_hours = 3 * Rational(1, 2)\nthursday_hours = 1 + Rational(1, 2)\nfriday_hours = 2 * Rational(1, 1)\n\n# Total hours watched\ntotal_hours = monday_hours + tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours + friday_hours\n\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `Rational` function from the `sympy` package to ensure that we deal with fractions as required instead of decimals. Running this will give us the total hours watched in fractional form."
