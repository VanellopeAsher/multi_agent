You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours. He then works double that duration on Wednesday. On Thursday, he puts in 2 hours less than his Wednesday's work hours. What is the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days?"

      "content": "Key idea: The problem is straightforward and can be directly solved with basic arithmetic operations in Python. \n\nTo solve this, we need to find the number of hours worked by Bruce on each day and sum them up to get the total.\n\n1. Calculate the hours worked on Tuesday.\n2. Calculate the hours worked on Wednesday, which is double the amount worked on Tuesday.\n3. Calculate the hours worked on Thursday, which is 2 hours less than the hours worked on Wednesday.\n4. Add all the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to get the total hours.\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\n# Hours worked on Tuesday\ntuesday_hours = 5\n\n# Hours worked on Wednesday (double of Tuesday)\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\n\n# Hours worked on Thursday (2 hours less than Wednesday)\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# Total hours worked\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days."
