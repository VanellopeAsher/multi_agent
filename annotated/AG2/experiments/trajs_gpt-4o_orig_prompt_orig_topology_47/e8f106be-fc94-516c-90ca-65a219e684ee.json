His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is planning a birthday party and wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total length of the fence to which James will hang the crepe-paper streamers. The problem describes a rectangular fence with specific dimensions, and there is no indication that the tree affects the measurement of the fence perimeter. Therefore, we'll calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence and that will be the total length of the crepe paper needed.\n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Length of the fence: 20 feet\n- Width of the fence: 15 feet\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter of the fence.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to maintain exact arithmetic, though we won't need it here.\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Rational, simplify\n\n# Dimensions of the fence\nlength = 20\nwidth = 15\n\n# Calculate the perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the perimeter\nprint(\"The total length of crepe paper needed is {} feet.\".format(perimeter))\n```\n\nRunning this Python code will give the total length of crepe paper James needs to buy. Since the problem does not require the use of fractions or radicals, the output will be a straightforward calculation of the fence's perimeter. However, I will now calculate it:\n\nThe fence perimeter is:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{70}\n\\] \n\nJames needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper for the fence."
