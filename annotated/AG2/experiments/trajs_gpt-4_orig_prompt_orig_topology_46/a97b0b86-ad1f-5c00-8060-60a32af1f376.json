You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

      "content": "The key idea in solving this problem is to use basic algebra arithmetic. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and the apples. Then, we can subtract this from the total amount that Marie paid to find out how much she spent on pizza. Since we know the cost of each pizza box, we can then divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost of each pizza box to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. We'll solve this in Python directly.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define quantities\nchicken_meal_cost = 12\nmilk_cost_each = 3.5\nmilk_quantity = 5\napple_cost_each = 1.5\napple_quantity = 4\npizza_cost_each = 8.5\ntotal_amount_paid = 52.5\n\n# calculate total cost of milk and apples\ntotal_milk_cost = milk_cost_each * milk_quantity\ntotal_apple_cost = apple_cost_each * apple_quantity\n\n# calculate total cost of chicken meal, milk and apples\ntotal_cost_without_pizza = chicken_meal_cost + total_milk_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# find out the money spent on pizzas\npizza_money = total_amount_paid - total_cost_without_pizza\n\n# calculate how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered\npizza_boxes = pizza_money / pizza_cost_each\n\nprint(pizza_boxes)\n```\n\nThen we will run the code in the Python environment to get the result."
