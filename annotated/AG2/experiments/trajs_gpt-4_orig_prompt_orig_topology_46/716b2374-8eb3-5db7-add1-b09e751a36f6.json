  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

So every week he buys 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach. \n\nThe cost for the bleach for all homes every week would be 16 * 2 (because each bottle of bleach costs $2).\n\nThe total weekly costs include the costs for both bleach and cloth packs for 8 homes. We know the total income and profit of each week, so we can get the total expenses by subtracting profit from total income.\n\nFinally, dividing the total expense on cloths by the number of clients will give us the cost for each pack of cloths.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step."
