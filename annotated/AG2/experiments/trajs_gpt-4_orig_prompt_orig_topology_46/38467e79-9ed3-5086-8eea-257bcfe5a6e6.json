You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home.

The number of students who do not have a desktop computer equals the number that represents one-third of the total students.\n\nThen we can solve this problem by setting a simple equation and solve it.\n\nThe equation to solve this problem will be:\n\n1/3 * total_students = students_without_computers\n\nWe know that the number of students without computers is 30, so we can substitute that into our equation:\n\n1/3 * total_students = 30\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \"total_students\". Let's write a simple Python code to solve it. Let's use the sympy package which allows us to work with symbols and solve equations.\n\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\ntotal_students = symbols('x')\neq = 1/3 * total_students - 30\n\ntotal_students_number = solve(eq)\nprint(total_students_number[0])\n```"
