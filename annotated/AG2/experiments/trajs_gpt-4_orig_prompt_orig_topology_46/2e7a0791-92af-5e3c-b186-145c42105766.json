  "problem": "Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can calculate the total steps Elliot did before the jog, subtract this from his daily goal of 10,000 steps, then subtract the remaining 2,000 steps he had left to take after the jog.\n\nThe total steps Elliot took during the walks to and from school, the short walk with his friend, and shopping are half of 10,000 steps, 1,000 steps, and 500 steps respectively. We can simply add these up using addition in Python.\n\nThen we do the subtraction as described above to get the steps Elliot took during the jog. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the total steps\ntotal_steps = 10000\n\n# calculate steps of walks to school, short walk with friend and shopping\nto_from_school = total_steps / 2\nwalk_with_friend = 1000\nshopping = 500\n\nbefore_jog_steps = to_from_school + walk_with_friend + shopping\n\n# calculate steps took during the jog\njog_steps = total_steps - before_jog_steps - 2000\n\nprint(jog_steps)\n```\nThis should give us the number of steps Elliot took during his jog."
