You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $15.00 each and a ballpen at $5.00 each.

So, the total cost for the notebooks is $15.00 * 50.\n\nSimilarly, each ballpen costs $5.00, and William bought 10 ballpens. So, the total cost for the ballpens is $5.00 * 10.\n\nSumming up these costs should give the total amount William spent.\n\nI will now write a python code to perform these calculations. \n\n```python\n# define the cost of each notebook and ballpen\nnotebook_cost = 15.00 \nballpen_cost = 5.00 \n\n# define the number of notebooks and ballpens bought\nnotebooks_bought = 50 \nballpens_bought = 10 \n\n# calculate the total cost for notebooks and ballpens\ntotal_notebook_cost = notebook_cost * notebooks_bought\ntotal_ballpen_cost = ballpen_cost * ballpens_bought\n\n# calculate the total cost \ntotal_cost = total_notebook_cost + total_ballpen_cost\n\n# print the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```"
