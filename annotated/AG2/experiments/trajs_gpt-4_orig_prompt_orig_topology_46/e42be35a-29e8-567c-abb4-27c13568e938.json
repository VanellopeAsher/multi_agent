At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.

First, we calculate the total number of brownies that Greta had at the start of the day. For this, we add the ones she made (which is one dozen), the ones she got from her office party (which is half a dozen), and the ones her friends made for her surprise party (which is four dozen). \n\n1 dozen = 12 brownies\n1/2 dozen = 6 brownies\n4 dozen = 48 brownies\n\n2. Then, we calculate the number of brownies that were eaten during the party. This is one and a half dozen.\n\n1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies\n\n3. Finally, we subtract the number of brownies that were eaten from the total brownies to get the number of brownies left over. \n\nLet's write a Python program now to calculate the number of leftover brownies."
