  "problem": "Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. Manny also signed up for a painting class that costs $30, but his parents don't care about the cost of this class.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nManny's parents will not sign him up again if the cost per karate class exceeds $10. We can calculate the number of classes Manny can miss by dividing the total cost of the karate classes ($60) by $10, which is the cost limit per karate class set by his parents, subtract this number from the total number of karate classes (10), and then take the floor of the result since one cannot attend a fraction of a class.\n\nTherefore, using Python, we can create a function that performs those calculations.\n\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef missed_classes(total_cost, cost_limit, total_classes):\n    attended_classes = total_cost // cost_limit\n    missed_classes = total_classes - attended_classes\n    return missed_classes\n\n# Karate class information\ntotal_cost = 60\ncost_limit = 10\ntotal_classes = 10\n\n# Calculate how many classes Manny can miss\nmissed_classes = missed_classes(total_cost, cost_limit, total_classes)\n\nprint(missed_classes)\n```\n\nThe output will be the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again."
