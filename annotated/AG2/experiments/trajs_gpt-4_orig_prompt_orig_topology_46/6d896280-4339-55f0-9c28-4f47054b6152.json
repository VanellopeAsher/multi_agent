You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to set up an equation according to the given conditions in the problem: Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes the same amount of chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that amount on Friday.\n\nLet `x` be the amount of chimichangas made on Tuesday (which is the same on Wednesday). Then, Friday's chimichangas is `2x`. Therefore, we can form the following equation since the total chimichangas made across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is 500: \n\n`x (Tuesday) + x (Wednesday) + 2x (Friday) = 500`\n\nWe just need to solve this equation to find the value of `x`.\n\nLet's write the code for the solution:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(x + x + 2*x, 500)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"Chimichangas made on Tuesday: \", solution[0])\n```"
