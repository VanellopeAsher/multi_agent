  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend.
