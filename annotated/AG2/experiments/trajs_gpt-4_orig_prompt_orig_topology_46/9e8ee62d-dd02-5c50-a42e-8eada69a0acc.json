You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

      "content": "Key Idea: To solve this problem, we need to follow the growth pattern provided. First, we start with the beanstalk's original height. Then, we double this the second week. The third week's growth is the difference between the total height after three weeks and the height at the end of the second week. Thus, we need to calculate this difference.\n\nLet's write this in Python code.\n```python\n#Initial height after first week\ninitial_height = 3 \n\n#Height after second week\nsecond_week_height = initial_height * 2\n\n#Total height after third week\ntotal_height = 10\n\n#Growth in the third week\nthird_week_growth = total_height - second_week_height\n\nprint(third_week_growth)\n```"
