You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

Finally, we can divide the result by the size of a small t-shirt to get the number of small t-shirts used.\n\nFollowing the key idea, we can write a Python program to solve this problem as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# size of small, medium, and large t-shirts\nsmall_size, medium_size, large_size = 3, 4, 6\n\n# number of medium and large t-shirts\nmedium_num, large_num = 8, 6\n\n# total size of the quilt\nquilt_size = 101\n\n# Calculate the total square feet of medium and large t-shirts\nmedium_large_size = medium_size * medium_num + large_size * large_num\n\n# Calculate square feet of small t-shirts\nsmall_size_total = quilt_size - medium_large_size\n\n# Calculate number of small t-shirts\nsmall_num = small_size_total / small_size\n\nprint(small_num)\n```"
