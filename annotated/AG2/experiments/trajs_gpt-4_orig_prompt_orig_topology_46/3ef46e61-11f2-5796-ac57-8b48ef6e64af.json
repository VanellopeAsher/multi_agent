You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

Knowing how long it takes him to answer a call, we can calculate the total number of calls he can answer in a day. \n\nTo get the number of calls he deals with in a week, we need to multiply the number of calls per day with the number of regular days and then add the number of calls he answers on Friday, which also includes two additional hours for higher call volumes.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the variables\nhours_per_day = 6\nadditional_hours_friday = 2\nminutes_per_call = 15\ndays_per_week = 5\n\n# Calculate the total hours Tim works in a week\ntotal_hours_per_week = (days_per_week - 1) * hours_per_day + (hours_per_day + additional_hours_friday)\n\n# Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we calculate the total number of calls Tim can handle in a week\ntotal_calls = total_hours_per_week * (60 / minutes_per_call)\n\nprint(total_calls)\n```"
