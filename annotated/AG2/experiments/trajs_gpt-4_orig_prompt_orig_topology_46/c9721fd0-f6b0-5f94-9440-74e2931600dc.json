Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Patty charges a flat $40 service fee for each job.\n2. She also charges $35 for every hour or fraction of an hour of work. Hence, every fractional hour is rounded up to the next whole number of hours. In this job, she worked for 2.25 hours which rounds up to 3 hours.\n3. The cost of parts is also added to the bill.\n4.
