  "problem": "Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $2000, regardless of how many guests attend. While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is setting up an equation to represent the total cost for each venue and then solving that equation to find the number of guests.\n\nWe know the first venue charges a flat fee of $2000 plus $50 for each person who attends. This gives us the equation:\n\n2000 + 50g = cost for the first venue\n\nwhere g is the number of guests.\n\nThe second venue charges $250 for each person who attends. This gives us the equation:\n\n250g = cost for the second venue\n\nTo find the number of guests where the two venues would be equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for g, which gives us:\n\n2000 + 50g = 250g\n\nWe can simplify this equation to find the value for g.\n\nLet's solve this step by step following the process in Case 3: \n\nOur first step is to subtract 50g from both sides. The simplified equation will be 2000 = 200g. \n\nWe can then get the number of guests, g, by dividing both sides of the equation by 200: g = 2000 / 200. \n\nNow, let's do these calculations.\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variable g\ng = symbols('g')\n\n# set up the simplified equation\nequation = Eq(2000, 200 * g)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, g)[0]\n\nprint(solution)\n```"
