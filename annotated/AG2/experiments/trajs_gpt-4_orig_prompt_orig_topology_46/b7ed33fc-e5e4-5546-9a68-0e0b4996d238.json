You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.

As a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 30 minutes, an extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 3 * 30 minutes. We then divide this by the rate at which John drinks water, which is one bottle every 30 minutes.\n\nWe can directly solve this problem with python code. \n\n```python\n# time for normal sudoku in minutes\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30 \n\n# time it takes to do an extreme sudoku puzzle \nextreme_sudoku_time = normal_sudoku_time * 3 \n\n# bottles of water John drinks per hour\nbottles_per_hour = 2 \n\n# total bottles of water drunk during extreme sudoku\ntotal_bottles = extreme_sudoku_time / normal_sudoku_time * bottles_per_hour\n\nprint(total_bottles)\n```"
