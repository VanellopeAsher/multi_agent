You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries.

It is also given that Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard. We can form the equations and solve for the number of cherries that Richard and Jerry have. Finally, we can subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has to get the answer.\n\nLet's solve this with Python directly.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# define the symbols\nrichard_cherries, jerry_cherries = symbols('richard_cherries jerry_cherries')\n\n# given\ntotal_cherries = 6000\nrobert_cherries = 3000\n\n# form the equations\neq1 = richard_cherries + robert_cherries + jerry_cherries - total_cherries\neq2 = robert_cherries - richard_cherries - 1000\n\n# solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (richard_cherries, jerry_cherries))\n\n# calculate the result\nresult = robert_cherries - solution[jerry_cherries]\n\n# print the result\nprint(result)\n```\nAfter running the above program, the number in the output will be the answer."
