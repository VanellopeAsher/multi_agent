You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

We get the equation 4M + 4T + 4W = 104.\n\nWe can use sympy in Python to solve this equation system."

As the problem asks 'how many times as many articles did she write on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday?', we can then divide W by T to find out the answer.\n\nHere are the Python calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\nW = symbols('W')\nequation = Eq(20 + 28 + 4*W, 104)\nW_value = solve(equation, W)[0]\ntimes_on_Wednesday = W_value / 7\nprint(times_on_Wednesday)\n```\n\nThe result of print(times_on_Wednesday) is the answer."
