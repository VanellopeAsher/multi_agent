You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nColby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each.

After that, we simply divide the total amount of money (in pennies) by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.\n\n```python\n# Number of various coins Colby has\nquarters = 80 # 25 pennies each\ndimes = 60 # 10 pennies each\nnickels = 140 # 5 pennies each\npennies = 150\n\n# Convert all coins into pennies\ntotal_money_pennies = quarters * 25 + dimes * 10 + nickels * 5 + pennies\n\n# Cost of one gumball\ncost_of_gumball = 5 # 5 pennies each\n\n# Calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy\nnum_gumballs = total_money_pennies // cost_of_gumball\n\nprint(num_gumballs)\n```\nThe result will be the number of gumballs Colby can buy."
