However, before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\n48 people are riding a bus.

We need to subtract the number of passengers getting off from the total passenger count and add the number of passengers getting on to the total passenger count to get the total number of passengers after each stop. \n\nWe can write a Python program using these operations. \n\n```python\n# number of passengers riding the bus at the beginning\npassengers = 48 \n\n# number of passengers get off and get on on the first stop\noff_first_stop = 8\non_first_stop = off_first_stop * 5\n\n# the total number of passengers after the first stop\npassengers = passengers - off_first_stop + on_first_stop - 2\n\n# number of passengers get off and get on on the second stop\noff_second_stop = 21\non_second_stop = off_second_stop // 3\n\n# the total number of passengers after the second stop\npassengers = passengers - off_second_stop + on_second_stop\n\nprint(passengers)\n```\nThis code will print the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop."
