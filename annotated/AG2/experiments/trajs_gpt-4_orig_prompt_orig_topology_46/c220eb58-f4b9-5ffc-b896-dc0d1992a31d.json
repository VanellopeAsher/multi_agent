You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is simple arithmetic operation. The total number of messages delivered will be sum of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and messages delivered to Mr. Yu. However, we need to calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu, which is 1/3 of the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson.\n\nSo, we can write a Python script that performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Python script\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_thompson = 84\n\n# Number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu (1/3 of messages to Ms. Thompson)\nmessages_yu = Rational(1, 3) * messages_thompson\n\n# Total messages delivered\ntotal_messages = messages_thompson + messages_yu\n\nprint(total_messages)\n```\n\nThe above will calculate the total number of messages delivered."
