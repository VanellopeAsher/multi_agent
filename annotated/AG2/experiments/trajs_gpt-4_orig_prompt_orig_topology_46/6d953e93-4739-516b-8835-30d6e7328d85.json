For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

Then we can solve the equation for the unknown quantity which is the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n\nLet's denote the number of car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday as x. The money earned for each car tire repaired is $40.\n\nFrom the problem we know that:\n1. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires for a total charge of (60*6 + 40*4).\n2. On Friday, the mechanic repairs x car tires for a total charge of 40*x.\n3. The earnings of the mechanic on Thursday is $40 more than that of Friday. Thus we have the equaiton: (60*6 + 40*4) = 40*x + 40\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the value of x."
