Let me correct this. \n\nLet's say Joey scores 'x' points. So, Joey's new score would be: 214 + x. \n\nSince we don't know how many points Joey scored, we cannot compute the answer unless 'x' is given. In the previous calculation, 'x' is implicitly treated as zero. \n\nIf we still want to express the result in terms of 'x', the Python code would look like this: \n\n```python\n# your code\n\nJoey_score = 214 + x\nMarcy_score = 225 + 10  # Marcy gets 10 more points\n\nwinning_points = Joey_score - Marcy_score\nprint(winning_points)\n```\n\nThen, 'winning_points' would be the result on Joey's winning points."

In light of this error, 'x' should be assigned a value for the calculation to proceed as desired. However, as 'x' is an unknown quantity, we're unable to assign it an absolute numerical value. Therefore, the formula should be slighlty modified.\n\nWe should create a function to calculate the score difference. The function could look like this:\n\n```python\n# your code\n\ndef winning_points(x): \n    Joey_score = 214 + x\n    Marcy_score = 225 + 10  # Marcy gets 10 more points\n\n    winning_points = Joey_score - Marcy_score\n    return winning_points\n```\n\nNow you can call this function with any number of points Joey scored to determine by how many points he is now winning.
