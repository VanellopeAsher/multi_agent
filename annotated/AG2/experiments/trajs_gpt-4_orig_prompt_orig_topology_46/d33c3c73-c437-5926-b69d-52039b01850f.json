You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

We can solve this by tracking the water depth for each day using Python code.\n\nHere is how we can solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. Start with the known depth on Monday (17 feet).\n2. Calculate the depth on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to Monday's depth.\n3. Calculate the depth on Wednesday by multiplying Tuesday's depth by two thirds.\n4. Calculate the difference in depth between Tuesday and Wednesday.\n5. Calculate the amount the depth increases on Thursday by taking half of the difference calculated in step 4.\n6. Calculate the depth on Thursday by adding the amount it increases to the depth on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code for this process. We will use the sympy library to handle fractions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Known depth on Monday\nmonday_depth = 17 \n\n# Depth on Tuesday\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + 7 \n\n# Depth on Wednesday\nwednesday_depth = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_depth \n\n# Difference in depth between Tuesday and Wednesday\ndiff_depth = tuesday_depth - wednesday_depth \n\n# Increase in depth on Thursday\nthursday_increase = Rational(1, 2) * diff_depth \n\n# Depth on Thursday\nthursday_depth = wednesday_depth + thursday_increase \n\nprint(f'The water depth on Thursday is {thursday_depth} feet.')\n```"
