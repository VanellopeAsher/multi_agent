You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, so he will have 24/8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n\nHe can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row and he has 30 yellow tulips, so he will have 30/5 = 6 rows of yellow tulips. \n\nNext, we will add these up to get the total number of rows of flowers he will have.\n\nThat being said, let's perform these calculations in Python. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the number of tulips\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\nyellow_tulips = 30\n\n# define the number of tulips that can fit in a row\nred_in_row = 6\nblue_in_row = 8\nyellow_in_row = 5\n\n# calculate the number of rows for each color\nrows_red = red_tulips / red_in_row\nrows_blue = blue_tulips / blue_in_row\nrows_yellow = yellow_tulips / yellow_in_row\n\n# calculate the total number of rows\ntotal_rows = rows_red + rows_blue + rows_yellow\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nPlease run the Python code and let me know the result. Then we can check if it matches the requirement. \n\nBased on the condition \"he buys 30 yellow tulips\", the result should be an integer. The total number of rows = \\boxed{}."
