You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden.

This will give us the total number of rows Jackson will be planting.\n\nSo the number of rows of red tulips will be 36 divided by 6, and the number of rows of blue tulips will be 24 divided by 8. We then add these to give the total number of rows.\n\nLet me write the Python code for this. \n\n```python\n# number of red tulips\nred_tulips = 36\n# number of blue tulips\nblue_tulips = 24\n\n# tulips per row\nred_per_row = 6\nblue_per_row = 8\n\n# calculating number of rows\nred_rows = red_tulips / red_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips / blue_per_row\n\n# total number of rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```"
