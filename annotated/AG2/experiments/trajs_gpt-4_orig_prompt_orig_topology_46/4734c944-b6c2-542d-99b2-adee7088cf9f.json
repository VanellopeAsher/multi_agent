You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

Then, we find out how many action figures he bought from Sunday to Wednesday by dividing the total amount he spent in these days by the cost of a wooden action figure. Similarly, we find out how many action figures he bought from Thursday to Saturday by dividing the total amount he spent in these days by the cost of a plastic action figure. Finally, we add these two results to get the total number of action figures Peter bought in a week.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total amount of money Peter has\ntotal_money = 70\n\n# the cost of wooden and plastic action figures\ncost_wooden = 5\ncost_plastic = 2.5\n\n# number of days in a week\ndays_week = 7\n\n# number of days from Sunday through Wednesday and from Thursday to Saturday\ndays_wooden = 4\ndays_plastic = 3\n\n# calculate how much money Peter spends each day\nmoney_per_day = total_money / days_week\n\n# calculate the total number of wooden and plastic action figures Peter buys\nnum_wooden = days_wooden * money_per_day / cost_wooden\nnum_plastic = days_plastic * money_per_day / cost_plastic\n\n# calculate and print the total amount of action figures Peter buys\ntotal_action_figures = num_wooden + num_plastic\nprint(total_action_figures)\n```\nThe total number of action figures Peter buys in a week will then be calculated."
