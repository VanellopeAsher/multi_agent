You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

We need to sum all the money that everyone else donated and then multiply that amount by three to get the amount that Walter's lawyer is going to donate.\n\nLet's write out the steps in Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the amounts each group donated\nneighbors_donation = 300\nonline_donation = 1200\nfriend_donation = 120\n\n# Step 2: Sum the amounts donated by all the groups\ntotal_donation = neighbors_donation + online_donation + friend_donation\n\n# Step 3: Calculate how much Walters's lawyer is going to donate\nlawyer_donation = total_donation * 3\n\n# Step 4: Print the amount that Walters's lawyer is going to donate\nprint(lawyer_donation)\n```\n\nYou can run the above Python code to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute."
