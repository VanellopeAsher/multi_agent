You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag.

      "content": "The problem can be solved using arithmetic. \n\nLet's say the trader sold 'n' bags. For each bag, the cost of buying and transporting the bag is $(20 + 2) = $22. After selling each bag at a rate of $30, the profit for each bag is $(30 - 22) = $8. The total profit of $400 is hence the profit per bag multiplied by the number of bags. We can set up an equation and solve for 'n' as follows:\n```\n8n = 400\n```\nFrom the equation, we can find the number of bags sold."
