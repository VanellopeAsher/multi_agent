You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.

As a result, we can't determine the total cost for these ties from this information.\n\nCase 2: He spent $300 on yellow ties, with each yellow tie costing $30. We use this information to find out how many yellow ties he bought.\n\nCase 3: The price of each green tie is 70% more than that of a yellow tie. We use the cost of a yellow tie to find out the cost of a green tie.\n\nFrom these three cases, we can conclude that the problem did not provide enough information about the number of ties of each color that John bought, except for Yellow, so we can't determine how many red, blue and green ties he bought. Thus, we can't determine the total cost for all the ties. However, we can calculate how much he spent on yellow ties, and the price of each green tie. \n\nLet's do these calculations now."

We're told that the green ties cost 70% more than the yellow ties, which means the cost of a green tie is:\n\n```python\nincrease_percent = 70/100\ncost_per_green_tie = cost_per_yellow_tie + (cost_per_yellow_tie * increase_percent)\nprint(cost_per_green_tie)\n```\n\nRemember, this does not represent the total amount spent on ties, as we don't know how many green, blue, or red ties John bought.
