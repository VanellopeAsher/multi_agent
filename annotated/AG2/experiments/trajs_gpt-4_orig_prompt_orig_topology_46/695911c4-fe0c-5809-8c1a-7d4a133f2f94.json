In the first 10 years, the cost for every visit is $10 and Pauline visits the museum three times a year. In the following 3 years, the cost of a visit has gone up by 150%. So every visit costs $10 * (1 + 150/100) == $25. Again, she visits the museum three times a year. \n\nThe total amount spent is the sum of the cost for the first 10 years and the next 3 years. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Constants \ncost_per_visit1 = 10\nvisit_per_year = 3\nyear1 = 10\n\ncost_per_visit2 = cost_per_visit1 * (1 + 150/100)\nyear2 = 3\n\n# Cost for first 10 years\ncost1 = cost_per_visit1 * visit_per_year * year1\nprint(f\"The total cost for the first 10 years: ${cost1}\")\n\n# Cost for next 3 years\ncost2 = cost_per_visit2 * visit_per_year * year2\nprint(f\"The total cost for the next 3 years: ${cost2}\")\n\n# Total spending\ntotal_spending = cost1 + cost2\nprint(f\"The total spending for the 13 years: ${total_spending}\")\n```\n\n\\boxed{The total spending for the 13 years is $825}"

      "content": "It looks like there's a discrepancy in our calculations - let's double-check them.\n\nThe cost of each visit for the first 10 years is $10, and Pauline visits 3 times a year - that gives us: 10 * 3 * 10 = $300, which matches your result.\n\nHowever, in the next 3 years, the price for each visit increases by 150%, which makes it $10 * (1 + 150/100) = $25 per visit. Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year, making the total cost for these 3 years: 25 * 3 * 3 = $225.\n\nThus, Pauline's total spending for 13 years comes out to be $300 + $225 = $525.0.\n\nThe total $525.0 as you provided seems correct.\n\nThank you for pointing out the mistake.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{525}."
