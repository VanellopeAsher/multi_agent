You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts.

      "content": "The key idea is to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts. Given the problem, the first thing we need to do is to determine the total number of cuts. According to the problem, Marty initially cuts the ribbon into 40 equal parts, and then he divides each of the 40 parts into 50 equal parts. As a result, the total number of cuts is 40 * 50 = 2000. Hence, the length of each final cut is the total length of the ribbon divided by the total number of cuts. \n\nWe can solve this problem with Python code directly. Here it is:\n\n```python\ntotal_length = 10000  # total length of the ribbon in millimeters\ntotal_parts = 40 * 50  # total number of final cuts\n\n# calculating the length of each cut\nlength_each_cut = total_length / total_parts\nprint(length_each_cut)\n```\nThis code will print the length of each final cut."
