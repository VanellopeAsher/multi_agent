You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is realizing the implied ratios of unicorns' gender and location. The subpopulation of Scottish female unicorns can lead to the total population of unicorns in Scotland, which then can be extrapolated to the total global population.\n\nTo solve this problem, we start by finding the total number of unicorns in Scotland. Since the number of female unicorns in Scotland is 6 and these make up two-thirds of all Scottish unicorns, we can solve for the total number of Scottish unicorns via the following equation:\n\n`total_unicorns_scotland = num_female_unicorns_scotland * 3 / 2`\n\nNext, we know that the unicorns in Scotland comprise one third of the total number of unicorns in the world. Therefore we can solve for the total number of unicorns globally using the equation: \n\n`total_unicorns_global = total_unicorns_scotland * 3` \n\nLet's code these equations now:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# given information\nnum_female_unicorns_scotland = 6\n\n# calculate total number of unicorns in Scotland\ntotal_unicorns_scotland = num_female_unicorns_scotland * 3 / 2\n\n# calculate total number of unicorns in the world\ntotal_unicorns_global = total_unicorns_scotland * 3\n\n# print the results\nprint(total_unicorns_global)\n```"
