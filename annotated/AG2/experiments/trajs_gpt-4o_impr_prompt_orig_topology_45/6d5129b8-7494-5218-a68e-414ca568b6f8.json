Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16. What will be her age after 4 years?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine Charmaine's current age based on the information given and then calculate how old she will be in 4 years.\n\nHere's the approach:\n1. **Determine Charmaine's Current Age:**\n   - We know that in 12 years, Charmaine will be 16 years old.\n   - Thus, her current age can be calculated by subtracting 12 from 16.\n\n2. **Calculate Charmaine's Age After 4 Years:**\n   - Once we have her current age, we will add 4 years to it to determine her age in 4 years.\n\nLet's solve it step by step using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let x be Charmaine's current age.\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation based on the problem statement: In 12 years, Charmaine will be 16.\nequation = Eq(x + 12, 16)\n\n# Solve the equation for x.\ncurrent_age_solution = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Now, calculate her age after 4 years.\nage_after_4_years = current_age_solution + 4\n\n# Print the results using the required format.\nprint(f\"Current age of Charmaine: {current_age_solution}\")\nprint(f\"Charmaine's age after 4 years: {age_after_4_years}\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Equation Verification:**\n   - Starting equation: \\( x + 12 = 16 \\).\n   - Solving gives \\( x = 4 \\). So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.\n\n2. **Age After 4 Years:**\n   - Currently: 4 years old\n   - After 4 years: \\( 4 + 4 = 8 \\).\n\nAfter confirming each step is correct:\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
