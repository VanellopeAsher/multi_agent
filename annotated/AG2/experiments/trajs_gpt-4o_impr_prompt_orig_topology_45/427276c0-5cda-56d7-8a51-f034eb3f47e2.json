Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels.

Here's how we'll tackle it:\n\n### Key Idea:\nThe average heel height can be calculated by finding the total combined height of all the heels and dividing that by the number of women wearing the heels.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n1. Calculate the total height contributed by the women wearing 4.5-inch heels.\n2. Calculate the total height contributed by the women wearing 2.5-inch heels.\n3. Find the total combined height.\n4. Determine the average by dividing the total height by the total number of women.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the given format.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Constants for the problem\nheels_4_5_inches = 4.5\nheels_2_5_inches = 2.5\nnumber_of_4_5_inches = 3\nnumber_of_2_5_inches = 3\n\n# Calculate the total height for each type of heel\ntotal_height_4_5 = heels_4_5_inches * number_of_4_5_inches\ntotal_height_2_5 = heels_2_5_inches * number_of_2_5_inches\n\n# Calculate the total combined height\ntotal_combined_height = total_height_4_5 + total_height_2_5\n\n# Calculate the average height\ntotal_women = number_of_4_5_inches + number_of_2_5_inches\naverage_height = Rational(total_combined_height, total_women)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The average heel height at the party is {average_height} inches.\")\n```\n\n### Verification:\n1. Total height for 4.5-inch heels: \\( 4.5 \\times 3 = 13.5 \\) inches.\n2. Total height for 2.5-inch heels: \\( 2.5 \\times 3 = 7.5 \\) inches.\n3. Combined total height = \\( 13.5 + 7.5 = 21 \\) inches.\n4. Number of women = \\( 3 + 3 = 6 \\).\n5. Average heel height = \\( \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5 \\) inches.\n\nThe average heel height at the party is \\(\\boxed{3.5}\\) inches."
