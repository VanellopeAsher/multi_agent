Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the total cost Clara and Sheila paid for their apples on each respective day and find the difference between these total costs. We'll use a step-by-step approach. Let's begin:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost for Clara:**\n\n   Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each. Without discounts, the total cost is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total\\_cost\\_Clara} = 15 \\times 15\n   \\]\n\n   Clara received a $3 discount because of her voucher. Thus, the final cost for Clara is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final\\_cost\\_Clara} = \\text{Total\\_cost\\_Clara} - 3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost for Sheila:**\n\n   On the next day, the price of an apple increased to $25. Sheila buys 15 apples. The total cost before the discount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total\\_cost\\_Sheila} = 15 \\times 25\n   \\]\n\n   The store offers a 15% discount on the total cost. Thus, the discount amount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount\\_amount\\_Sheila} = 0.15 \\times \\text{Total\\_cost\\_Sheila}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final\\_cost\\_Sheila} = \\text{Total\\_cost\\_Sheila} - \\text{Discount\\_amount\\_Sheila}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the Difference in Final Costs:**\n\n   Finally, calculate the difference in the amounts paid by Clara and Sheila:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Final\\_cost\\_Sheila} - \\text{Final\\_cost\\_Clara}\n   \\]\n\nLet's do these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Clara's calculations\nprice_per_apple_clara = 15\nnumber_of_apples = 15\nvoucher_discount = 3\n\ntotal_cost_clara = price_per_apple_clara * number_of_apples\nfinal_cost_clara = total_cost_clara - voucher_discount\n\n# Sheila's calculations\nprice_per_apple_sheila = 25\ndiscount_rate = Rational(15, 100)\n\ntotal_cost_sheila = price_per_apple_sheila * number_of_apples\ndiscount_amount_sheila = discount_rate * total_cost_sheila\nfinal_cost_sheila = total_cost_sheila - discount_amount_sheila\n\n# Calculate difference\ndifference = final_cost_sheila - final_cost_clara\n\n# Output the difference\nprint(difference)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify each calculation:\n\n1. **Clara's Total Cost:**\n   - Total before discount: \\( 15 \\times 15 = 225 \\)\n   - Final cost after voucher: \\( 225 - 3 = 222 \\)\n\n2. **Sheila's Total Cost:**\n   - Total before discount: \\( 15 \\times 25 = 375 \\)\n   - Discount: \\( \\text{15\\% of 375} = 0.15 \\times 375 = 56.25 \\)\n   - Final cost after discount: \\( 375 - 56.25 = 318.75 \\)\n\n3. **Difference in Costs:**\n   - Difference: \\( 318.75 - 222 = 96.75 \\)\n\nThus, the final confirmed difference is \\( \\boxed{96.75} \\)."
