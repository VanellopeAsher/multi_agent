Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries. If Robert has 3000 cherries, and has 1000 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's start with the given details:\n\n1. Robert has 3000 cherries.\n2. Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard.\n\nWe need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. \n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Find the number of cherries Richard has**:\n   Since Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard, if Robert has 3000, then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cherries Richard has} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cherries that Richard and Robert have together**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cherries Richard and Robert have} = 3000 + 2000 = 5000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of cherries Jerry has**:\n   Since the total number of cherries is 6000, and we have already accounted for Robert and Richard, Jerry must have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cherries Jerry has} = 6000 - 5000 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry**:\n   Robert has 3000 cherries, and Jerry has 1000 cherries. Therefore, Robert has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000\n   \\]\n\nThus, Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry. \n\nLet's verify each step logically:\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n\n1. Robert having 1000 more cherries than Richard implies Richard has 2000 cherries if Robert has 3000.\n2. Total cherries shared between Richard and Robert equal 5000, confirming Jerry must indeed have 1000 cherries.\n3. Difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries is 2000.\n\nThese verifications confirm our deductions and calculations.\n\nTherefore, Robert has \b\\( \\boxed{2000} \\) more cherries than Jerry."
