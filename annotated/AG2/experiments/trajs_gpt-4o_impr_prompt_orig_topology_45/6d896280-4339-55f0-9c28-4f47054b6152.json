      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. If they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that amount on Friday, how many chimichangas do they make on Tuesday?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll use a combination of algebra and Python programming to determine the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n   - Since the shop makes the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, Wednesday must also be \\( x \\).\n   - On Friday, they make twice that amount, which is \\( 2x \\).\n\n2. **Formulate the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   x \\, (\\text{Tuesday}) + x \\, (\\text{Wednesday}) + 2x \\, (\\text{Friday}) = 500\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   4x = 500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 4 to find \\( x \\).\n\nLet's compute using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation from the problem\nequation = Eq(4 * x, 500)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\nTo verify the solution:\n1. Substitute \\( x = 125 \\) back into the equation:\n   - Tuesday, \\( x = 125 \\)\n   - Wednesday, \\( x = 125 \\)\n   - Friday, \\( 2x = 250 \\)\n2. Total = \\( 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\nSince our values match perfectly, the resolved answer is:\n\n\\( \\boxed{125} \\)"
