Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can proceed with a step-by-step approach. We need to account for the number of visits over a certain span of years and the associated costs that change over time.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Visits and Costs for the First 10 Years:**\n    - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.\n    - The cost per visit for the first 10 years is $10.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for the first 10 years} = 3 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\]\n\n2. **Determine the New Visit Cost After 10 Years:**\n    - After 10 years, the cost of a visit increases by 150%.\n    - Original cost per visit = $10.\n    - Increased visit cost = $10 + 150\\% \\times $10 = $10 + 1.5 \\times $10 = $25.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Visits and Costs for the Next 3 Years:**\n    - Pauline continues visiting the museum for 3 years.\n    - The new cost per visit is $25.\n  \n\\[ \\text{Total cost for the next 3 years} = 3 \\times 3 \\times 25 \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Overall Total Cost:**\n    - Combine the costs for the first 10 years and the next 3 years.\n  \nNow, let's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs and visit increase\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10\nincrease_percentage = 150\nyears_first_period = 10\nyears_second_period = 3\nvisits_per_year = 3\n\n# Total cost for the first 10 years\ntotal_cost_first_10_years = visits_per_year * years_first_period * initial_cost_per_visit\n\n# New cost per visit\nnew_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit * (1 + Rational(increase_percentage, 100))\n\n# Total cost for the next 3 years\ntotal_cost_next_3_years = visits_per_year * years_second_period * new_cost_per_visit\n\n# Total cost Pauline spent\ntotal_cost_pauline_spent = total_cost_first_10_years + total_cost_next_3_years\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost_pauline_spent)\n```\n\nLet's execute the plan and see the calculations:\n\n- For the first 10 years: \\(3 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 300\\).\n- For the next 3 years with the increased cost: \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 25 = 225\\).\n- The total amount spent by Pauline: \\(300 + 225 = 525\\).\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify:\n\n1. **Verify cost for first 10 years:**\n   \\(3 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 300\\). This matches our calculation.\n\n2. **Verify new cost per visit:**\n   \\(10 + 1.5 \\times 10 = 25\\).\n\n3. **Verify cost for subsequent 3 years with new cost per visit:**\n   \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 25 = 225\\).\n\n4. **Add both costs to find the total:**\n   \\(300 + 225 = 525\\).\n\nThe verification steps confirm our calculations are correct.\n\nThus, Pauline spent a total of \\(\\boxed{525}\\) dollars on all her museum visits over 13 years."
