Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJordan plays video games every day. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Jordan spends playing video games each day and then calculate how much he would earn if he used that time to work instead. The problem doesn't specify how many hours Jordan spends on video games each day, so we lack crucial data to provide an exact answer.\n\nLet's break down the steps needed to solve this problem:\n\n### Step-By-Step Process\n\n1. **Gather Necessary Information:**  \n   - Determine the number of hours Jordan spends playing video games each day.\n   - This information is missing from the problem statement.\n\n2. **Make Calculations If Data Were Available:**  \n   - If Jordan plays video games for \\( x \\) hours each day, then in a week (7 days), he would play for \\( 7x \\) hours.\n   - If he worked instead of playing video games, he would earn \\( 10 \\) dollars per hour.\n   - Therefore, he would earn \\( 10 \\times 7x = 70x \\) dollars in a week.\n\n### Handling Missing Data\n\nSince the problem does not provide the specific number of hours Jordan spends on video games each day, we cannot compute the exact amount of money he would earn in a week by replacing that time with work hours.\n\nThus, the solution to this problem, considering the missing data, is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None}} \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Ensure All Data Is Considered:**  \n   - The problem does not provide the number of hours played per day, confirmed by reviewing the statement.\n\n2. **Check Calculation Steps:**  \n   - Assuming we had \\( x \\) hours, the formula used ( \\( 70x \\) ) is verified as correct for calculating weekly earnings.\n\n3. **Confirm Outcome Based on Available Information:**  \n   - Lacking \\( x \\) hours makes any specific numerical answer impossible, consistent with the requirement to handle missing data appropriately. \n\nThe boxed answer reflects the inability to provide a numerical result due to missing critical information in the problem statement."
