Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows. She has 6 presents for her family members, 4 presents for her buddies, and 2 presents for her educators. She possesses 144 inches of ribbon for this task. What is the length in inches of ribbon that she can allocate for each present's bow?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon can be allocated to each present given the total amount of ribbon available and the number of presents.\n\n**Problem-Solving Approach:**\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of presents Monica has.\n\n- For her family: 6 presents\n- For her buddies: 4 presents\n- For her educators: 2 presents\n\n**Step 2:** Compute the total number of presents.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total presents} = 6 + 4 + 2 \\]\n\n**Step 3:** Divide the total ribbon length by the total number of presents to find the length of ribbon for each present.\n\n**Solution Using Python:**\n\nLet's implement this using Python and ensure the use of the `sympy` library for precision and clarity.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of presents\ntotal_presents = 6 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total length of ribbon available\ntotal_ribbon_length = 144\n\n# Calculate the ribbon length for each present, using Rational for fraction\nribbon_per_present = Rational(total_ribbon_length, total_presents)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(ribbon_per_present)\n```\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Presents:**  \n   \\( 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \\)\n\n2. **Divide Ribbon Length:**  \n   \\( \\frac{144}{12} = 12 \\)\n\nSo, the length of ribbon Monica can allocate for each present's bow is indeed \\(\\boxed{12}\\) inches."
