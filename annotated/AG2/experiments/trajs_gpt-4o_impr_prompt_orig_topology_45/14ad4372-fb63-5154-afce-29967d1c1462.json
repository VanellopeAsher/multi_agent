Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday.

      "content": "To solve the problem of calculating Judy's weekly earnings, we'll use the following approach:\n\n### Key Idea and Concept:\nJudy earns money through teaching dance classes each week. We need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches from Monday to Saturday, the number of students she teaches in each class, and her earnings per student. Sunday's schedule is not included as it is a rest day.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Classes per Week:**\n   - From Monday to Friday: Judy teaches 5 classes each day.\n   - On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.\n   \n2. **Compute Total Number of Classes:**\n   - Monday to Friday: \\(5 \\text{ classes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 25 \\text{ classes}\\)\n   - Saturday: 8 classes\n   - **Total classes per week:** \\(25 + 8 = 33\\) classes\n\n3. **Calculate Total Earnings:**\n   - She has 15 students per class.\n   - She charges $15 per student per class.\n   - **Earnings per class:** \\(15 \\text{ students} \\times \\$15/\\text{student} = \\$225\\)\n   - **Total Weekly Earnings:** \\(33 \\text{ classes} \\times \\$225/\\text{class}\\)\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Given values\nclasses_per_day_weekdays = 5\nclasses_on_saturday = 8\nstudents_per_class = 15\ncharge_per_student = 15\n\n# Calculate total classes in a week\ntotal_classes = (classes_per_day_weekdays * 5) + classes_on_saturday\n\n# Calculate earnings per class\nearnings_per_class = students_per_class * charge_per_student\n\n# Calculate total weekly earnings\ntotal_earnings = total_classes * earnings_per_class\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify each step:\n- **Number of Classes:**\n  - Monday to Friday: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n  - Saturday: 8\n  - Total: \\(25 + 8 = 33\\) classes\n  - Correct.\n\n- **Earnings Calculation:**\n  - **Earnings per class:** \\(15 \\text{ students} \\times \\$15 = \\$225\\)\n  - Total Earnings for 33 classes: \\(33 \\times \\$225 = \\$7425\\)\n  - Correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is verified, and Judy makes \\(\\boxed{7425}\\) dollars in one week."
