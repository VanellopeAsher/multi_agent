      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKatherine has 50 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece. How much will she spend filling all 50 hanging baskets?"

      "content": "To solve Katherine's problem, we need to calculate the total cost of filling all 50 hanging baskets with the specified number of petunias and sweet potato vines. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of Petunias**:\n   - Each basket contains 30 petunias.\n   - Petunias cost $3.00 each.\n   - Total number of petunias for 50 baskets: \\( 30 \\times 50 \\).\n   - Total cost for petunias: \\( 30 \\times 50 \\times 3.00 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost of Sweet Potato Vines**:\n   - Each basket contains 20 sweet potato vines.\n   - Sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each.\n   - Total number of sweet potato vines for 50 baskets: \\( 20 \\times 50 \\).\n   - Total cost for sweet potato vines: \\( 20 \\times 50 \\times 2.50 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost**:\n   - Add the total cost of petunias and the total cost of sweet potato vines.\n\nNow, let's compute these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Let's calculate the total cost\n\n# Number of baskets\nnum_baskets = 50\n\n# Petunias\npetunias_per_basket = 30\ncost_per_petunia = 3.00\ntotal_cost_petunias = num_baskets * petunias_per_basket * cost_per_petunia\n\n# Sweet potato vines\nvines_per_basket = 20\ncost_per_vine = 2.50\ntotal_cost_vines = num_baskets * vines_per_basket * cost_per_vine\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = total_cost_petunias + total_cost_vines\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's compute the above calculations using the steps described.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Cost of Petunias:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of petunias} = 30 \\times 50 = 1500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for petunias} = 1500 \\times 3.00 = 4500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of Sweet Potato Vines:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of vines} = 20 \\times 50 = 1000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for vines} = 1000 \\times 2.50 = 2500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Cost:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 4500 + 2500 = 7000\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations confirm the logic, and everything checks out. Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend is: \\( \\boxed{7000} \\)."
