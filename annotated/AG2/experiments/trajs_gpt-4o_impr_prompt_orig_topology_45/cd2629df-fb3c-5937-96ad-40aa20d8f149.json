      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first outline the steps needed to calculate how much Stephen will need to pay his sister in the twelfth month.\n\n### Key Problem-Solving Steps\n\n1. **Calculate Total Debt with Interest:**\n   - Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to pay back an additional 2%, which is the interest.\n\n2. **Calculate Monthly Payments:**\n   - Stephen pays $25 per month for 11 months.\n\n3. **Determine Remaining Balance:**\n   - After 11 months of payment, determine how much is left to pay back.\n\n4. **Calculate 12th Month Payment:**\n   - Compute the remaining balance Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month.\n\n### Let's code this approach in Python using the `sympy` library for any necessary symbolic calculations, though this case will likely just involve arithmetic.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate total debt with interest\ninitial_debt = 300\ninterest_rate = Rational(2, 100)  # 2% interest\ntotal_debt = initial_debt * (1 + interest_rate)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total payments over 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\ntotal_paid_in_11_months = monthly_payment * 11\n\n# Step 3: Calculate remaining balance after 11 months\nremaining_balance = total_debt - total_paid_in_11_months\n\n# Step 4: The 12th month payment is the remaining balance\nprint(\"Stephen will pay his sister the following amount in the twelfth month:\")\nprint(remaining_balance)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We calculate the total debt Stephen owes including the 2% interest.\n- We compute how much Stephen would have paid over 11 months.\n- We subtract what was paid from the total debt to find out how much he still owes by the twelfth month.\n- The result of the remaining balance is what Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his spending on coins.\n\n### Verification\n- **Calculate Interest:** \\(300 \\times 0.02 = 6\\). So, the total debt with interest is \\(300 + 6 = 306\\).\n- **Payments Before 12th Month:** \\(25 \\times 11 = 275\\).\n- **Remaining Balance** after 11 months: \\(306 - 275 = 31\\).\n\nThus, Stephen will need to pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
