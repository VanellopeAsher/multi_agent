Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another inches in the third week and the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inces tall. How many inches did the beanstalk grow in the third week?"

      "content": "To determine how much the beanstalk grew in the third week, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Height:** After the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.\n2. **Second-Week Growth:** The problem states it doubled in height during the second week. Therefore, by the end of the second week, the height of the beanstalk would be:\n   - \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches.\n3. **Third-Week Growth:** By the end of the third week, the total height is given as 10 inches. We need to find how much it grew during the third week.\n\nWe can find the third-week growth by subtracting the height at the end of the second week from the height at the end of the third week.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial height after the first week\ninitial_height_week1 = 3\n\n# Height after second week (doubled)\nheight_week2 = initial_height_week1 * 2\n\n# Given final height after the third week\nfinal_height_week3 = 10\n\n# Calculate the growth in the third week\ngrowth_week3 = final_height_week3 - height_week2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(growth_week3)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Start of Week 2:** 3 inches.\n2. **End of Week 2:** Should double to \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches.\n3. **End of Week 3:** Total height is 10 inches.\n4. **Increment in Week 3:** \\(10 - 6 = 4\\) inches.\n\nThe calculation confirms that this reasoning is correct.\n\nThe beanstalk grew \\( \\boxed{4} \\) inches in the third week."
