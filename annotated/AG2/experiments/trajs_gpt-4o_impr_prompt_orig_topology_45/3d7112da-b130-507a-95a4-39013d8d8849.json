Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a step-by-step process. Our goal is to find out how much time John spent sightseeing based on the activities he performed and the time distribution details provided.\n\n### Step-By-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Time for Specific Activities:**\n    - John spent 6.6 hours boating.\n    - He spent half of the time he spent boating on swimming. Thus, swimming time = \\( \\frac{6.6}{2} \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the Time Spent Watching Shows:**\n    - John watched 3 shows, each 2.5 hours long. Thus, total time spent on shows = \\( 3 \\times 2.5 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Use the Percentage Information to Establish Equations:**\n    - According to the problem, watching shows accounted for 30% of the total time he spent. Let's denote the total time spent as \\( T \\).\n    - Therefore, \\( 0.3T = \\text{time spent on shows} \\).\n    \n4. **Solve for \\( T \\) and Deduce the Sightseeing Time:**\n    - After calculating \\( T \\), we use the next percentage information: 40% of the total time \\( T \\) was used for sightseeing. \n    - \\( \\text{Sightseeing time} = 0.4T \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Activity Time:**\n    - Total time for boating, swimming, and shows gives us a linear equation to solve for \\( T \\).\n\nLet's implement these steps using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the total time\nT = symbols('T', positive=True)\n\n# Calculate specific activity times\nboating_time = 6.6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 3 * 2.5\n\n# Equation for the total time T\n# 30% of T is the time spent watching shows\nshow_time_equation = 0.3 * T - shows_time\n\n# Solve for T\ntotal_time = solve(show_time_equation, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate sightseeing time, which is 40% of T\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time\n\n# Display the result\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Activity Duration:**\n    - Boating: 6.6 hours\n    - Swimming: 3.3 hours (accurate since half of 6.6)\n    - Shows: 7.5 hours (3 shows, 2.5 hours each)\n\n2. **Equation Verification:**\n    - Show time accounts for 30% of total time, thus \\( T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} = 25 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Calculate Sightseeing Time:**\n    - Sightseeing time = 0.4 * 25 = 10 hours\n\nThe Python code will compute these accurately, yielding the result:\n\n\\(\\boxed{10}\\) \n\nThus, John spent 10 hours sightseeing."
