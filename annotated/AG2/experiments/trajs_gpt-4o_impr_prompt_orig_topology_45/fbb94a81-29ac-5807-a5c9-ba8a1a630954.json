Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 18 years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided in the problem statement.\n\nLet's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \\( P \\), \\( A \\), and \\( J \\), respectively.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following equations:\n\n1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100:\n   \\[\n   P + A + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul is 18 years older than Jean:\n   \\[\n   A = J + 18\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:\n   \\[\n   P = A + J\n   \\]\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using Python and the sympy library to find the values of \\( P \\), \\( A \\), and \\( J \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nP, A, J = symbols('P A J')\n\n# Equation 1: Combined age is 100\neq1 = Eq(P + A + J, 100)\n\n# Equation 2: Paul is 18 years older than Jean\neq2 = Eq(A, J + 18)\n\n# Equation 3: Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages\neq3 = Eq(P, A + J)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (P, A, J))\n\n# Extract Peter's age from the solution\npeter_age = solution[P]\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(peter_age)\n```\n\nLet's execute this plan and find out Peter's age. The values \\( P \\), \\( A \\), and \\( J \\) should satisfy all the given conditions, leading us to the correct solution.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Verify Equation 1: The combined age should sum to 100. \n2. Verify Equation 2: Ensure Paul is exactly 18 years older than Jean.\n3. Verify Equation 3: Check that Peter's age equals the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.\n\nIf all these verifications hold true for the solution we find, we can be confident of its correctness.\n\nFinally, we will box the answer for Peter's age as per the required format.\n\n```python\n# Execute the verification steps\n# Calculate the ages using the solution\np_age = solution[P]\na_age = solution[A]\nj_age = solution[J]\n\n# Verification\nassert p_age + a_age + j_age == 100, \"Sum of ages does not equal 100\"\nassert a_age == j_age + 18, \"Paul's age is not 18 years greater than Jean's\"\nassert p_age == a_age + j_age, \"Peter's age does not equal the sum of Paul's and Jean's\"\n\n# If verification passes without assertion, box the answer\nprint(f\"\\\\boxed{{{p_age}}}\")\n```\n\nBy running this code, we'll determine Peter's age and ensure its correctness through verification."
