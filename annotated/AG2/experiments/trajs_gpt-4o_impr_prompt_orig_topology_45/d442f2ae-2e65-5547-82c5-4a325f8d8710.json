Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn goes to the market with $10,000 in his pocket. He buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. He also considers buying a horse for $2000 but decides against it. How much money did he spend at the market?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total amount John spent at the market by summing up the costs of the items he purchased. Specifically, we'll determine the expenses for the goats and cows, while noting that he did not buy the horse. Let's solve this using a Python program.\n\nWe start by calculating the individual costs. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the cost for the goats: 3 goats, each costing $500.\n2. Calculate the cost for the cows: 2 cows, each costing $1500.\n3. Add these costs together to find the total expenditure.\n\nNow, let's implement this calculation in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the cost of goats\ncost_of_goats = 3 * 500\n\n# Calculate the cost of cows\ncost_of_cows = 2 * 1500\n\n# Calculate the total money spent by John\ntotal_spent = cost_of_goats + cost_of_cows\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the steps and ensure the calculation is correct:\n\n1. **Cost of Goats**: \n   - 3 goats × $500/goat = $1500\n\n2. **Cost of Cows**: \n   - 2 cows × $1500/cow = $3000\n\n3. **Total Spent**:\n   - $1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500\n\nOur calculations are consistent with the problem's requirements. John spent a total of $4500 at the market.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{4500}\\)."
