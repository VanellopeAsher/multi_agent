Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we will use a mathematical approach leveraging the given conditions to set up equations and solve for the son's age. Let's follow the structured approach to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the age of Carver's daughter.\n   - Let \\( s \\) be the age of Carver's son.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - We know Carver's age: \\( 45 \\) years.\n   - According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years younger than twice his daughter's age:\n     \\[\n     45 = 2d - 5\n     \\]\n   - The daughter's age is 4 years older than three times the son's age:\n     \\[\n     d = 3s + 4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equations:**\n   - First, solve for \\( d \\) using the first equation:\n     \\[\n     45 = 2d - 5 \\implies 2d = 50 \\implies d = 25\n     \\]\n   - Now use the value of \\( d \\) in the second equation to solve for \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     25 = 3s + 4 \\implies 3s = 21 \\implies s = 7\n     \\]\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Check Carver's Age Equation:**\n   - From \\( 45 = 2d - 5 \\), substituting \\( d = 25 \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 25 - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that our solution for \\( d \\) is correct.\n\n2. **Check Daughter's and Son's Age Relationship:**\n   - From \\( d = 3s + 4 \\), substituting \\( s = 7 \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 7 + 4 = 21 + 4 = 25\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that our solution for \\( s \\) is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter confirmation, the son is found to be \\( \\boxed{7} \\) years old."
