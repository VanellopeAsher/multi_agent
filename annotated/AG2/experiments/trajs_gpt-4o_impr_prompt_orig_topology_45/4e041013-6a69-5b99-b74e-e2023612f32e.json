      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden. He can accommodate 6 red tulips per row and 8 blue tulips per row. If Jackson purchases 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of tulips will he end up planting?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow the Direct Python Solution method since it involves straightforward division to determine how many rows of each type of tulip Jackson can plant.\n\n### Key Idea\n\nJackson needs to plant 36 red tulips with 6 per row and 24 blue tulips with 8 per row. To find out how many rows he will plant for each, we perform simple division.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Number of Rows needed for Red Tulips:**  \n   Divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in one row.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Rows needed for Blue Tulips:**  \n   Similarly, divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in one row.\n\nThe calculations should result in whole numbers since both 36 is divisible by 6 and 24 is divisible by 8.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the required format:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary library (not required for this computation but used for consistency)\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate rows for red tulips\nred_tulip_rows = 36 / 6\n\n# Calculate rows for blue tulips\nblue_tulip_rows = 24 / 8\n\n# Print the results using fractions\nprint(f\"Number of rows for red tulips: {Rational(red_tulip_rows)}\")\nprint(f\"Number of rows for blue tulips: {Rational(blue_tulip_rows)}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Red Tulips Verification:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36 \\text{ tulips}}{6 \\text{ tulips per row}} = 6 \\text{ rows}\n   \\]\n   This is exactly divisible and yields 6.\n\n2. **Blue Tulips Verification:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24 \\text{ tulips}}{8 \\text{ tulips per row}} = 3 \\text{ rows}\n   \\]\n   This is again exactly divisible and yields 3.\n\n### Final Result\n\nJackson will plant:\n- 6 rows of red tulips\n- 3 rows of blue tulips\n\n\\(\\boxed{6}\\) rows of red tulips and \\(\\boxed{3}\\) rows of blue tulips."
