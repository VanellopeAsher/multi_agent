Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRaymond initially had $2100. Then he saved $1100 from his allowance and spent $500 on a comic book and $1900 on a puzzle. How much money does Raymond have left?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how much money Raymond has left, we can use a straightforward arithmetic approach.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach\n\n**Case 1: Direct Python Solution**\n\nWe will calculate the total amount of money Raymond had initially, add his savings to it, and then subtract the expenses from this total. Let's write a Python script to compute the final amount using simple arithmetic operations.\n\n```python\n# Initial amount Raymond had\ninitial_amount = 2100\n\n# Amount saved from allowance\nsaved_amount = 1100\n\n# Expenses\nexpense_comic_book = 500\nexpense_puzzle = 1900\n\n# Calculate total amount after savings\ntotal_after_saving = initial_amount + saved_amount\n\n# Calculate the remaining amount after expenses\nremaining_amount = total_after_saving - expense_comic_book - expense_puzzle\n\n# Print the remaining amount\nprint(remaining_amount)  # Output the result\n```\n\nThis script will correctly calculate the remaining amount of money Raymond has after saving and spending.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: $2100\n2. **Savings**: $1100\n3. **Total Money**: \\( 2100 + 1100 = 3200 \\)\n4. **Total Expenses**: $500 (comic book) + $1900 (puzzle) = $2400\n5. **Remaining Amount**: \\( 3200 - 2400 = 800 \\)\n\n### Verification\n\nTo ensure this solution is correct, we verify:\n\n- **Initial Total with Savings**: \\( 2100 + 1100 = 3200 \\) dollars\n- **Total Expenses**: \\( 500 + 1900 = 2400 \\) dollars\n- **Final Checking**: \\( 3200 - 2400 = 800 \\) dollars\n\nAll calculations have been checked, and they are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the verified and final amount of money Raymond has left is \\(\\boxed{800}\\)."
