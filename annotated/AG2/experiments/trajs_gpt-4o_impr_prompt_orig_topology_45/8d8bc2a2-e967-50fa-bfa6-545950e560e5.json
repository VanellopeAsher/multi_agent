Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGeorge needs to pay for dental work.

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we'll first calculate the total cost of the dental work, and then determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the cost. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Cost of Dental Work\n1. **Cost of Each Implant:** $2000.5\n2. **George Needs 2 Implants:** So, total base cost for two implants = \\(2 \\times 2000.5\\).\n3. **Additional Cost for Porcelain Crown:** $500.5 for one implant.\n4. **Total Cost Calculation:** Add the base cost for two implants and the porcelain crown cost.\n\n### Step 2: Subtract the Deposit\n1. **Total Deposit:** $600, already paid.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Cost After Deposit\n1. **Remaining Cost to Be Paid:** Subtract the deposit from the total cost.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Working Hours\n1. **Hourly Wage:** $15.3.\n2. **Calculate Hours Required:** Divide the remaining cost by the hourly wage to find out how many hours George needs to work.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to determine the exact values:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary libraries\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the dental work\ncost_per_implant = Rational(20005, 10)  # $2000.5\nnum_implants = 2\ntotal_base_cost = cost_per_implant * num_implants\n\ncost_for_crown = Rational(5005, 10)  # $500.5\n\ntotal_cost = total_base_cost + cost_for_crown\n\n# Subtract the deposit\ndeposit = Rational(6000, 10)  # $600\nremaining_cost = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Calculate the number of hours needed\nhourly_wage = Rational(153, 10)  # $15.3\nrequired_hours = remaining_cost / hourly_wage\n\n# Print the number of hours in fractional form\nprint(required_hours)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find the solution!"
