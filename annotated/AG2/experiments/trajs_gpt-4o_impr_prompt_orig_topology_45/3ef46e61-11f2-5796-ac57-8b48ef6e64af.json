Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. However, on Fridays, he spends an additional 2 hours at work due to high call volumes. How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, considering his regular work hours and the additional time on Fridays. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate Daily Calls (Monday-Thursday):**\n   - Tim works for 6 hours each day.\n   - Each call takes 15 minutes.\n   - We convert the work hours to minutes: \\(6 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n   - Number of calls per day: \\(\\frac{360 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \\text{ calls}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Calls on Friday:**\n   - On Friday, Tim works 8 hours due to 2 extra hours.\n   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \\(8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n   - Number of calls on Friday: \\(\\frac{480 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ minutes/call}} = 32 \\text{ calls}\\).\n\n3. **Total Weekly Calls:**\n   - From Monday to Thursday, he handles 24 calls each day.\n   - Total calls from Monday to Thursday: \\(4 \\text{ days} \\times 24 \\text{ calls/day} = 96 \\text{ calls}\\).\n   - Add calls from Friday: \\(96 \\text{ calls} + 32 \\text{ calls} = 128 \\text{ calls}\\).\n\nNow, let me implement this in Python to verify the calculations.\n\n```python\n# Code to calculate the total number of calls Tim handles in a week\n\n# Define the number of minutes a day and time per call\nminutes_per_day = 6 * 60\nminutes_per_call = 15\n\n# Calculate daily calls from Monday to Thursday\ncalls_per_regular_day = minutes_per_day // minutes_per_call\n\n# Calculate extra hours on Friday\nfriday_minutes = (6 + 2) * 60  # 6 regular + 2 extra hours\n\n# Calculate calls on Friday\ncalls_on_friday = friday_minutes // minutes_per_call\n\n# Total week calls calculation\ntotal_weekly_calls = (4 * calls_per_regular_day) + calls_on_friday\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_weekly_calls)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. Verify daily calculations:\n   - Monday to Thursday: \\(24\\) calls per day is correct.\n   \n2. Verify Friday calculations:\n   - Total of \\(32\\) calls is accurate.\n\n3. Verify total week calculations:\n   - \\(4 \\times 24 + 32 = 128\\).\n\nEverything checks out; therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{128} \\]"

On Fridays, he works 2 additional hours due to high call volumes.\n\n1. **Daily Calls Monday to Thursday:**\n   - Total minutes in a 6-hour workday: \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) minutes.\n   - Number of calls he can handle: \\(\\frac{360}{15} = 24\\) calls.\n\n2. **Calls on Friday:**\n   - Total minutes for an 8-hour workday: \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) minutes.\n   - Number of calls he can handle: \\(\\frac{480}{15} = 32\\) calls.\n\n3. **Total Weekly Calls:**\n   - From Monday to Thursday (4 days), he handles: \\(4 \\times 24 = 96\\) calls.\n   - Add Fridayâ€™s calls: \\(96 + 32 = 128\\) calls.\n\nThus, the total number of calls he deals with during the week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{128}\n\\]\n\nEverything is consistent, and there don't appear to be any errors in the calculations.
