Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

We need to find the increase in water volume on the third day.\n\n1. **Initial Flow:** The flow of the river is initially 4000 gallons on the first day.\n2. **Second Day Flow:** After a day of heavy rain, the flow doubles on the second day.\n3. **Third Day Flow:** By the third day, the total flow is 14,000 gallons.\n\nTo find the increase in flow on the third day, we need to consider the cumulative flow from the previous days and compare it to the third day's total flow.\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the flow on the second day.**\n   - Initially, the flow is 4000 gallons.\n   - On the second day, the flow doubles: \\( 2 \\times 4000 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the total flow over the first two days.**\n\n3. **Given**: The total flow at the end of the third day is 14,000 gallons.\n\n4. **Calculate the increase in flow on the third day.**\n   - Subtract the total cumulative flow of the first two days from the third day's total flow, which is 14,000 gallons.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1\ninitial_flow = 4000  # gallons on the first day\n\n# Step 2\nsecond_day_flow = 2 * initial_flow\n\n# Step 3\ntotal_first_two_days = initial_flow + second_day_flow\n\n# Step 4\n# Let the increase on the third day be x gallons\nx = symbols('x')\nthird_day_total = 14000\n\n# Equation: total amount of water by end of the third day\neq = Eq(total_first_two_days + x, third_day_total)\n\n# Solve for x\nincrease_day_three = solve(eq, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"The increase in the amount of water on the third day is\", increase_day_three, \"gallons.\")\n```\n\n## VERIFICATION\n\n- **First Day Flow:** 4000 gallons\n- **Second Day Flow:** Doubled to \\( 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\) gallons\n- **Total Before Third Day:** \\( 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \\) gallons\n- **Total on Third Day:** 14,000 gallons\n- **Increase on Third Day:** \\( 14000 - 12000 = 2000 \\) gallons\n\nThe calculation holds, confirming that the increase in water flow on the third day is 2000 gallons.\n\nThus, the increase in the amount of water on the third day is \\(\\boxed{2000}\\) gallons."
