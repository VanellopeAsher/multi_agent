Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow a step-by-step process using Case 3: Step-by-Step Process. We will break down the problem and then use Python to calculate the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   Let \\( x \\) be the total number of daily flights made by the first aircraft.\n\n2. **Identify Key Information:**\n   - The second aircraft flies to Poland, making 44 flights, which is half of the total flights of the first aircraft. Thus, \\( x/2 = 44 \\).\n   - The first aircraft flies three-fourths of its flights to Greece. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \\((3/4) \\times x\\).\n   - The remaining flights are divided evenly between France and Germany.\n\n3. **Set up an Equation:**\n   Solve for \\( x \\) using the second aircraft's flight information.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Flights:**\n   Use the equation to find \\( x \\).\n   \n5. **Determine Flights to France:**\n   Calculate the number of flights each to France and Germany based on the leftover flights from those going to Greece.\n\n6. **Final Calculation Using Python:**\n\nHere's the Python code to conduct these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Step 2: Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(x / 2, 44)\n\n# Step 3: Solve for x\ntotal_flights = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Step 4: Calculate flights to Greece\nflights_to_Greece = (3/4) * total_flights\n\n# Step 5: Calculate remaining flights for France and Germany\nremaining_flights = total_flights - flights_to_Greece\n\n# Step 6: Since remaining flights are evenly divided\nflights_to_France = remaining_flights / 2\n\n# Step 7: Output the result\nprint(f\"The number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is {flights_to_France}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify Calculation Logic:**\n   - Given the second aircraft's flights, \\( x/2 = 44 \\) implies \\( x = 88 \\).\n   - The flights to Greece, \\((3/4) \\times 88 = 66\\).\n   - Remaining flights, \\( 88 - 66 = 22 \\).\n   - Each to France and Germany is \\( 22/2 = 11 \\).\n\n2. **Check all Calculations:**\n   - The total flights by the first aircraft: 88.\n   - Flights to Greece: 66.\n   - Flights to France: 11.\n   - Flights to Germany: 11.\n   - Total: 66 + 11 + 11 = 88, which matches the initial total.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."
