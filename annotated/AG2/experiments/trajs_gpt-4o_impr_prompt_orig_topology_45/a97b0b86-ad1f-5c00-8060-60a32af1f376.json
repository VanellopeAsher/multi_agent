Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $52.5. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a step-by-step approach to set up an equation that represents the total cost of Marie's order. We can then solve this equation using Python to find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered.\n\n### Step-By-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify Known Costs:**\n   - Chicken meal cost: $12\n   - Milk packs cost: $3.50 each, and she bought 5 packs.\n   - Apple cost: $1.50 each, and she bought 4 apples.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost (excluding pizza):**\n   - Total cost of chicken: $12\n   - Total cost of milk packs: \\(5 \\times 3.5 = 17.5\\)\n   - Total cost of apples: \\(4 \\times 1.5 = 6\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Order:**\n   - Total paid: $52.5\n\n4. **Let \\( x \\) be the number of boxes of pizza.** \n   - Each pizza costs $8.50.\n   - Establish an equation for the total cost:\n     \\[\n     12 + 17.5 + 6 + 8.5x = 52.5\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\) (number of pizza boxes):**\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\) using Python with the `sympy` package.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for the total cost\nequation = Eq(12 + 17.5 + 6 + 8.5 * x, 52.5)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nnumber_of_pizza_boxes = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(number_of_pizza_boxes)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute and verify the solution. \n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Summing non-pizza costs:**\n   \\[\n   12 + 17.5 + 6 = 35.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Remaining amount for pizza:**\n   \\[\n   52.5 - 35.5 = 17\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving for boxes of pizza:**\n   - Solve \\( 8.5x = 17 \\)\n   - Solving gives \\( x = 2 \\)\n\nThe calculation confirms that Marie ordered \\(\\boxed{2}\\) boxes of pizza."
