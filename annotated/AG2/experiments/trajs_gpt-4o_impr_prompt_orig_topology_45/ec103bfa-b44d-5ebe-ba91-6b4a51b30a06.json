Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $900. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $57?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered given the total cost she paid is $900. We know the costs for other items, so we can calculate the cost of the pizzas by subtracting these from the total amount. Finally, we'll divide the remainder by the cost per box of pizza to find out the number of boxes.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.\n\n2. Subtract the cost of these items from the total amount Marie paid ($900) to find the cost of the pizzas.\n\n3. Divide the remaining amount by the cost per box of pizza to find out how many boxes were ordered.\n\nLet's break down the solution using Python and ensure the calculations are accurate.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\npizza_cost_per_box = 57\n\n# Calculate the total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples\nchicken_meal_cost = 120\nmilk_cost_per_pack = 30\nmilk_packs = 5\napples_cost_per_apple = 1.5\napples_count = 40\n\ntotal_chicken_meal_cost = chicken_meal_cost\ntotal_milk_cost = milk_cost_per_pack * milk_packs\ntotal_apples_cost = apples_cost_per_apple * apples_count\n\n# Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples\ntotal_known_cost = total_chicken_meal_cost + total_milk_cost + total_apples_cost\n\n# Total amount Marie paid\ntotal_paid = 900\n\n# Calculate the remaining amount for pizzas\nremaining_amount_for_pizza = total_paid - total_known_cost\n\n# Define the number of pizza boxes variable\nnumber_of_pizza_boxes = symbols('number_of_pizza_boxes')\n\n# Equation to solve\nequation = Eq(number_of_pizza_boxes * pizza_cost_per_box, remaining_amount_for_pizza)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, number_of_pizza_boxes)\n\n# Print the number of pizza boxes\nprint(f\"The number of pizza boxes Marie ordered is: {solution[0]}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n- Verify each cost calculation:\n  - Chicken meal: $120\n  - Milk: 5 * $30 = $150\n  - Apples: 40 * $1.50 = $60\n\n  Total cost of known items: $120 + $150 + $60 = $330\n\n- Marie paid $900, so the remaining for pizza is $900 - $330 = $570.\n\n- Each pizza box costs $57. Therefore, the number of boxes is $570 / $57 = 10.\n\nAfter thoroughly verifying each step, the number of pizza boxes is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."

      "content": "It looks like we've already calculated the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered accurately. \n\nTo ensure clarity, the Python code computed the number of pizza boxes as 10. This aligns with our manual calculations:\n\n1. Total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples: \n   - Chicken meal: $120\n   - Milk: 5 packs * $30 = $150\n   - Apples: 40 * $1.50 = $60\n   - Total known cost = $120 + $150 + $60 = $330\n\n2. Total cost paid by Marie was $900. Subtracting the known costs:\n   - $900 - $330 = $570 remaining for pizzas.\n\n3. Each box of pizza costs $57:\n   - $570 / $57 = 10 boxes.\n\nThus, the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered is indeed \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."
