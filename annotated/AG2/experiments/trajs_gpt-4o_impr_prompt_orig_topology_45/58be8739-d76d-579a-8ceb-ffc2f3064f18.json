Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "Let's solve the problem using the given information.\n\n**Key Idea**: To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time John spent on his activities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate Total Time for Each Activity**:\n   - **Boating**: John's time spent boating is given as 6 hours.\n   - **Swimming**: John spent half the time of boating swimming, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours.\n   - **Watching Shows**: John watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours watching shows.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Time Spent on Activities**:\n   John notes that the time spent watching shows was 30% of the total time spent on all activities.\n\n3. **Equation Setup**:\n   Let \\( T \\) be the total time John spent on all activities. According to the problem, 30% of \\( T \\) is the time spent watching shows.\n\n   \\[ 0.3 \\times T = 6 \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( T \\)**:\n   To find \\( T \\), solve the equation:\n\n   \\[ T = \\frac{6}{0.3} \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Time Spent on Other Activities**:\n   Once we have \\( T \\), subtract the time spent on boating, swimming, and shows from \\( T \\) to find the time spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's compute this using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the total time as a symbol\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Equation based on the 30% time spent watching shows\nequation = 0.3 * T - 6\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Time spent on other activities\nboating_time = 6\nswimming_time = 3\nshows_time = 6\n\n# Calculate time spent sightseeing\nsightseeing_time = total_time - (boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time)\n\n# Print the result in a readable form\nprint(\"Time spent sightseeing:\", sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Verify each calculation:\n   - Swimming time is correct: \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours.\n   - Total shows time is correct: \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours.\n   \n2. Verify the equation and solution:\n   - Given: \\( 0.3 \\times T = 6 \\).\n   - Solving \\( T = \\frac{6}{0.3} = 20 \\), matches the total time.\n\n3. Check final calculation:\n   \\[ \\text{Sightseeing time} = 20 - (6 + 3 + 6) = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the time spent sightseeing is 5 hours.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
