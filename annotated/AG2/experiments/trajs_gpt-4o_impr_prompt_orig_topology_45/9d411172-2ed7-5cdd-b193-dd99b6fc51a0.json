Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $20 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 12 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $20. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Concept:**\nThe core idea here is to find out how many classes Manny can attend so that the cost per attended class remains $20 or less.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n1. Manny's total cost for the karate classes is $80.\n2. We want the cost per attended class to be less than or equal to $20.\n3. If `x` is the number of classes he attends, the cost per class Manny pays is given by the formula: \\( \\frac{80}{x} \\).\n\nThe inequality we need to solve is:\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20\n\\]\n\nWe'll solve for `x`.\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable x\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Solve the inequality 80/x <= 20\ninequality = 80 / x <= 20\nsolution = solve(inequality)\n\n# Since the solution gives us an interval or condition, \n# let's print it to understand how many classes he must attend at a minimum.\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nLet's calculate and interpret this solution.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. Solve the inequality \\( \\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20 \\).\n   - Multiply both sides by `x` (assuming `x` is positive to avoid changing the inequality direction):\n     \\[ 80 \\leq 20x \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 20:\n     \\[ 4 \\leq x \\]\n\n   This means Manny must attend at least 4 classes.\n\n2. If he attends 4 classes, the cost per class is exactly 20, which is acceptable.\n3. Therefore, he can afford to miss up to \\( 12 - 4 = 8 \\) classes.\n\nManny can miss a maximum of 8 classes.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"

      "content": "The solution expression `(4 <= x) | (x < 0)` uses logical operators to form a compound logical expression.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. **Sub-inequality \\(4 \\leq x\\):** \n   - This inequality means that `x` can be any value greater than or equal to 4.\n\n2. **Sub-inequality \\(x < 0\\):** \n   - This inequality means that `x` can also be any value less than 0.\n\n3. **Logical OR (\\(|\\)):**\n   - The vertical bar `|` is a bitwise OR operator in Python; however, in the context of logical expressions, it represents a logical OR condition: \\(4 \\leq x\\) OR \\(x < 0\\).\n\nIn terms of the solution to the inequality for \\(x\\):\n- The solution \\(4 \\leq x\\) indicates that Manny should attend at least 4 classes, which we concluded is correct because that ensures the per-class cost does not exceed $20.\n- The \\(x < 0\\) part isn't applicable to the problem context regarding real-world logic, since `x` represents the number of classes attended and cannot be a negative number.\n  \nThus, the relevant solution to indicate sufficient attendance for Manny in the context is only:\n- \\(4 \\leq x\\), meaning he attends at least 4 classes.\n\nSo Manny can miss a maximum of \\(12 - 4 = 8\\) classes:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
