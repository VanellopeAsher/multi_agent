      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

      "content": "To determine the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the three components of the bill: the service fee, the labor charges, and the cost of parts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Service Fee**: A flat $40 fee is charged for every house call, regardless of the time spent on the job.\n\n2. **Labor Fee**: The labor fee is $35 per hour or fraction of an hour. For a job lasting 2.25 hours, Patty's Plumbing will charge for 3 full hours, because they charge for each fraction of an hour as a complete hour. Thus, the labor cost is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Labor Fee} = 3 \\times 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Parts**: The parts used cost $60, which is charged directly as part of the bill.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total bill using these components.\n\n```python\n# Calculating the total bill for the plumbing job\n\n# Initial fixed service fee\nservice_fee = 40\n\n# Calculating labor fees - rounding up to nearest hour \nhours_worked = 2.25\n# Labor is charged per full hour (or fraction thereof)\nlabor_fee_per_hour = 35\nlabor_fee = ((hours_worked // 1) + bool(hours_worked % 1)) * labor_fee_per_hour\n\n# Cost of parts\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# Total bill\ntotal_cost = service_fee + labor_fee + parts_cost\n\n# Printing the total billing cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Service Fee**: $40 which is flat and does not depend on the job details.\n\n2. **Labor Charges**: Since 2.25 hours is more than 2 but less than 3, Patty's Plumbing charges for 3 full hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Labor Charge} = 3 \\times 35 = 105\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Parts**: $60 as given.\n\nAdding all these:\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Cost} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205 \n\\]\n\nThe verified total amount billed for Patty's Plumbing service is \\(\\boxed{205}\\)."
