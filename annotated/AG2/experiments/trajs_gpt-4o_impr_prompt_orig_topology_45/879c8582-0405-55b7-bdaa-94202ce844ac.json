Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sports cards Miss Maria is distributing to her students and how many students are each receiving ten cards. We'll start by calculating the total number of cards in each category and then find out how many cards are given to the students after she keeps some.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Cards\n\n- **Basketball Cards:** Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each. \n- **Baseball Cards:** She has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each. \n- **Soccer Cards:** She has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.\n\nTotal cards can thus be calculated as follows:\n\n- Total basketball cards = \\(6 \\times 25\\)\n- Total baseball cards = \\(5 \\times 40\\)\n- Total soccer cards = 30\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total and Remaining Cards\n\n- **Total Cards:** Add up all the cards from each category.\n- **Cards Kept by Miss Maria:** Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.\n- **Cards Given to Students:** Subtract the 50 cards she keeps from the total to determine how many cards are given to the students.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Number of Students\n\nEach student receives 10 cards. Divide the total number of cards distributed to students by 10 to find the number of students.\n\nLet's do the calculations using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Calculate total cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\nsoccer_cards = 30\n\n# Total cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards + soccer_cards\n\n# Cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Each student receives 10 cards\nstudents = cards_given_to_students // 10\n\n# Print result\nprint(students)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Basketball Cards:** \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n2. **Baseball Cards:** \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\).\n3. **Soccer Cards:** 30.\n4. **Total Cards:** \\(150 + 200 + 30 = 380\\).\n5. **Cards Given to Students:** \\(380 - 50 = 330\\).\n6. **Number of Students:** \\(330 \\div 10 = 33\\).\n\nAfter checking each step, the calculations confirm the solution is accurate. Hence, the number of students is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]"
