Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. During his recovery, he managed to regain 5 pounds per month for 2 months. If his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight before he fell ill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll track Mark's weight changes over time to determine his original weight before he fell ill.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Weight Loss Calculation:**\n   - Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.\n   - Total weight lost during the illness period = \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\) pounds.\n\n2. **Weight Gain Calculation:**\n   - During recovery, Mark regained 5 pounds per month for 2 months.\n   - Total weight regained during the recovery period = \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) pounds.\n\n3. **Final Weight:**\n   - Mark's final weight after recovery is 70 pounds.\n\n**Calculating Initial Weight:**\n\nTo find the initial weight before the weight changes, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial weight} - \\text{Total weight lost} + \\text{Total weight regained} = \\text{Final weight}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( W \\) be Mark's initial weight. Then:\n\n\\[\nW - 30 + 10 = 70\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( W \\):\n\n\\[\nW - 30 + 10 = 70 \\implies W - 20 = 70 \\implies W = 70 + 20 \\implies W = 90 \n\\]\n\nThus, Mark's initial weight was 90 pounds.\n\nLet's confirm our calculations:\n\n- Initial weight = 90 pounds.\n- After 3 months of illness, weight = \\(90 - 30 = 60\\) pounds.\n- After 2 months of recovery, weight = \\(60 + 10 = 70\\) pounds.\n\nThis matches the provided final weight, indicating that our calculations are correct.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Weight loss during illness: 3 months × 10 pounds = 30 pounds.\n2. Weight after illness = Initial weight - 30 pounds = \\(W - 30\\).\n3. Weight gain during recovery: 2 months × 5 pounds = 10 pounds.\n4. Weight after recovery = Weight after illness + 10 pounds = Final weight = 70 pounds.\n5. Rearranging the final equation: Initial weight = 70 + 20 = 90 pounds.\n\nOur solution has been verified to be consistent by explaining each step and checking the calculations. Hence, we present the final verified solution:\n\n\\(\\boxed{90}\\)"
