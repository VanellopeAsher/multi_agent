Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends. How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will track the number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has initially, account for the cards she passes out, and add the ones she receives. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n1. **Initial Cards:**\n   - Erica made 20 Valentine's cards herself.\n   - Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. However, the number of cards in each box is not specified. Usually, the problem would provide this detail; since it's missing, we'll denote the number of cards in each box as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Cards Passed Out:**\n   - Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.\n   - She also passed out 5 cards to her family.\n   - Total cards passed out = 24 + 5 = 29 cards.\n\n3. **Cards Received:**\n   - Erica received 17 cards from family and friends.\n\n4. **Calculation of Remaining Cards:**\n   - Erica's current cards = Initial Cards + Received Cards - Passed Out Cards.\n   - Assuming each box has \\( x \\) cards, Erica's final count of cards would be:\n   \\[\n   (20 + 2x) - 29 + 17 = 8 + 2x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification Steps:**\n   - Check if the total number of cards involves any missing data regarding the number of cards in each pre-made box.\n   - Since we don't know the number of cards per box, our result depends on \\( x \\), which makes it unsolvable without this key information.\n\nSince the number of cards per box is unspecified, rendering the problem unsolvable with the provided data, we use:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\]\n\nfor any numerical conclusion this problem could have."
