Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $3000/month, her credit card's minimum is $2000/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $5000/month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jessica pays on her debts each month and then compute the total annual payment.\n\nKey Idea:\n- Jessica's total minimum monthly payment is the sum of payments for student loans, credit card, and mortgage.\n- She intends to pay 50% more than the minimum monthly payment.\n- We must multiply this increased monthly payment by 12 to get the total annual payment.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate Jessica's minimum monthly payment:\n   - Student loans: $3000\n   - Credit card: $2000\n   - Mortgage: $5000\n\n2. Compute the total minimum monthly payment by summing these values.\n\n3. Calculate the payment Jessica makes each month by increasing the total monthly payment by 50%.\n\n4. Finally, multiply this value by 12 to get the total annual payment.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# code\n# Importing necessary package for dealing with fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational, simplify\n\n# Minimum payments for each debt type\nstudent_loans_payment = 3000\ncredit_card_payment = 2000\nmortgage_payment = 5000\n\n# Calculate the total minimum monthly payment\ntotal_minimum_monthly_payment = student_loans_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate the increased monthly payment with a 50% increase\nincreased_payment = total_minimum_monthly_payment * (1 + Rational(1, 2))\n\n# Calculate the total annual payment\ntotal_annual_payment = increased_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result using fractions\nprint(\"Total annual payment:\", simplify(total_annual_payment))\n```\n\nRunning the above code will provide the total amount Jessica needs to pay in a year, adhering to the constraints given (using fractions and printing the result). Let me compute the result for you.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Total minimum monthly payment = 3000 + 2000 + 5000 = 10000\n2. Increased monthly payment = 10000 * 1.5 = 15000\n3. Total annual payment = 15000 * 12 = 180000\n\nThe calculations are correct. Therefore, the total amount Jessica needs to pay annually is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{180000}\\]"
