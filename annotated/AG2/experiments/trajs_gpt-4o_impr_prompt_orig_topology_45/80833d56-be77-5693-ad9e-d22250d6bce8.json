Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 100 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine John's running speed, given the total distance he runs in a week and the distribution of his running across the three days.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nWe need to calculate John's total running time over the week and then find his average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Running Time:**\n   - John runs 10 hours on the first day.\n   - On the other two days, he runs half as much each day. So, for each of these days, he runs \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Sum Up the Total Running Time:**\n   - Total time = \\( 10 \\) (first day) + \\( 5 \\) (second day) + \\( 5 \\) (third day) = \\( 20 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Find the Average Speed:**\n   - Total distance run in a week = \\( 100 \\) miles.\n   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = \\( \\frac{100}{20} \\) miles per hour.\n\nLet's implement this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total distance \ntotal_distance = 100  # in miles\n\n# Time spent running\nfirst_day_time = 10  # in hours\nsecond_and_third_day_time = first_day_time / 2\n\n# Total running time in hours\ntotal_time = first_day_time + 2 * second_and_third_day_time\n\n# Average speed calculation\naverage_speed = Rational(total_distance, total_time)  # in miles per hour\n\n# Display the result\nprint(f\"Average Speed: {average_speed} miles per hour\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the average speed in fractional form.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Check Total Running Hours:**\n   - First day: 10 hours.\n   - Other two days: 5 hours each.\n   - Total time should sum up to 20 hours: \\( 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 \\).\n\n2. **Verify Calculation of Average Speed:**\n   - Speed = \\( \\frac{100}{20} = 5 \\) miles per hour.\n\nThe calculations are verified and consistent.\n\nThus, the average speed of John is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\] miles per hour."
