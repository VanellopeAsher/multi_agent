Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 12 weeks, we can break down the problem into a series of logical steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs Consumed Daily:**\n   - Claire eats 3 eggs every day.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs Consumed Weekly:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week. So, Claire consumes:\n     \\[\n     3 \\, \\text{eggs/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days/week} = 21 \\, \\text{eggs/week}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs Consumed in 12 Weeks:**\n   - Multiply the number of weeks by the number of eggs consumed per week:\n     \\[\n     21 \\, \\text{eggs/week} \\times 12 \\, \\text{weeks} = 252 \\, \\text{eggs}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert the Total Number of Eggs into Dozens:**\n   - A dozen equals 12 eggs. So, divide the total number of eggs by 12 to convert to dozens:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{252 \\, \\text{eggs}}{12 \\, \\text{eggs/dozen}} = 21 \\, \\text{dozens}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm our calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of eggs Claire eats per day\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# Number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Number of weeks\nweeks = 12\n\n# Calculate eggs per week\neggs_per_week = eggs_per_day * days_in_week\n\n# Total eggs in 12 weeks\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_week * weeks\n\n# Convert eggs to dozens\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / 12\n\n# Output result\nprint(Rational(dozens_of_eggs))\n```\n\nLet's go through the code:\n\n- We first calculate the eggs consumed per week and then for 12 weeks.\n- Finally, to get the answer in dozens, we divide the total eggs by 12 and then use the `Rational` function to keep the result in a proper fraction if needed, although we expect an integer here.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n- We've calculated the eggs consumed per week correctly as 21.\n- Multiplying by 12 weeks gives us 252 eggs in total.\n- Dividing this by 12 gives exactly 21 dozens, confirming our computations.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{21}\\)."
