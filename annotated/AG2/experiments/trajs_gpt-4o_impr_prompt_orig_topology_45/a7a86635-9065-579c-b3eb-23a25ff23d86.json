Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down using a structured approach. We'll then use Python to calculate the specifics.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - There are 200 kids divided into two equal groups: girls and boys.\n   - Each group has 100 kids (since 200 divided by 2 is 100).\n   - Boys collectively brought back 600 seashells each. For 100 boys, this means they brought back a total of 600 * 100 seashells.\n   - The girls brought back seashells equal to the number brought by the boys plus four times what the boys brought.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Seashells Brought by Boys:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total seashells by boys} = 100 \\times 600 = 60000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Seashells Brought by Girls:**\n   - The girls brought back \n     \\[\n     60000 + 4 \\times 60000 = 60000 + 240000 = 300000\n     \\]\n   - Each girl brought back:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Shells per girl} = \\frac{300000}{100}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's use Python to compute the above calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total kids\ntotal_kids = 200\n\n# Equal groups\nnum_girls = total_kids // 2\nnum_boys = total_kids // 2\n\n# Seashells each boy brought back\nseashells_per_boy = 600\n\n# Total seashells brought back by boys\ntotal_seashells_boys = num_boys * seashells_per_boy\n\n# Total seashells brought back by girls calculation\ntotal_seashells_girls = total_seashells_boys + 4 * total_seashells_boys\n\n# Seashells each girl brought back\nseashells_per_girl = Rational(total_seashells_girls, num_girls)\n\n# Output the result in fractional form if necessary\nprint(f\"Each girl brought back {seashells_per_girl} seashells.\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. The boys bring back a total of \\( 600 \\times 100 = 60000 \\) seashells.\n2. The girls bring back \\( 60000 \\) (what boys brought) plus four times that, \\( 240000 \\), totaling \\( 300000 \\) seashells.\n3. Dividing \\( 300000 \\) seashells by 100 girls gives us \\( 3000 \\) seashells per girl.\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\( \\boxed{3000} \\)."
