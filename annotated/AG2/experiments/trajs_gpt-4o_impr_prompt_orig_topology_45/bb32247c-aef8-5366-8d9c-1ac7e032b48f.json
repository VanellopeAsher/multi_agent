Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was several inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk at the end of the third week, given its growth pattern each week. Let's break down the growth process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Height After the First Week:**\n   - Let's assume the beanstalk was \\( h \\) inches tall at the end of the first week.\n\n2. **Second Week Growth:**\n   - During the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height. So, the height at the end of the second week will be \\( 2h \\).\n\n3. **Third Week Growth:**\n   - During the third week, the beanstalk grew an additional 4 inches. Hence, the height at the end of the third week will be \\( 2h + 4 \\) inches.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the initial height \\( h \\) after the first week, which implies it considers an abstract or variable-specific solution. Our representation will be a formula that gives the final height after three weeks based on any initial height \\( h \\).\n\nLet's express and print the final height using Python with symbolic representation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week\nh = symbols('h')\n\n# Calculate the height at the end of the third week\nheight_after_3_weeks = simplify(2 * h + 4)\n\n# Output the final height expression\nprint(height_after_3_weeks)\n```\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to specify a particular initial height \\( h \\) to get a numerical answer, or if the formulaic result is sufficient for understanding the beanstalk's growth over these weeks."

Let's go through the solution and verify:\n\n1. **Initial Height After the First Week:** We defined the height after the first week as \\( h \\) inches.\n\n2. **Second Week Growth:** The height after the second week is doubled, resulting in \\( 2h \\).\n\n3. **Third Week Growth:** After growing an additional 4 inches in the third week, the total height becomes \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nThe symbolic representation \\( 2h + 4 \\) correctly models the growth process over the three weeks.\n\nLet's verify the calculation in the VERIFICATION section:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- Start: \\( h \\) (end of first week)\n- After week two: \\( 2 \\times h = 2h \\)\n- After week three: \\( 2h + 4 \\)\n\nThis confirms our calculations are correct. Thus, the height of the beanstalk after three weeks, in terms of the initial height \\( h \\), is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2h + 4} \\]\n\nIf you have a specific value for \\( h \\), you can substitute it into the formula to determine the precise height after three weeks."
