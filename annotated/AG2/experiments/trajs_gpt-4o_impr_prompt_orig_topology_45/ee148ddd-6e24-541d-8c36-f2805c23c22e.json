Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Total Activity Time**:  \n   John's activities include boating, swimming, and watching shows. The time spent on breaks and lunch is not included in these activities.\n\n2. **Calculate Time for Boating and Swimming**:\n   - Boating: 6 hours\n   - Swimming: Half of boating time = \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours\n\n3. **Calculate Time for Watching Shows**:\n   - 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours: \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\n4. **Calculate Total Activity Time**:\n   - Total activity time = Boating + Swimming + Watching Shows \n   - \\(6 + 3 + 6 = 15\\) hours\n\n5. **Determine Percentage of Total Activity Time**:\n   - Watching shows represents 30% of the activity time. Therefore, let's set the total time spent on activities as \\( T \\).\n   - According to the problem, 30% of \\( T \\) is 6 hours: \n     \\[\n     0.30 \\times T = 6 \\implies T = \\frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing**:\n   - Sightseeing accounts for 40% of the total time.\n   - Therefore, time spent sightseeing = \\( 0.40 \\times T = 0.40 \\times 20 = 8 \\) hours\n\nNow, let's verify the steps to ensure correctness.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Compute Total Activity Based on Watching Shows**:\n   - Watching shows = 30% of total activity time\n   - \\( 6 \\) hours was 30% of the total, hence \\( T = 6 / 0.30 = 20 \\) correct calculation.\n\n2. **Calculate Sightseeing Time by Percentage**:\n   - 40% of 20 hours = \\( 8 \\) hours, correct.\n\nHaving verified each calculation, the amount of time John spent sightseeing is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"
