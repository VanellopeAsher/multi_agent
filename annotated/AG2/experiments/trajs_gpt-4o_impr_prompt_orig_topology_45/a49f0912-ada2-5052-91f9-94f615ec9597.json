Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing based on the information given. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n1. **Calculate John's Total Time Spent:**\n   - John spent 60 hours boating.\n   - He spent half of 60 hours swimming, which is \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) hours.\n   - He watched 30 shows, each 20 hours long, so he spent \\( 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\) hours watching shows.\n  \n2. **Determine the Total Time from Percentage Information:**\n   - The time John spent watching shows (600 hours) is 30% of his total time.\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the total time John spent on all activities. We have:\n     \\[\n     0.3T = 600 \\implies T = \\frac{600}{0.3}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Time:**\n   - Solving \\( T = \\frac{600}{0.3} \\) gives us \\( T = 2000 \\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing accounts for 40% of the total time.\n   - Time spent sightseeing = \\( 0.4 \\times 2000 \\)\n\n### Python Code to Perform Calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, solve, symbols\n\n# Define the total time variable\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Given that 600 hours is 30% of total time (T)\nequation = Rational(30, 100) * T - 600\n\n# Solve for T\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Time spent sightseeing is 40% of total time\nsightseeing_time = Rational(40, 100) * total_time\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. We solved \\( 0.3T = 600 \\) to find \\( T = 2000 \\).\n2. Checking: 0.3 of 2000 is 600, matching the time spent watching shows.\n3. Calculating 40% of 2000, which is the confirmed total time, gives us the sightseeing hours.\n\nFinally, print the result:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{800}\n\\]\n\nThus, John spent 800 hours sightseeing."
