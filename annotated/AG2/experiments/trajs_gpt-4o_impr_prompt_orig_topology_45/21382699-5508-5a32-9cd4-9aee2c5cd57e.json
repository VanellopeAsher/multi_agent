Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now."

We need to find Allen's age 10 years from now.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Define Age Variables:**\n   - Let Darrell's current age be \\(7x\\).\n   - Let Allen's current age be \\(11x\\).\n   \n   Since their ages sum up to 162, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   7x + 11x = 162\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - Simplify and solve the equation to find \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Calculate Allen's Age:**\n   - Allen's current age is \\(11x\\).\n   - Add 10 years to find Allen's age 10 years from now.\n\nNow, let's use Python to perform these calculations using the sympy library.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the age ratios\nequation = 7*x + 11*x - 162\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Darrell's and Allen's current ages\ndarrell_age = 7 * solution[0]\nallen_age = 11 * solution[0]\n\n# Allen's age 10 years from now\nallen_age_10_years = allen_age + 10\n\n# Print Allen's age 10 years from now\nprint(\"Allen's age 10 years from now is:\", allen_age_10_years)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Verify the Calculation of \\(x\\):** \n   - The equation is correct: \\(18x = 162\\).\n   - Solving for \\(x\\) gives us \\(x = 9\\).\n\n2. **Verify Ages:**\n   - Darrell's age is \\(7 \\times 9 = 63\\).\n   - Allen's age is \\(11 \\times 9 = 99\\).\n   - Check sum: \\(63 + 99 = 162\\), which matches the given total.\n\n3. **Calculate Allen's Future Age:**\n   - Allen's age in 10 years: \\(99 + 10 = 109\\).\n\nThe calculations are consistent and verified. Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{109}\n\\]"
