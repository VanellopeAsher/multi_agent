Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  The alcohol content of cognac is 15% stronger than scotch.  How much does he spend on everything?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost for both the scotch and the cognac John buys, and then sum these costs to find the total expenditure.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of One Bottle of Scotch:**\n   - The total cost for 10 bottles of scotch is $600.\n   - Cost of one bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles = \\( \\frac{600}{10} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Price of One Bottle of Cognac:**\n   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more expensive than a bottle of scotch.\n   - Price of one bottle of cognac = Cost of one bottle of scotch + 50% of the cost of one bottle of scotch\n   - \\( \\text{Cost of one bottle of cognac} = \\text{Cost of one bottle of scotch} \\times 1.5 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Cognac Bottles:**\n   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.\n   - Number of cognac bottles = \\( 2 \\times \\text{Number of scotch bottles} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Cost of Cognac:**\n   - Total cost for cognac = Number of cognac bottles \\(\\times\\) Price of one bottle of cognac.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Expenditure:**\n   - Total cost = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac.\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python with the `sympy` library to ensure precision in mathematical operations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given values\ntotal_cost_scotch = 600  # Total cost for scotch\nnum_bottles_scotch = 10  # Number of scotch bottles\nprice_increase_rate = Rational(3, 2)  # Cognac is 50% more expensive, i.e., 1.5 times\n\n# Calculate cost per bottle of scotch\ncost_per_bottle_scotch = Rational(total_cost_scotch, num_bottles_scotch)\n\n# Calculate the price per bottle of cognac\ncost_per_bottle_cognac = cost_per_bottle_scotch * price_increase_rate\n\n# Number of cognac bottles\nnum_bottles_cognac = 2 * num_bottles_scotch  # Twice as many bottles\n\n# Calculate total cost for cognac\ntotal_cost_cognac = num_bottles_cognac * cost_per_bottle_cognac\n\n# Calculate total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = total_cost_scotch + total_cost_cognac\n\n# Print the total expenditure\nprint(\"Total expenditure on scotch and cognac is:\", total_expenditure)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\nLet's verify each step:\n- The cost of a single scotch bottle is \\( \\frac{600}{10} = 60 \\).\n- The cost per cognac bottle is \\( 60 \\times 1.5 = 90 \\).\n- John buys 20 cognac bottles, so the total cost for cognac is \\( 20 \\times 90 = 1800 \\).\n- Total expenditure: \\( 600 + 1800 = 2400 \\).\n\nAfter verifying each computation, we confidently present the final answer:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]"
