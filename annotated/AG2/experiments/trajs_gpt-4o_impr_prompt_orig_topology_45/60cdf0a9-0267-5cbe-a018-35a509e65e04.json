Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Total Number of Crayons:**\n   - Kate has 3 boxes, each containing 64 crayons.\n   - Total number of crayons = \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\) crayons.\n\n2. **Make Crayon Muffins:**\n   - Each muffin is made by melting 8 crayons together.\n   - The number of muffin crayons Kate can make is determined by dividing the total number of crayons by 8.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Muffins:**\n   - Total muffins = Total crayons / Crayons per muffin\n   - Total muffins = \\(192 / 8 = 24\\) muffins.\n\n4. **Determine the Selling Price of Each Muffin:**\n   - Kate sells all her muffins for $36.\n   - Price per muffin = Total sales / Number of muffins\n   - Price per muffin = \\(36 / 24\\).\n\nLet's use Python to calculate the price per muffin:\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64  # Total crayons = number of boxes * crayons per box\ncrayons_per_muffin = 8\ntotal_muffins = total_crayons // crayons_per_muffin\ntotal_sales = 36\n\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(total_sales, total_muffins)\n\n# Print the price per muffin in fractional form\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n- Total crayons: 192\n- Total muffins: 192 / 8 = 24\n- Total sales: $36\n- Price per muffin: 36 / 24 = 3/2 or $1.50\n\nCompleting the above checks, we can confirm that the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the price each muffin crayon sells for is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \\] \n\nor $1.50."
