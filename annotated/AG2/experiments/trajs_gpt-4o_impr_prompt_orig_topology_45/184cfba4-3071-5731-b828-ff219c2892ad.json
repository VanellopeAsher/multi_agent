Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow the step-by-step process since it involves setting up an equation based on the given information.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n   - The number of small stuffed animals sold will be \\( 2x \\) because Teresa sold twice as many small animals as large ones.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - Each small stuffed animal costs $40, so the total revenue from small stuffed animals is \\( 40 \\times 2x \\).\n   - Each large stuffed animal sells for three times the price of a small one. Therefore, each large stuffed animal costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) dollars. The total revenue from large stuffed animals is \\( 120 \\times x \\).\n   - The total sales amount to $1200, so we can set up the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 2x + 120 \\times x = 1200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Create the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(40 * 2 * x + 120 * x, 1200)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Calculate the number of small stuffed animals sold\nnum_small_animals = 2 * solution[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(num_small_animals)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Verify the Solution Calculations:**\n   - Solve \\( 40 \\times 2x + 120 \\times x = 1200 \\).\n   - Combine the terms: \\( 80x + 120x = 1200 \\).\n   - Simplify the equation: \\( 200x = 1200 \\).\n   - Solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Verify the Number of Small Stuffed Animals:**\n   - If \\( x = 6 \\), then the number of small animals sold is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Verify the Total Revenue:**\n   - Revenue from small animals: \\( 12 \\times 40 = 480 \\).\n   - Revenue from large animals: \\( 6 \\times 120 = 720 \\).\n   - Total revenue: \\( 480 + 720 = 1200 \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\nSince all verifications are correct, we conclude the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
