Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSam ran 3.5 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5.5 miles.  How many miles did Sam run this week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of miles Sam ran over the course of the week. Here's how we'll tackle it based on the outlined format:\n\n### Key Idea\nEach day of Sam's running schedule is associated with a specific number of miles run:\n- **Monday, Wednesday, Friday**: 3.5 miles per day\n- **Tuesday, Thursday**: 5.5 miles per day\n\nWe need to add up all the miles run on these days to find the total for the week.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. Calculate the total miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\n2. Calculate the total miles run on Tuesday and Thursday.\n3. Sum up the results from steps 1 and 2 to get the total weekly mileage.\n\nNow, we'll compute these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Miles run each day\nmiles_mon_wed_fri = Rational(7, 2)  # 3.5 miles using fraction\nmiles_tue_thu = Rational(11, 2)     # 5.5 miles using fraction\n\n# Calculate total miles\ntotal_mon_wed_fri = 3 * miles_mon_wed_fri  # 3 days \ntotal_tue_thu = 2 * miles_tue_thu          # 2 days\n\n# Total weekly miles\ntotal_weekly_miles = total_mon_wed_fri + total_tue_thu\n\nprint(total_weekly_miles)\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet's verify each step:\n- **Steps 1 and 2**: Check the calculation of miles:\n  - \\(3 \\text{ days} \\times 3.5 \\text{ miles/day} = 10.5 \\text{ miles}\\)\n  - \\(2 \\text{ days} \\times 5.5 \\text{ miles/day} = 11 \\text{ miles}\\)\n\n- **Step 3**: Add the results:\n  \\[\n  10.5 \\text{ miles} + 11 \\text{ miles} = 21.5 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\nEverything checks out correctly. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21.5} \\]"
