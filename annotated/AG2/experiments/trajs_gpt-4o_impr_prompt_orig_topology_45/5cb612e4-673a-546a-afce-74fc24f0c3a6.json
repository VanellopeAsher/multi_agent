Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags of wheat the trader sold, given the purchase cost, transportation cost, selling price, and profit. Let's solve this by breaking it down into manageable steps and using Python to simplify the process.\n\n### Key Idea\nThe trader's total cost for each bag includes both the purchase and transportation costs. We can use this information to calculate the total cost for all purchased bags. Knowing the profit and selling price for all bags allows us to set up an equation to find the total number of bags sold.\n\n### Steps\n1. Determine the cost per bag: \n   - Purchase cost per bag: $20\n   - Transportation cost per bag: $2\n   - Total cost per bag = $20 + $2 = $22\n\n2. Set up an equation to calculate the number of bags sold:\n   - Selling price per bag: $30\n   - Let the number of bags sold be \\( n \\).\n   - Total cost for \\( n \\) bags: \\( 22n \\)\n   - Total revenue from selling \\( n \\) bags: \\( 30n \\)\n   - Profit: Revenue - Cost\n   - Given profit: $400\n\n   This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   30n - 22n = 400\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( n \\) using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Declare the variable\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(30 * n - 22 * n, 400)\n\n# Solve for n\nnumber_of_bags_sold = solve(equation, n)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The number of bags sold is: {number_of_bags_sold}\")\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet's verify our solution step-by-step.\n1. **Calculate Total Cost**: Each bag costs $22 in total. Thus, purchasing \\( n \\) bags costs \\( 22n \\).\n2. **Calculate Total Revenue**: Selling \\( n \\) bags at $30 each generates \\( 30n \\) in revenue.\n3. **Compute Profit**:\n   - Profit is calculated as \\( 30n - 22n = 8n \\).\n   - Setting \\( 8n = 400 \\) yields \\( n = 50 \\), which matches our calculation.\n\nThe calculation steps are consistent and verify that the result is indeed correct. The trader sold \\(\\boxed{50}\\) bags."
