Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. If the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length, how long is the shark?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the shark based on the information about the remoras attached to it.\n\n### Key Concept\nThe total length of the remoras is 12 inches (since there are two 6-inch remoras). This combined length represents 10% of the shark's body length. Our task is to find out the total length of the shark.\n\n### Structured Approach\nLet's denote the length of the shark as \\( L \\).\n\n1. **Set up the equation**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{(Length of remoras)} = \\frac{10}{100} \\times L\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given length of the remoras:\n   \\[\n   12 = \\frac{10}{100} \\times L\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\( L \\) using Python**:\n   We'll use the sympy library to solve this equation because it will help us keep our values in fractions or exact forms as required.\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the shark's length\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Equation representing the problem\nequation = Eq(12, (10/100) * L)\n\n# Solve for the shark's length\nshark_length = solve(equation, L)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Equation Setup**: We confirmed that the equation \\( 12 = \\frac{10}{100} \\times L \\) is correctly set up according to the problem statement.\n2. **Solution Verification**: By solving the equation, we verified that the computations performed are accurate.\n\nThe length of the shark is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]\n\nThis solution has been verified step-by-step, checking the logic and calculations thoroughly."
