Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the water depth for each day from Monday to Thursday using Python with symbolic computation. We will utilize Sympy, which allows us to perform exact calculations and simplify expressions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational\n\n# Define Monday's water depth\ndepth_monday = 17  # in feet\n\n# Calculate Tuesday's water depth\ndepth_tuesday = depth_monday + 7\n\n# Calculate Wednesday's water depth (two thirds of Tuesday's depth)\ndepth_wednesday = Rational(2, 3) * depth_tuesday\n\n# Calculate the change in depth from Tuesday to Wednesday\ndepth_change = depth_tuesday - depth_wednesday\n\n# Calculate Thursday's water depth (increased by half the difference between Tuesday and Wednesday)\ndepth_thursday = depth_wednesday + Rational(1, 2) * depth_change\n\n# Print the Thursday's water depth using fraction for the exact value\nprint(\"Thursday's water depth is:\", depth_thursday)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Define Symbols and Initial Data**:\n   - We start by defining the depth of water on Monday.\n\n2. **Tuesday's Calculation**:\n   - On Tuesday, the water is 7 feet more than on Monday.\n\n3. **Wednesday's Calculation**:\n   - On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Hence, we multiply Tuesday's depth by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n4. **Difference Calculation**:\n   - We find the difference in depth between Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n5. **Thursday's Calculation**:\n   - Finally, Thursday's water depth is the depth on Wednesday plus half the difference calculated above.\n\n6. **Print the Result**:\n   - We print Thursday's water depth in fractional form to maintain precision.\n\nLet’s compute the Thursday’s water depth:\n\n1. **Compute Tuesday's depth**:  \n   \\( \\text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \\) feet.\n\n2. **Compute Wednesday's depth**:\n   \\[ \\text{Depth on Wednesday} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = 16 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n3. **Compute the difference**:\n   \\[ \\text{Difference} = 24 - 16 = 8 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n4. **Compute Thursday's depth**:\n   \\[ \\text{Depth on Thursday} = 16 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 16 + 4 = 20 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n### Final Verification:\n1. We calculated each day’s depth accurately using precise fractions.\n2. We re-evaluated Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday computations step-by-step.\n\nThus, the tank’s water depth on Thursday is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
