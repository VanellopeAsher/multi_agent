Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDerrick has a bakery that makes doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut. How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Derrick makes in June from selling doughnuts at $2 each.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach\n\nWe'll follow Case 1: Direct Python Solution, as this problem is suitable for straightforward calculations using basic arithmetic with Python.\n\n### Breakdown of the Problem\n\n1. **Identify the number of days in June:** June has 30 days.\n2. **Determine the number of doughnuts made and sold:** This information is missing from the problem statement. We need the average number of doughnuts Derrick sells per day to calculate the total revenue for June.\n3. **Calculate the total revenue:** Multiply the number of doughnuts sold in a month by the price per doughnut ($2).\n\nSince the number of doughnuts sold per day is not provided, this problem cannot be solved without that data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the problem statement provided without additional data, here is the solution indicating that more data is necessary:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None}} \\]\n\nIf you can provide the average number of doughnuts sold per day, we can proceed with the calculations."
