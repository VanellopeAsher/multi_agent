Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 2000 helmets, calculate the total number of items Dominick saw."

Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the relationships**:\n   - There are **2000 helmets**.\n   - There are **half as many robots as helmets**.\n   - There are **half as many helmets as footballs**.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of each item**:\n   - **Number of robots** = number of helmets / 2\n   - **Number of footballs** = number of helmets * 2\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of items**:\n   - Total items = number of robots + number of helmets + number of footballs\n\nLet's code this in Python using the guidelines provided:\n\n```python\n# Given data\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# Calculating number of robots and footballs\nrobots = helmets / 2  # Since there are half as many robots as helmets\nfootballs = helmets * 2  # Since there are half as many helmets as footballs\n\n# Calculating the total number of items seen\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_items)\n```\n\nLet's break down each step in the VERIFICATION section to ensure clarity:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the number of robots**:\n   - Robots = \\( \\frac{2000}{2} = 1000 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the number of footballs**:\n   - Footballs = \\( 2000 \\times 2 = 4000 \\)\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of items**:\n   - Total items = Robots + Helmets + Footballs\n   - Total items = \\( 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000 \\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is \\(\\boxed{7000}\\)."
