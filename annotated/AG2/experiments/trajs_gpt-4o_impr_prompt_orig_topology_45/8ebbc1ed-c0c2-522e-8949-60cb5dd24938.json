      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow a structured approach that fits Case 1: Direct Python Solution.\n\n### Key Idea and Steps\n\n- The teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk initially.\n- The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.\n- Normally, he uses 20% of the chalk each day.\n- We need to find how many days he can use the chalk until it becomes smaller than 2 inches.\n\n### Solution Process\n\n1. **Calculate the length of chalk after Monday:**\n   - Initially 5 inches, and 45% is used. So, 55% is left.\n\n2. **Determine how the chalk length changes with standard daily use:**\n   - Each day, 20% of the current length is used after Monday.\n\n3. **Iterate each day to see how long the chalk lasts before it becomes less than 2 inches.**\n\nWe'll implement this using Python, particularly utilizing basic arithmetic to iterate and calculate the chalk length.\n\n```python\n# Start with the initial length of chalk\ntotal_length = 5  # initial 5 inches\n\n# Length after using 45% on Monday\ntotal_length -= 0.45 * total_length\n\n# Daily usage rate\ndaily_usage_rate = 0.20\n\n# Number of days the teacher can use the chalk\ndays = 0\n\n# Calculate how many days till the chalk is less than 2 inches\nwhile total_length >= 2:\n    total_length -= daily_usage_rate * total_length\n    days += 1\n\n# Output the number of days the teacher can use the chalk\nprint(days)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nWe'll go through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Reduction on Monday:**\n   - From 5 inches, 45% usage: \\( 5 \\times 0.45 = 2.25 \\), so \\( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \\) inches remain.\n\n2. **Iterate daily usage:**\n   - Day 1: Before 2.75 inches, use 0.55, leaves 2.20 inches\n   - Day 2: Before 2.20, use 0.44, leaves 1.76 inches (less than 2 inches, stop.)\n\nThe chalk lasts for 1 full day after Monday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{1}\\)"
