Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16. What will be her age after 4 years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a logical reasoning approach to determine Charmaine's current age and predict her age in 4 years.\n\n**Key Concept:**\n\nWe need to calculate her current age and then add 4 years to determine her age after 4 years. Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate Charmaine's Current Age:**\n   - We know that Charmaine will turn 16 in 12 years. \n   - Therefore, her current age is \\(16 - 12 = 4\\) years.\n\n2. **Determine Her Age After 4 Years:**\n   - Charmaine's current age is 4 years.\n   - After 4 more years, her age will be \\(4 + 4 = 8\\) years.\n\nSince this problem primarily involves simple reasoning, we don't need to use Python code to solve it. However, let's confirm the solution using a small Python script for practice.\n\n```python\n# Define her current age based on the information given\ncurrent_age = 16 - 12\n\n# Calculate her age in 4 years\nage_in_4_years = current_age + 4\n\n# Print her age in 4 years\nprint(age_in_4_years)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Current age is calculated as 16 minus 12, giving us 4.\n2. Adding 4 years to her current age of 4 confirms that she will be 8.\n\nAfter checking the calculations:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\] \n\nThus, Charmaine will be 8 years old after 4 years."
