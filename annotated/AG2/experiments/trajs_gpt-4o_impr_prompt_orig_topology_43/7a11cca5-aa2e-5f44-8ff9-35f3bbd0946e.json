Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

Let's follow the problem-solving approach:\n\n### Key Concept\nWe need to calculate the difference in the amount of water passing through the river on the third day compared to the previous day after it doubled.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initial Condition**:\n   - On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.\n\n2. **After Day of Heavy Rain (Second Day)**:\n   - The water amount doubles. So, on the second day:\n   \n     \\[\n     \\text{Second day} = 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\n3. **On the Third Day**:\n   - We know the total amount is 14000 gallons.\n   - To find the increase on the third day, subtract the amount from the second day from the third day's total:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Increase on third day} = 14000 - 8000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   - Simplifying the above equation:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Increase on third day} = 14000 - 8000 = 6000 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation process using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy for symbolic mathematics (though not strictly necessary for this task)\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the amounts for each day\nfirst_day_amount = 4000  # gallons\nsecond_day_amount = 2 * first_day_amount\nthird_day_total_amount = 14000  # gallons\n\n# Calculate the increase on the third day\nincrease_third_day = third_day_total_amount - second_day_amount\n\n# Display the result using prints\nprint(f'The increase in the amount of water on the third day is {increase_third_day} gallons.')\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Check Calculations**: Ensure that doubling is correct: \\(8000\\) gallons on the second day is indeed double of \\(4000\\).\n2. **Confirm Final Result**: Verify that subtracting \\(8000\\) from \\(14000\\) gives \\(6000\\).\n  \nAll steps are logical and numerical calculations align correctly.\n\nTherefore, the increase in the amount of water on the third day is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6000}\n\\]"
