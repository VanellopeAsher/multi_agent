Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays on her debts each month if she pays 50% more than the minimum payments. Then, we can find out how much she pays in a year.\n\nLet's address this systematically:\n\n1. **Identify the Minimum Monthly Payments:**\n   - Student Loans: $3000 per month\n   - Credit Card: $2000 per month\n   - Mortgage: $5000 per month\n\n2. **Calculate the Additional Payment:**\n   - Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for each of these debts.\n   - Additional payment = Minimum payment × 50%\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Monthly Payment:**\n   - Total Monthly Payment = Minimum payment + Additional payment\n   - Since Additional payment = Minimum payment × 50%, then\n   - Total Monthly Payment = 1.5 × Minimum payment\n\n4. **Compute the Yearly Payment:**\n   - Yearly payment is the sum of the total monthly payments for all debts over 12 months.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Minimum payments per month\nstudent_loan_payment = 3000\ncredit_card_payment = 2000\nmortgage_payment = 5000\n\n# Paying 50% more than the minimum, therefore multiply each by 1.5\nmonthly_student_loan_payment = student_loan_payment * Rational(3, 2)\nmonthly_credit_card_payment = credit_card_payment * Rational(3, 2)\nmonthly_mortgage_payment = mortgage_payment * Rational(3, 2)\n\n# Total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = (\n    monthly_student_loan_payment +\n    monthly_credit_card_payment +\n    monthly_mortgage_payment\n)\n\n# Total yearly payment\nyearly_payment = 12 * total_monthly_payment\n\n# Output the result as a rational number\nprint(yearly_payment)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Individual Payment Check:**\n   - Student Loans: \\(3000 \\times 1.5 = 4500\\) per month\n   - Credit Card: \\(2000 \\times 1.5 = 3000\\) per month\n   - Mortgage: \\(5000 \\times 1.5 = 7500\\) per month\n\n2. **Total Monthly Payment Calculation:**\n   - \\(4500 + 3000 + 7500 = 15000\\)\n\n3. **Yearly Payment Calculation:**\n   - \\(15000 \\times 12 = 180000\\)\n\nThe calculations match the expected results. Therefore, the yearly payment amount that Jessica pays, with the 50% increase on all her debts, is \\(\\boxed{180000}\\)."
