  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total weight of all the feed, then determine how many pounds the farm truck can carry per trip given that it needs to transport all the feed in two trips.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of each type of feed:**\n   - **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound, for a total of \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) pounds.\n   - **Carrots:** 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds, for a total of \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) pounds.\n   - **Hay:** 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds, for a total of \\(42 \\times 75 = 3150\\) pounds.\n   - **Oats:** 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds, for a total of \\(20 \\times 65 = 1300\\) pounds.\n\n2. **Sum the total weight of all the feed:**\n   - Total weight = weight of sugar cubes + weight of carrots + weight of hay + weight of oats\n   \nNow, let's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary sympy package\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Initialize the weights\nsugar_weight = 2 * 1  # Sugar cubes\ncarrot_weight = 4 * 12  # Carrots\nhay_weight = 42 * 75  # Hay\noat_weight = 20 * 65  # Oats\n\n# Calculate total weight\ntotal_weight = sugar_weight + carrot_weight + hay_weight + oat_weight\n\n# Since the farmer needs to make two trips, calculate the weight for one trip\ntruck_capacity_per_trip = total_weight / 2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(truck_capacity_per_trip)\n```\n\nLet's go through the calculations and print the results:\n\n- **Sugar cubes:** \\(2 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n- **Carrots:** \\(48 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n- **Hay:** \\(3150 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n- **Oats:** \\(1300 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n- **Total weight:** \\( 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n\nGiven that the total weight is 4500 pounds, and the farmer needs two trips:\n\n- \\( \\text{Truck capacity per trip} = \\frac{4500}{2} = 2250 \\, \\text{pounds} \\)\n\nSo, the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.\n\nLet's present the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2250}\n\\]"
