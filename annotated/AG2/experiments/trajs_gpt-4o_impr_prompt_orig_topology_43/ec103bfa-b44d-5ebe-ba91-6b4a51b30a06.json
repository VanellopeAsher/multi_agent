Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps to calculate the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered.\n\n**Given:**\n- The cost of one chicken meal: $120\n- The cost of one pack of milk: $30\n- The cost of one apple: $1.50\n- Each pizza box costs: $57\n- Total amount paid: $900\n\n**Marie ordered:**\n- 1 chicken meal\n- 5 packs of milk\n- 40 apples\n- Some boxes of pizza\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the milk packs.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the apples.\n4. Determine the remaining amount for the pizza boxes.\n5. Calculate how many pizza boxes are ordered by dividing the remaining amount by the cost per pizza box.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the given values:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary library to work with fractions for accuracy\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs and quantities\nchicken_meal_cost = 120\nmilk_pack_cost = 30\nnumber_of_milk_packs = 5\napple_cost = Rational(3, 2)  # $1.5 as a fraction\nnumber_of_apples = 40\npizza_box_cost = 57\ntotal_paid = 900\n\n# Calculate total costs\ntotal_chicken_meal_cost = chicken_meal_cost\ntotal_milk_cost = milk_pack_cost * number_of_milk_packs\ntotal_apple_cost = apple_cost * number_of_apples\n\n# Calculate cost without pizzas\ntotal_excluding_pizzas = total_chicken_meal_cost + total_milk_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# Remaining money for pizza\nremaining_money_for_pizzas = total_paid - total_excluding_pizzas\n\n# Calculate number of pizza boxes\nnumber_of_pizza_boxes = remaining_money_for_pizzas / pizza_box_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Number of pizza boxes ordered:\", number_of_pizza_boxes)\n```\n\nLet's go through the steps in the code to ensure everything is correct:\n\n- We calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples.\n- We subtract these from the total amount Marie paid to find the amount remaining for pizza boxes.\n- We divide the remaining amount by the cost per pizza box to find the number of pizzas ordered.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Chicken Meal Cost:** $120.\n2. **Milk Cost:** \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\).\n3. **Apple Cost:** \\(40 \\times 1.5 = 60\\).\n4. **Total Excluding Pizzas:** \\(120 + 150 + 60 = 330\\).\n5. **Remaining for Pizzas:** \\(900 - 330 = 570\\).\n6. **Pizza Boxes:** \\(570 \\div 57 = 10\\).\n\nThe calculations verify that Marie ordered \\(\\boxed{10}\\) pizza boxes."
