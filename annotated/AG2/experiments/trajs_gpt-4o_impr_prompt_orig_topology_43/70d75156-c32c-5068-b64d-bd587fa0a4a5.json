Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMrs. Harrington bought several boxes of oranges at the market. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Then she kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest. How many oranges did Mrs. Harrington sell if each box contains 20 oranges?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Total Oranges**: Let's denote the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Oranges Distributed**:\n   - She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, making a total of \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) boxes given away.\n   - Each box contains 20 oranges, so she gave away \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\) oranges.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Boxes**: \n   - After giving away the 4 boxes, she had \\( x - 4 \\) boxes left.\n\n4. **Determine Oranges Kept and Sold**:\n   - She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.\n   - Therefore, she kept \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20(x - 4) \\) oranges.\n\n5. **Calculate Oranges Sold**:\n   - The rest of the oranges, after keeping her share, were sold.\n   - Therefore, she sold \\( 20(x - 4) - \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20(x - 4) \\) oranges.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code using the sympy library to calculate the number of oranges sold:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define x as a symbolic variable representing the number of boxes\nx = symbols('x', real=True, positive=True)\n\n# Calculate the number of oranges left after giving 4 boxes away\noranges_left = 20 * (x - 4)\n\n# Calculate the number of oranges kept (1/4 of the remaining oranges)\noranges_kept = 1/4 * oranges_left\n\n# Calculate the number of oranges sold\noranges_sold = oranges_left - oranges_kept\n\n# Simplify the expression\noranges_sold_simplified = simplify(oranges_sold)\n\n# Print the expression for oranges sold\nprint(oranges_sold_simplified)\n```\n\nRun the above code to find the symbolic expression giving the number of oranges sold. From there, if needed, substitute any specific number of initial boxes if given another problem context.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\nLet's verify each calculated part:\n1. **Oranges Given Away**: Correct, as \\( 4 \\) boxes, each with \\( 20 \\) oranges makes 80 oranges given away.\n2. **Oranges Left Calculation**: Logical step from total minus given.\n3. **Oranges Kept**: Calculation is consistent with the statement \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the remaining.\n4. **Oranges Sold**: Consistent with selling the remaining after keeping.\n\nIf the symbolic expression is correct, it will provide the result that \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the remaining oranges were sold, which is \\( 15(x - 4) \\), representing the number of boxes multiplied by the oranges sold per box after giving away part of them and keeping a fourth.\n\nIf any numerical substitution or example numbers appear or further context given, replace \\( x \\) with the respective value."

      "content": "The expression \\( 15.0x - 60.0 \\) gives the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, in terms of \\( x \\), the number of boxes she initially bought.\n\nGiven our understanding:\n- Mrs. Harrington bought \\( x \\) boxes.\n- She gave away 4 boxes.\n- She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.\n\nTherefore, she sold \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the remaining oranges from \\( x - 4 \\) boxes, which simplifies to \\( 15.0x - 60.0 \\) when considering each box contains 20 oranges.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Calculate Oranges Left After Giving Away:**\n   - Oranges in initial \\( x - 4 \\) boxes: \\( 20(x - 4) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Oranges She Kept:**\n   - Kept \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of \\( 20(x - 4) \\): \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20(x - 4) = 5(x - 4) \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Oranges Sold:**\n   - Sold \\( 20(x - 4) - 5(x - 4) = 15(x - 4) \\).\n\nThus, confirming the expression for oranges sold:\n\n\\[\n15.0x - 60.0\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer Boxed:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{15(x - 4)}\\) or \\(\\boxed{15.0x - 60.0}\\)\n\nThis expression represents the total oranges sold based on the initial number of boxes \\( x \\).
