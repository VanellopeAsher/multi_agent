      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full three times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Elise has written by following the given instructions. Here's the structured approach:\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Letters Written Initially:**\n   - The alphabet has 26 letters.\n   - Elise writes the full alphabet three times: \\(3 \\times 26\\).\n   - She then writes half of the alphabet once: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Letters Written Initially:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total letters written initially} = 3 \\times 26 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rewrite the Initial Total:**\n   - After writing the initial set of letters, Elise rewrites everything she has already written.\n   - Therefore, the new total number of letters will be twice the initially calculated amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total letters written} = 2 \\times \\left( 3 \\times 26 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 \\right)\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python to find the exact total:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the number of letters\ntotal_letters_initially = 3 * 26 + Rational(1, 2) * 26\ntotal_letters = 2 * total_letters_initially\n\n# Print result\nprint(total_letters)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Recalculate Step-by-Step:**\n   - Total letters written initially: \n     \\[\n     3 \\times 26 = 78\n     \\]\n   - Half of the alphabet:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 = 13\n     \\]\n   - Sum of above:\n     \\[\n     78 + 13 = 91\n     \\]\n\n2. **Rewrite Everything:**\n   - Twice the initial total:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 91 = 182\n     \\]\n\nThe calculations are consistent, and the program will print the number 182 as the total letters written.\n\n\\(\\boxed{182}\\)"
