Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll utilize the approach of breaking down the provided information into manageable equations. This is a Case 1: Direct Python Solution problem since we can directly write a Python script to calculate the answer.\n\nHere's the process we will follow:\n\n1. Define variables for the number of small stuffed animals and large stuffed animals sold.\n2. Establish relationships among these variables based on the problem statement.\n3. Form a system of equations based on the provided information about prices, quantities, and total earnings.\n4. Solve the equations using Python to find the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n\nLet's translate the word problem into mathematical equations:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n- The price of a small stuffed animal is $40.\n- The price of a large stuffed animal is three times that of a small one, which is \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\).\n- Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\( x = 2y \\).\n- The total earnings are $1200: \\( 40x + 120y = 1200 \\).\n\nNow we'll solve this system of equations:\n1. \\( x = 2y \\)\n2. \\( 40x + 120y = 1200 \\)\n\nLet's use Python with the sympy library to solve these equations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\neq1 = Eq(x, 2 * y)  # x = 2y\neq2 = Eq(40 * x + 120 * y, 1200)  # 40x + 120y = 1200\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# Extract the number of small stuffed animals sold\nnumber_of_small_stuffed_animals = solution[x]\n\n# Output the result using the required print function\nprint(number_of_small_stuffed_animals)\n```\n\nBy executing this code, we'll find out how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold. Let's compute this and ensure the result is correct.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Solve \\( x = 2y \\) and \\( 40x + 120y = 1200 \\).\n- Substituting \\( x = 2y \\) into \\( 40x + 120y = 1200 \\), we have:\n\n  \\[\n  40(2y) + 120y = 1200 \\Rightarrow 80y + 120y = 1200 \\Rightarrow 200y = 1200 \\Rightarrow y = 6\n  \\]\n\n- Since \\( x = 2y \\), \\( x = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\).\n\n- Thus, the number of small stuffed animals sold:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
