Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 60 feet, and the second tree has a height of 50 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the tallest tree given the heights of the other two trees and their relationships. Let's outline the approach and solve the problem using Python.\n\nKey Idea:\n- We will first use the given information to find the height of the second tree.\n- Then, we will use this information to find the combined height of the shortest and second trees.\n- Finally, since the tallest tree's height is twice the combined height of the other two trees, we will compute the height of the tallest tree.\n\nBreakdown of the problem:\n\n1. Let \\( h_1 \\) be the height of the shortest tree, which is 60 feet.\n2. According to the problem statement, the second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree, \\( h_2 \\), is \\( h_1 + 50 \\) feet.\n3. The combined height of the shortest and second trees is \\( h_1 + h_2 \\).\n4. The tallest tree is twice this combined height.\n\nLet's now calculate this using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the height of the shortest tree\nh1 = 60  # shortest tree height in feet\n\n# Calculate the height of the second tree\nh2 = h1 + 50\n\n# Calculate the combined height of the first and second trees\ncombined_height = h1 + h2\n\n# Define the height of the tallest tree, h3\nh3 = 2 * combined_height\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The tallest tree is {h3} feet tall.\")\n```\n\nLet's perform a verification to ensure our calculations are correct.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. The shortest tree: \\( h_1 = 60 \\) feet.\n2. The second tree: \\( h_2 = h_1 + 50 = 60 + 50 = 110 \\) feet.\n3. Combined height of the shortest and second trees: \\( 60 + 110 = 170 \\) feet.\n4. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree: \\( 2 \\times 170 = 340 \\) feet.\n\nAll calculations check out, and we have verified each step.\n\nThus, the height of the tallest tree is \\( \\boxed{340} \\) feet."
