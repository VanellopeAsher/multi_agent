Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a simple reasoning-based approach. \n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Distribution of Eggs**:\n   - The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. Since there are 2 twins, they found a total of \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\) eggs.\n   \n2. **Determine the Eggs Found by Friends**:\n   - We know that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means, out of the total eggs hidden, 10 eggs were not found by anyone.\n\n3. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   - If \\( x \\) represents the total number of eggs hidden, then the number of eggs found by their friends, \\( y \\), would be:\n     \\[\n     y = x - 60 - 10\n     \\]\n   - The equation simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     y = x - 70\n     \\]\n   - To find the number of eggs \\( y \\) the friends found, we need to know the total number of eggs hidden. However, this information seems to be missing.\n\nIn this scenario, with the lack of total eggs information, the problem is unsolvable as is. According to our procedure for handling missing data, we conclude:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\]"
