Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $300 every day. He worked for an entire week and spent a total of $1000. How much does he have left?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how much money Gerald has left after spending some of his earnings, we can follow Case 1: Direct Python Solution. We will calculate his earnings for the week and then subtract his expenses to find the remaining amount.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week.\n2. Subtract his expenses from his total earnings.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Number of days Gerald worked in a week\ndays_worked = 7\n\n# Daily earning\ndaily_earning = 300\n\n# Total earnings for the week\ntotal_earnings = days_worked * daily_earning\n\n# Total expenditure\nexpenditure = 1000\n\n# Amount left after expenditure\namount_left = total_earnings - expenditure\n\n# Display the result\nprint(amount_left)\n```\n\nUpon executing this code, we will obtain the amount of money Gerald has left. Let's perform these calculations:\n\n- Gerald worked for 7 days.\n- His earnings per day are $300.\n\nCalculating total earnings:\n\\[ \\text{Total earnings} = 7 \\times 300 = 2100 \\]\n\nSubtracting his expenses:\n\\[ \\text{Amount left} = 2100 - 1000 = 1100 \\]\n\nThus, the remaining balance after Gerald's expenditures is \\( \\boxed{1100} \\).\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Earnings Calculation**: \n   - Verified: \\( 7 \\times 300 = 2100 \\) is correct.\n2. **Subtraction**: \n   - Verified: \\( 2100 - 1000 = 1100 \\) is correct.\n\nEvery step of the calculation was verified, and the final, correct answer is \\( \\boxed{1100} \\)."
