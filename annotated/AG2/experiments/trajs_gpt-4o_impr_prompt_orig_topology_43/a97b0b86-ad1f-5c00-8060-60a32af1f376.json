Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $52.5. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?"

      "content": "To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we should first compute the total cost of the items she ordered (other than the pizza) and then use the remaining amount to find the number of pizza boxes.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach: Step-by-step Process\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples.\n2. Subtract this total from the amount Marie paid.\n3. Use the remaining amount to calculate the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, given the cost per box.\n\nLet's break it down with Python code and solve this step-by-step.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs of items\ncost_chicken_meal = Rational(12)\ncost_milk_pack = Rational(7, 2)  # $3.50 as a fraction\ncost_apple = Rational(3, 2)      # $1.50 as a fraction\ncost_pizza_box = Rational(17, 2) # $8.50 as a fraction\n\n# Quantities ordered\nnum_milk_packs = 5\nnum_apples = 4\n\n# Total amount paid\ntotal_paid = Rational(105, 2)  # $52.50 as a fraction\n\n# Calculate total cost of items other than pizza\ntotal_cost_other_items = (cost_chicken_meal +\n                          num_milk_packs * cost_milk_pack +\n                          num_apples * cost_apple)\n\n# Remaining money for pizza\nremaining_money = total_paid - total_cost_other_items\n\n# Calculate the number of pizza boxes\nnum_pizza_boxes = remaining_money / cost_pizza_box\n\n# Output the result\nprint(num_pizza_boxes)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- First, we convert all monetary values to fractions for precision.\n- We calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples.\n- We subtract this from the total amount paid to get the amount spent on pizza.\n- Finally, we divide the remaining money by the cost per box of pizza to find the number of boxes ordered.\n\nExecuting the code will give us the number of pizza boxes as an output. Let's verify this calculation.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Total cost of chicken meal: $12\n2. Total cost of milk packs (5 packs at $3.50 each): \\(5 \\times 3.5 = 17.5\\) dollars\n3. Total cost of apples (4 apples at $1.50 each): \\(4 \\times 1.5 = 6\\) dollars\n4. Total cost of items (without pizza): \\(12 + 17.5 + 6 = 35.5\\) dollars\n5. Amount for pizza: \\(52.5 - 35.5 = 17\\) dollars\n6. Number of pizza boxes: \\( \\frac{17}{8.5} = 2\\) boxes\n\nEach step checks out, confirming that the math and logic are correct. Therefore, the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered is \\( \\boxed{2} \\)."
