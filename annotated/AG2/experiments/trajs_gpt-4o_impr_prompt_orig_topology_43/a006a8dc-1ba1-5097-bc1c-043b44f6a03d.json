Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we can employ a direct Python solution using sympy to handle symbolic expressions.\n\n**Concept:**\n\nWe know that:\n- There are 20 kids, split equally into two groups of girls and boys.\n- Each boy collected 60 seashells.\n- The girls' total collection equals the number of shells the boys gathered plus 4.5 times that amount.\n\nWith these points in mind, we have to find out how many seashells each girl collected.\n\nLet's break down the problem mathematically:\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of boys (or girls). Since there are 20 kids split equally, \\( n = 10 \\).\n- Each boy collected 60 seashells, so the total seashells collected by boys is \\( 10 \\times 60 = 600 \\).\n- If \\( g \\) is the number of seashells collected by each girl, then the total number of seashells collected by the girls can be expressed as \\( 10g \\).\n- According to the problem, the girls collected as many shells as the boys, plus 4.5 times more. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n  \\[\n  10g = 600 + 4.5 \\times 600\n  \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\ng = symbols('g')\n\n# Total seashells collected by boys\ntotal_boys_shells = 10 * 60\n\n# Set up the equation for girls' seashells\nequation = Eq(10 * g, total_boys_shells + 4.5 * total_boys_shells)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, g)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Each girl collected:\", solution[0], \"seashells\")\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Calculate total seashells collected by boys:**\n   - There are 10 boys each collecting 60 shells, so total = \\( 10 \\times 60 = 600 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate expected total from girls:**\n   - Girls should have collected \\( 600 + 4.5 \\times 600 = 600 + 2700 = 3300 \\) seashells.\n\n3. **Check girls' individual collection:**\n   - There are 10 girls, and the equation was set as \\( 10g = 3300 \\). Solving gives \\( g = 330 \\).\n   \nThus, our result is verified.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\(\\boxed{330}\\)"
