Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we start by calculating the total cost of Carly's order and then determine her change given the amount she paid. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Key Concept:\nThe problem involves calculating the total cost of items and subtracting it from the amount paid to find the change returned.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of Each Item:**\n   - Cost of one hamburger = $4\n   - Cost of five hamburgers = \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)\n\n   - Cost of one pack of fries = $0.30\n   - Cost of ten packs of fries = \\(10 \\times 0.30 = 3\\)\n\n   - We don't have the cost per can for the fruit drinks specified in the problem, which is necessary for calculating the total price.\n\n2. **Add Up the Total Cost:**\n   - Without the price of each can of fruit drink, we can't calculate the total cost correctly. Here we need that data for completion.\n\n3. **Determine the Remaining Balance:**\n   - Since crucial data regarding the pricing of the drinks is missing, the problem is unsolvable as is.\n\n### Handle Missing Data:\nGiven we have incomplete data due to the missing cost of the fruit drinks, according to the instructions, we should:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\]\n\n### Verification:\n- All steps in calculating costs for hamburgers and fries were laid out clearly; however, the unknown for the fruit drink prevents the final solution.\n- After double-checking, it's confirmed that an essential element (the cost of fruit drinks) is absent.\n\nThus, as per provided guidelines, the task remains unsolved without additional information on the drink prices."
