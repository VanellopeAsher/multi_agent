Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks, knowing she eats 3 eggs every day. We are then asked to convert this total into dozens of eggs.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in 12 weeks.\n2. Multiply the number of days by the number of eggs Claire eats per day to get the total number of eggs consumed.\n3. Convert this total into dozens, knowing that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of days in 12 weeks\nweeks = 12\ndays_per_week = 7\ntotal_days = weeks * days_per_week\n\n# Calculate the total number of eggs consumed\neggs_per_day = 3\ntotal_eggs = total_days * eggs_per_day\n\n# Convert the total number of eggs into dozens\neggs_per_dozen = 12\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / eggs_per_dozen\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Dozens of eggs consumed:\", dozens_of_eggs)\n```\n\nNow, let's perform this calculation:\n\n- Total days in 12 weeks: \\(12 \\times 7 = 84\\) days.\n- Total eggs consumed: \\(84 \\times 3 = 252\\) eggs.\n- Convert to dozens: \\(\\frac{252}{12} = 21\\) dozens.\n\nThus, Claire will consume 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Calculated the total number of days correctly: \\(12 \\times 7 = 84\\).\n2. Calculated the total number of eggs consumed correctly: \\(84 \\times 3 = 252\\).\n3. Converted to dozens correctly: \\(\\frac{252}{12} = 21\\).\n\nThe calculations have been verified and are correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{21}\\)"
