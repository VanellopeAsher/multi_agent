      "content": "To find Mark's initial weight, we can set up an equation to model his weight loss over the months.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach: Case 1: Direct Python Solution\n\n**Concept:**\nMark loses 10 pounds every month for a certain number of months. We are given his final weight and need to determine his initial weight. We use the formula for weight loss:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Weight} = \\text{Final Weight} + (\\text{Weight Lost per Month} \\times \\text{Number of Months})\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Final weight = 70 pounds\n- Weight lost per month = 10 pounds\n- Number of months = \\( n \\)\n\nLet's express his initial weight when his final weight and weight loss rate are known, and calculate it using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\ninitial_weight, months = symbols('initial_weight months')\n\n# Define the equation\nfinal_weight = 70\nweight_loss_per_month = 10\nequation = Eq(initial_weight - weight_loss_per_month * months, final_weight)\n\n# Solve for initial_weight in terms of months\nsolution = solve(equation, initial_weight)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(f\"Initial Weight = {solution[0]} + 10 * months\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- The equation `initial_weight - weight_loss_per_month * months = final_weight` accurately represents the relationship between the initial weight, weight loss, and final weight.\n- Solve the equation given the functional form: \\(\\text{Initial Weight} = \\text{Final Weight} + 10 \\times \\text{months}\\).\n- The solution provided by the code correctly illustrates the dependency of Mark's initial weight on the variable 'months'.\n\nIf Mark was ill for `n` months, his initial weight would be:\n\n```\nInitial Weight = 70 + 10 * months\n```\n\nThis solution shows that his initial weight depends on the duration (months) for which he lost weight continuously. Without the specific number of months (n), the exact numerical value is indeterminate, but the relationship is clearly defined by the equation."

      "content": "Let's correct that and clarify the expression for Mark's initial weight.\n\nThe initial weight of Mark (before he lost weight during his illness) can be expressed based on the number of months he lost weight.\n\nGiven:\n- Final weight = 70 pounds\n- Mark loses 10 pounds each month\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach: Case 1: Direct Python Solution\n\nLet's express his initial weight as a function of the number of months (`months`) during which he lost weight:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify\n\n# Define the variable\nmonths = symbols('months')\n\n# Define the equation for initial weight\ninitial_weight = 70 + 10 * months\n\n# Simplify expression if needed (it's already simple)\ninitial_weight_simplified = simplify(initial_weight)\n\n# Output the simplified expression\nprint(f\"Initial Weight = {initial_weight_simplified}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- The weight loss computation correctly accounts for the constant weight loss rate of 10 pounds per month.\n- The final weight is increased by the total weight lost, calculated as `10 * months` to arrive at the initial weight before the illness.\n- The expression derived: \\(\\text{Initial Weight} = 70 + 10 \\times \\text{months}\\), correctly describes how the initial weight varies with the number of months `months` he lost weight.\n\nThus, Mark's initial weight, in terms of the number of months, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{70 + 10 \\times \\text{months}}\n\\]\n\nThis equation provides a formula for calculating his initial weight if the duration of weight loss (in months) is specified."

Letâ€™s formally express the equation that represents Mark's initial weight.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- Mark's final weight is 70 pounds.\n- He loses 10 pounds each month.\n\nTo find Mark's initial weight, we must account for the total weight he lost over the given months (`months`). The equation for his initial weight (`initial_weight`) based on his final weight and the number of months is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Weight} = 70 + 10 \\times \\text{months}\n\\]\n\nThus, Mark's initial weight is represented by:\n\n\\(\\boxed{10 \\times \\text{months} + 70}\\)\n\nThis equation states that you can determine his initial weight by adding back the total weight he lost over the months to his final weight."
