Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. Each bag of wheat weighs 60 pounds. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's use a direct Python solution to calculate the number of bags sold by the trader:\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Calculate the cost for the trader to buy and transport each bag.\n2. Determine the total income from selling the bags.\n3. Use the profit equation to find out how many bags were sold.\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost per bag**: \n    - Purchase cost per bag = $20 \n    - Transportation cost per bag = $2\n    - Total cost per bag = $22\n\n2. **Selling price per bag**:\n    - Selling price per bag = $30\n\n3. **Profit Equation**:\n    The profit equation is:\n\n    \\[\n    \\text{Profit} = (\\text{Selling price per bag} - \\text{Total cost per bag}) \\times \\text{Number of bags}\n    \\]\n\n    The problem states that the total profit is $400. Thus:\n\n    \\[\n    400 = (30 - 22) \\times \\text{Number of bags}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the number of bags**:\n    - Simplify the equation and solve for the number of bags.\n\nNow, let's implement the calculation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the cost and profit per bag\ncost_per_bag = 20 + 2  # Total cost per bag\nselling_price_per_bag = 30\n\n# Define the profit equation\nprofit_total = 400\nprofit_per_bag = selling_price_per_bag - cost_per_bag\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(profit_per_bag * x, profit_total)\n\n# Solve the equation\nbags_sold = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the results\nprint(bags_sold)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of bags sold, as required.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate the total cost per bag (\\$22) and verify it's correct.\n2. Calculate the profit per bag ($8) using the selling price and total cost.\n3. Set up and simplify the profit equation: \\(400 = 8 \\times \\text{Number of bags}\\).\n4. Solve to find Number of bags = 50.\n5. Check the calculations: \\(8 \\times 50 = 400\\), which matches the problem's profit statement.\n\nThe solution has been verified step-by-step.\n\nThus, the trader sold \\(\\boxed{50}\\) bags."
