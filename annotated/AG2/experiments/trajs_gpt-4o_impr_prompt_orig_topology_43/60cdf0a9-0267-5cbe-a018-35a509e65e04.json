Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many muffin crayons Kate can make and then determine the selling price of each muffin crayon if she made $36 in total. We can approach this problem with a straightforward calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Crayons**: \n    - Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, with each box containing 64 crayons.\n    - Total crayons = 3 boxes × 64 crayons/box.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Muffin Crayons**:\n    - Each muffin crayon is made from 8 small pieces of crayons.\n    - The total number of muffin crayons = Total crayons ÷ 8 crayons/muffin.\n\n3. **Determine the Selling Price of Each Muffin Crayon**:\n    - Total money made is $36.\n    - Selling price per muffin crayon = $36 ÷ Number of muffin crayons.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to find the exact selling price in fractional form if necessary.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total number of crayons\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# Calculate the number of muffin crayons Kate can make\nmuffins = total_crayons // 8\n\n# Calculate the selling price per muffin crayon\ntotal_money_made = 36\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(total_money_made, muffins)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\n\n### Let's Run and Evaluate:\n\n1. **Calculation of Total Crayons**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\) crayons.\n\n2. **Calculation of Muffin Crayons**:\n   - \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\) muffin crayons.\n\n3. **Price Per Muffin Crayon**:\n   - \\(\\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\\). However, we will present it as a fraction, which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nSo, each muffin crayon sells for \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) dollars or $1.50.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Recalculating the steps:\n  - Total crayons: \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\).\n  - Muffin crayons: \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\).\n  - Selling price per muffin: \\(\\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nAll steps are confirmed, and the calculation is verified. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}} \\]"

      "content": "It seems like we've already worked through the problem and arrived at the answer. Just to reiterate, here’s a concise breakdown of how we reached the solution:\n\n1. **Total Crayons**: Kate had 3 boxes with 64 crayons each.\n   - Total crayons = \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\).\n\n2. **Number of Muffin Crayons**: Each muffin is made from 8 crayons.\n   - Total muffin crayons = \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Selling Price per Muffin Crayon**: Kate made a total of $36 from selling all muffin crayons.\n   - Price per muffin = \\(\\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nThus, each muffin crayon sells for \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) dollars, which is equivalent to $1.50. The fractional result is preferred according to the problem instructions, so we present it as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\n\\]"
