Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSeth is twice as old as Brooke. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36. How old is Seth?"

Seth is twice as old as Brooke.\n2. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36.\n\nWe can express these statements as mathematical equations:\n\n1. \\( S = 2B \\)\n2. \\( (S + 3) + (B + 3) = 36 \\)\n\nNow, let's solve this system of equations step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n**Step 1**: Express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( B \\).\n\nUsing equation 1:  \n\\[ S = 2B \\]\n\n**Step 2**: Substitute \\( S \\) from Step 1 into equation 2.\n\nSubstitute \\( S = 2B \\) into equation 2:  \n\\[ (2B + 3) + (B + 3) = 36 \\]\n\n**Step 3**: Simplify and solve for \\( B \\).\n\n\\[ 2B + 3 + B + 3 = 36 \\]  \n\\[ 3B + 6 = 36 \\]  \n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:  \n\\[ 3B = 30 \\]\n\nDivide by 3:  \n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\n**Step 4**: Find Seth's age using \\( S = 2B \\).\n\nSince \\( S = 2B \\), we find:  \n\\[ S = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the steps and results:\n\n- Brooke's current age \\( B = 10 \\).\n- Seth's current age \\( S = 20 \\).\n\nCheck using the future sum of their ages:  \nIn 3 years, Brooke's age will be \\( 10 + 3 = 13 \\) and Seth's age will be \\( 20 + 3 = 23 \\).  \nThus, the sum in 3 years is \\( 13 + 23 = 36 \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\nSince the calculations and the verification step agree with the problem statement, we can be confident in the solution.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
