Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate Wilson's current math grade by finding the average of his five test scores. Let's follow the structured approach:\n\n### Key Idea\nWe're tasked with computing an average of the given test scores and checking if it meets a certain criterion (in this case, whether it's 85 or higher).\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the Test Scores**:\n   - Wilson received the following scores: 70, 95, 88, 90, and 78.\n\n2. **Calculate the Average**:\n   - The average is calculated by summing the test scores and dividing by the number of scores.\n\n3. **Determine if the Average Meets the Requirement**:\n   - We need to check if this average is at least 85.\n\nLet's compute the average using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import the required library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given test scores\ntest_scores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate the total sum of scores\nsum_scores = sum(test_scores)\n\n# Calculate the average using Rational for exact fraction\naverage_score = Rational(sum_scores, len(test_scores))\nprint(f\"The average score is {average_score}\")\n\n# Check if the average is at least 85\nmath_grade_requirement = 85\nprint(\"Meets requirement:\", average_score >= math_grade_requirement)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Calculate the sum of the scores:\n   - \\(70 + 95 + 88 + 90 + 78 = 421\\).\n\n2. Divide by the number of tests (5):\n   - \\(\\frac{421}{5} = 84.2\\).\n\n3. Compare with the requirement (85):\n   - \\(84.2\\) is less than \\(85\\).\n\nThe calculation and logic are correct.\n\nTherefore, Wilson's current math grade is \\(\\boxed{84.2}\\), and he does not meet the requirement."

Let's verify and finalize the solution based on this:\n\n### Average Calculation\n- The total sum of the scores is \\(421\\).\n- The average is computed as \\( \\frac{421}{5} \\), which evaluates to \\(84.2\\) in decimal form, but here it's represented as a fraction: \\( \\frac{421}{5} \\).\n\n### Check Against the Requirement\n- The average score \\( \\frac{421}{5} \\) is less than \\(85\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n- Wilson's average math grade, given as \\( \\frac{421}{5} \\), is indeed below the required 85.\n\nThe result is \\( \\boxed{84.2} \\) in decimal form or as a fraction, it is \\( \\boxed{\\frac{421}{5}} \\).
