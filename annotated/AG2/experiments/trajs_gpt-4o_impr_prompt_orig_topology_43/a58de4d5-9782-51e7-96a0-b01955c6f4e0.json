  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound.

      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend.

Then, we multiply by the number of jars sold to find the total profit.\n\nLet's calculate the cost for each ingredient:\n\n- **Passion fruit:** 2 pounds at $6 per pound costs:\n  \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) dollars\n\n- **Jackfruit:** 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound costs:\n  \\( 1.5 \\times 8 = 12 \\) dollars\n\n- **Honey:** 2 pounds at $10 per pound costs:\n  \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) dollars\n\nThe secret ingredient (water) doesn't cost anything.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for one jar:\n\nTotal cost for ingredients = \\( 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \\) dollars\n\nThe selling price per jar is $50.\n\nProfit per jar = Selling price - Cost of ingredients\n\\[ 50 - 44 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nIf Tim sells 10 jars, the total profit is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's write the calculations using a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Ingredient costs\npassion_fruit_cost = Rational(6)\njackfruit_cost = Rational(8)\nhoney_cost = Rational(10)\n\n# Weight in pounds\npassion_fruit_weight = Rational(2)\njackfruit_weight = Rational(3, 2)  # 1.5 pounds\nhoney_weight = Rational(2)\n\n# Calculating total cost of ingredients for one jar\ncost_per_jar = (\n    passion_fruit_weight * passion_fruit_cost +\n    jackfruit_weight * jackfruit_cost +\n    honey_weight * honey_cost\n)\n\n# Selling price and profit calculation\nselling_price_per_jar = Rational(50)\nprofit_per_jar = selling_price_per_jar - cost_per_jar\n\n# Total profit for 10 jars\ntotal_profit = 10 * profit_per_jar\n\n# Output the results\nprint(\"Total Profit for 10 jars:\", total_profit)\n```\n\nThe script calculates the costs using fractions to ensure precision and outputs the total profit.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Ingredient Costs:**\n   - Passion fruit: \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) dollars\n   - Jackfruit: \\(1.5 \\times 8 = 12\\) dollars\n   - Honey: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) dollars\n\n2. **Total Cost Calculation:**\n   - \\(12 + 12 + 20 = 44\\) dollars\n\n3. **Profit per Jar:**\n   - \\(50 - 44 = 6\\) dollars\n\n4. **Total Profit for 10 Jars:**\n   - \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\) dollars\n\nEach verification step confirms that the calculations and logic are correct, leading us to the final result: \\(\\boxed{60}\\) dollars."
