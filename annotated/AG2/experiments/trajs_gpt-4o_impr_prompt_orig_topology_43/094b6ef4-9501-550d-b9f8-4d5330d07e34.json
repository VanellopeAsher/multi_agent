Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. If the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length, how long is the shark?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given and solve for the shark's body length. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n**Key Idea**: We know the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. If we set the shark's length as \\( x \\), we can express and solve an equation in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**:\n1. Define the variable: Let \\( x \\) be the length of the shark in inches.\n2. The problem states that the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's length.\n3. Each remora is 6 inches long, so the total length of the remoras is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) inches.\n4. Set up the equation: \n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times x = 12\n   \\]\n   This equation represents that the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.\n\nLet's solve the equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem\nequation = Eq(0.10 * x, 12)\n\n# Solve the equation\nshark_length = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the solution in a fraction form (although here it will be integer)\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\nThe code above uses the `sympy` library to solve the equation, and we expect the output to be the shark's body length in inches.\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n\n1. We initially set up the equation \\( 0.10 \\times x = 12 \\).\n2. Solving for \\( x \\), we find \\( x = \\frac{12}{0.10} = 120 \\).\n3. Recalculating, we verify that 10% of 120 inches is indeed 12 inches (the combined length of the remoras).\n4. Thus, our solution checks out.\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
