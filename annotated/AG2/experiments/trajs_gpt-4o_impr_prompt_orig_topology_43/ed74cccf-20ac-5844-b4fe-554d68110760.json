Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps using the information provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the Sport Participation**:\n   - We know there are 6 students playing tennis.\n   - There are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis.\n\n2. **Calculate Volleyball Players**:\n   - If there are 6 students playing tennis, then twice that number are playing volleyball:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volleyball Players} = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Students Playing Soccer**:\n   - The problem states there are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. However, without the exact number of boys, we'll represent it using a variable (let's use \\( b \\)) for the number of boys.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Number of Students**:\n   - We sum up all the students from each sport to find the total:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = (\\text{Tennis Players}) + (\\text{Volleyball Players}) + (\\text{Soccer Players}) \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 6 + 12 + (b + 22)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 18 + b + 22\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 40 + b\n     \\]\n\nSince we do not know the exact number of boys playing soccer, the total number of students depends on \\( b \\).\n\n### Handling Missing Data\nAs we lack the precise number of boys playing soccer, this problem cannot yield a fixed numerical answer without this information. Hence, the result will rely on \\( b \\), the number of boys:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40 + b} \\]\n\n### Verification\n- Count for tennis: 6 students.\n- Count for volleyball: 12 students.\n- Count for soccer: \\( 22 + b \\) students.\n\nEach student only participates in one group. Adding the numbers results in the expression \\( 40 + b \\), confirming the derived calculation. \n\nThus, without the additional information about the number of boys, giving an exact number isn't possible."
