Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of the camera. Here's the structured approach:\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate Jayden's Total Money Before the Shortfall:**\n   - Jayden earned $70 from selling pictures.\n   - His sister Ava gave him half of her allowance, which is half of $90.\n   - Let's calculate the total amount Jayden has.\n\n2. **Calculate the Additional Amount Needed:**\n   - Jayden is $85 short of the price of the camera.\n   - We need to find out the total price of the camera when considering the amount he already has.\n\nLet's solve the problem with these steps using Python and the sympy library:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define symbols\nx = symbols('x')  # Representing the total price of the camera\n\n# Money Jayden initially has\nmoney_from_pictures = 70\nmoney_from_ava = 90 / 2  # Half of Ava's allowance\n\n# Total money Jayden currently has\ntotal_money_jayden_has = money_from_pictures + money_from_ava\n\n# Jayden needs $85 more, so:\n# Total price of the camera = total money Jayden has + 85\nequation = Eq(x, total_money_jayden_has + 85)\n\n# Solve for x\ncamera_price = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(camera_price)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the full price of the camera based on the provided figures.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate the money Jayden initially has:\n   - Money from pictures: $70\n   - Money from Ava: $45 (which is half of $90)\n   - Total money Jayden has: $70 + $45 = $115\n\n2. Jayden needs $85 more:\n   - Therefore, the price of the camera is $115 + $85.\n\nBy adding these amounts, we should get the total price of the camera. \n\nLet's box the final verified answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]"
