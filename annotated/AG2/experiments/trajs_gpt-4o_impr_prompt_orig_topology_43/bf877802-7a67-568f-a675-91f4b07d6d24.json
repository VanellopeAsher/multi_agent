Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we need to calculate the total angular displacement from the ground to the sun after the given time intervals. Let's break this into steps.\n\n1. **Initial Angle**: We know that the sun initially makes a 32-degree angle from the ground.\n\n2. **First Time Interval (10 hours at 5 degrees/hour)**:\n   - Add the angular displacement for the first 10 hours.\n   - Angular displacement in this phase = \\(10 \\text{ hours} \\times 5 \\text{ degrees/hour} = 50 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\n3. **Second Time Interval (2 hours at 3 degrees/hour)**:\n   - Add the angular displacement for the next 2 hours.\n   - Angular displacement in this phase = \\(2 \\text{ hours} \\times 3 \\text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate Total Angle**:\n   - Total degrees from the ground to the sun = Initial angle + Angular displacement from first interval + Angular displacement from second interval\n   - Total angle = \\(32 \\text{ degrees} + 50 \\text{ degrees} + 6 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\nLet's compute this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 2: Angular displacement during the first time interval\ndisplacement_first_interval = 10 * 5\n\n# Step 3: Angular displacement during the second time interval\ndisplacement_second_interval = 2 * 3\n\n# Step 4: Total angular displacement from the ground to the sun\ninitial_angle = 32\ntotal_angle = initial_angle + displacement_first_interval + displacement_second_interval\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_angle)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of degrees from the ground to the sun.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify each step:\n- The initial angle from the ground is 32 degrees.\n- In 10 hours at 5 degrees per hour, the sun moves \\(50\\) degrees.\n- In the next 2 hours at 3 degrees per hour, it moves an additional \\(6\\) degrees.\n- Thus, the total angle = \\(32 + 50 + 6\\).\n\nFinal computation:\n- Total angle = 32 + 50 + 6 = 88 degrees.\n\nAs each step is verified, we are confident in presenting the final result.\n\n\\(\\boxed{88}\\)"
