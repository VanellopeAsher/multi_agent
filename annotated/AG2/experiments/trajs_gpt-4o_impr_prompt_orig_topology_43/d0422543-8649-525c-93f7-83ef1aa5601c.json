Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in years?"

We are told that this is 8 years less than twice the age of his son. We need to find the son's age.\n\nLet's denote the son's age by \\( x \\). According to the problem, Carver's age can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 60 = 2x - 8 \\]\n\nWe need to solve this equation for \\( x \\) to find the son's age. I will use Python, specifically the sympy library, to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for son's age\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(2*x - 8, 60)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsons_age = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Display the result\nprint(sons_age[0])\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the son's age and print it. Let's check it:\n\n1. Define the equation based on the given relationship.\n2. Solve for the unknown variable, which is the son's age (\\( x \\)).\n3. Use sympy to solve it symbolically and find the exact solution."

Let's verify this solution step-by-step:\n\nGiven:\n\n- Carver's age: 60 years\n- Relationship: \\( 60 = 2x - 8 \\)\n\nSolve the equation for the son's age:\n\n1. Start with the equation:\n   \\[ 60 = 2x - 8 \\]\n\n2. Add 8 to both sides:\n   \\[ 60 + 8 = 2x \\]\n   \\[ 68 = 2x \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[ x = \\frac{68}{2} \\]\n   \\[ x = 34 \\]\n\nTherefore, the son's age is 34 years.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n- Twice the son's age: \\( 2 \\times 34 = 68 \\)\n- 8 years less than twice the son's age: \\( 68 - 8 = 60 \\)\n\nThis confirms that our solution is correct, as it satisfies the relationship described in the problem.
