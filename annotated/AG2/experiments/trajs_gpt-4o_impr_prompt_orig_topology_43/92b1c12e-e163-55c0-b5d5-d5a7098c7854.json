Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

According to the problem, he is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. Therefore, we have:\n     \\[\n     2d - 5 = 45\n     \\]\n   - Carver's daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son:\n     \\[\n     d = 3s + 4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equations:**\n   - First, solve for \\( d \\) from the first equation:\n     \\[\n     2d - 5 = 45 \\implies 2d = 50 \\implies d = 25\n     \\]\n   - Next, substitute \\( d = 25 \\) into the second equation to find \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     25 = 3s + 4\n     \\]\n\nNow, we can implement this in Python using the sympy library to solve for \\( s \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for daughter's age (d) and son's age (s)\nd, s = symbols('d s')\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\nequation1 = Eq(2*d - 5, 45)  # Carver's age equation\nequation2 = Eq(d, 3*s + 4)   # Daughter's age equation\n\n# Solve for d from the first equation\nsolution_d = solve(equation1, d)\n# Substitute this value of d in the second equation and solve for s\nsolution_s = solve(equation2.subs(d, solution_d[0]), s)\n\n# Output the son's age\nprint(f\"The son's age is: {solution_s[0]}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n- Solve the first equation: \\( 2d - 5 = 45 \\) gives \\( d = 25 \\).\n- Substitute \\( d = 25 \\) into \\( 25 = 3s + 4 \\) to find:\n  \\[\n  25 = 3s + 4 \\implies 3s = 21 \\implies s = 7\n  \\]\n\nThe son's age is verified as \\( \\boxed{7} \\)."
