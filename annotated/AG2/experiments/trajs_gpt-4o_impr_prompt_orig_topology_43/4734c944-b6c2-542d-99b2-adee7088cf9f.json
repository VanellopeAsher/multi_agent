Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of action figures Peter can purchase over one week, with a budget of $70. He will purchase wooden figures from Sunday to Wednesday and plastic figures for the rest of the week. Here's a structured approach to solve this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Weekly Budget Division:**\n   - Peter wants to spend an equal amount of his $70 over each day of the week. Calculate the daily spending amount.\n\n2. **Determine Action Figures Purchased:**\n   - From Sunday to Wednesday (4 days), calculate how many wooden action figures can be purchased each day with the daily budget.\n   - From Thursday to Saturday (3 days), calculate how many plastic action figures can be purchased each day with the daily budget.\n\n3. **Total Action Figures:**\n   - Add up the total number of wooden and plastic action figures to get the total number of action figures by the end of the week.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using step-by-step calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total amount Peter has\ntotal_amount = 70\n\n# Number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Calculate daily spending\ndaily_spending = Rational(total_amount, days_in_week)\n\n# Cost of wooden and plastic action figures\nwooden_cost = 5\nplastic_cost = 2.5\n\n# From Sunday to Wednesday (4 days), Peter buys wooden action figures\nwooden_days = 4\nwooden_figures_per_day = daily_spending // wooden_cost\ntotal_wooden_figures = wooden_figures_per_day * wooden_days\n\n# From Thursday to Saturday (3 days), Peter buys plastic action figures\nplastic_days = 3\nplastic_figures_per_day = daily_spending // plastic_cost\ntotal_plastic_figures = plastic_figures_per_day * plastic_days\n\n# Total number of action figures\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Total action figures Peter will have:\", total_action_figures)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Daily Spending Calculation:**\n   - Peter spends $70 in 7 days, so his daily spending is $\\frac{70}{7} = 10$. This matches our calculation using `Rational`.\n\n2. **Wooden Action Figures:**\n   - Each wooden figure costs $5, so with a $10 daily budget, Peter can buy $10 รท 5 = 2$ wooden action figures per day from Sunday to Wednesday (4 days total).\n\n3. **Plastic Action Figures:**\n   - Each plastic figure costs $2.5, so with a $10 daily budget, Peter can buy $10 รท 2.5 = 4$ plastic action figures per day from Thursday to Saturday (3 days total).\n\n4. **Total Calculation:**\n   - Total wooden figures: $2 \\times 4 = 8$\n   - Total plastic figures: $4 \\times 3 = 12$\n   - Total action figures: $8 + 12 = 20$\n\nNow, presenting the final result: \n\n\\( \\boxed{20} \\) \n\nPeter will have a total of 20 action figures by the end of the week."
