Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it. They are red, white, purple, and yellow.   Half the mural is yellow. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, calculate how many pints of red paint was used."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The mural consists of four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.\n- Half the mural is yellow.\n- The other half is equally divided between red, white, and purple.\n- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.\n\n**Objective:**\n- Determine how many pints of red paint were used.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. Calculate the amount of yellow paint:\n   - Since half of the mural is yellow, and the whole mural uses 12 pints of paint, the yellow portion is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) pints.\n\n2. Determine the remaining paint:\n   - The remaining paint, therefore, is \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\) pints, which is shared equally among red, white, and purple.\n\n3. Calculate the amount of red paint:\n   - Since red, white, and purple paint are equal in quantity, divide the remaining 6 pints among these three colors: \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints for each color.\n\nThus, 2 pints of red paint are used in the mural.\n\nLet's summarize the solution:\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation using Python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\ntotal_paint = 12  # in pints\nyellow_paint = Rational(1, 2) * total_paint  # Half of the mural is yellow\n\n# The remaining paint is for red, white, and purple equally\nremaining_paint = total_paint - yellow_paint\nred_paint = Rational(1, 3) * remaining_paint\n\nfrom sympy import pprint\npprint(red_paint, use_unicode=True)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- Total paint used: 12 pints\n- Yellow: 6 pints (half of the mural)\n- Red, White, Purple equally: 6 pints total, divided into 3 colors giving 2 pints each.\n\nI feel confident with this breakdown and calculations, so we can box the final answer:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]\n\nThis is the amount of red paint used (in pints)."
