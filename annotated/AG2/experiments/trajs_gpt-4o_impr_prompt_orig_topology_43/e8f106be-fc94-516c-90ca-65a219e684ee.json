You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4.

      "content": "To solve the problem of calculating the amount of crepe paper James needs for his fence, we will consider the perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence. Here's a structured approach to solve this problem:\n\n### Key Idea\nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers around his backyard fence. To determine how much he needs, we must calculate the perimeter of the rectangular area where the streamers will be hung. The tree in the middle does not affect the fence nor alters its perimeter since streamers won't be hung across the tree.\n\n### Problem Context and Calculation\n- The dimensions of the rectangular fence are given:\n  - Length: 20 feet\n  - Width: 15 feet\n- Since we're calculating the perimeter of a rectangle, the formula is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n  \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter**:\n   - Use the given dimensions to find the perimeter:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (20 + 15)\n     \\]\n\nLet's perform the calculation using Python as per our guidelines.\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the perimeter of the fence\nlength = 20  # length of the fence in feet\nwidth = 15   # width of the fence in feet\n\n# Calculate the perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Printing the perimeter, as the amount of crepe paper needed\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Calculation Check**: \n   - Sum of length and width = 20 + 15 = 35 feet.\n   - Multiply by 2 to get the perimeter = 2 * 35 = 70 feet.\n2. **Logical Check**: \n   - Given there is no streamer across the tree and only around the fence, the calculation of perimeter directly gives the length needed for crepe paper.\n\nThe calculated amount of crepe-paper needed is indeed correct, so we can confidently assert our solution.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]\n\nJames will need to buy 70 feet of crepe-paper streamers for his birthday party."
