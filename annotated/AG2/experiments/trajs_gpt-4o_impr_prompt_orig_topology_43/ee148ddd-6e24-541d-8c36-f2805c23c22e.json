Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "To address this problem, we will follow a step-by-step process to calculate the total time John spent on his activities, then determine how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate the time spent on activities:**\n   - Boating: 6 hours.\n   - Swimming: Half the time of boating, so \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours.\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows × 2 hours each = 6 hours.\n\n2. **Total time spent on these activities:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total activity time} = 6 \\, \\text{(boating)} + 3 \\, \\text{(swimming)} + 6 \\, \\text{(shows)} = 15 \\, \\text{hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Establish how the given total activity time relates to the presented percentages:**\n   \n   The 15 hours account for 30% of the total time John spent on activities.\n\n4. **Calculate the overall total time spent:**\n   \\[\n   x \\times 0.30 = 15\n   \\]\n   Solving this gives:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{15}{0.30} \\quad \\implies \\quad x = 50 \\, \\text{hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the time spent sightseeing:**  \n   Sightseeing constitutes 40% of John's total activity time. Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sightseeing time} = 50 \\times 0.40 = 20 \\, \\text{hours}\n   \\]\n\nLet’s implement this in Python using the SymPy library to perform exact calculations using fractions:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total known time spent on activities in hours\nboating_time = 6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 3 * 2   # 3 shows, 2 hours each\n\n# Total time spent on the activities\ntotal_activity_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time\n\n# Represent percentages as fractions for precision\nthirty_percent = Rational(30, 100)\nforty_percent = Rational(40, 100)\n\n# Total time calculation from 30% of the activities\ntotal_time = Rational(total_activity_time) / thirty_percent\n\n# Time spent sightseeing (40% of total time)\nsightseeing_time = total_time * forty_percent\n\n# Print the result in exact form using fractions\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n- **Total time spent on activities:** 15 hours results in 30% of the total activity time.\n- **Calculation of total activity time (x = 50):** Verifying \\( \\frac{50}{100} \\times 30 = 15 \\) returns accurate results.\n- **Sightseeing time (20 hours):** Verifying \\( \\frac{50}{100} \\times 40 = 20 \\).\n\nResult:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]\nThis gives us the total time John spent sightseeing."

Just to reiterate, based on the scenario provided:\n\nJohn engaged in various activities, and the total time for those accounted for 30% of the time he spent during his vacation.
