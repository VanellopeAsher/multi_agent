      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV throughout the week.\n\nLet's break down the TV watching schedule:\n\n- **Monday and Tuesday**: Each day, Frankie watches a 1-hour episode. \n  - Total time for Monday and Tuesday = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\n- **Wednesday**: Frankie watched three 30-minute episodes.\n  - Total time for Wednesday = 3 × 30 minutes = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours.\n\n- **Thursday**: Frankie watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.\n  - Total time for Thursday = 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours.\n\n- **Friday**: Frankie watched two one-hour episodes.\n  - Total time for Friday = 2 × 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total hours watched from Monday through Friday:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total hours} = 2 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 \\]\n\nCalculating the result:\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculations\nmonday_tuesday = 2 # in hours (1 hour each day)\nwednesday = Rational(90, 60) # in hours (three 30-minute episodes)\nthursday = 1 + Rational(30, 60) # in hours (1.5 hours total)\nfriday = 2 # in hours (two 1-hour episodes)\n\n# Total hours of TV watched\ntotal_hours = monday_tuesday + wednesday + thursday + friday\n\n# Output result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of hours Frankie watched TV.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the calculations step by step:\n\n- **Monday and Tuesday**: 2 hours\n- **Wednesday**: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours\n- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours\n- **Friday**: 2 hours\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[ 2 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nThe calculations have been verified to be correct, and therefore the total hours Frankie watched TV is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."
