Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn is a carpenter. For his friend Ali, he manufactured 40 wooden tables for $200 each and 20 roof frames for $100 each. How much does Ali have to pay John?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John for the wooden tables and roof frames. We'll break down the problem step-by-step and then provide the Python code to compute the final result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost for Wooden Tables:**\n   - John manufactured 40 wooden tables.\n   - Each table costs $200.\n   - Total cost for tables = Number of tables × Cost per table.\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost for Roof Frames:**\n   - John manufactured 20 roof frames.\n   - Each roof frame costs $100.\n   - Total cost for roof frames = Number of roof frames × Cost per roof frame.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - Add the total cost for tables and the total cost for roof frames to get the final amount Ali has to pay.\n\n### Python Implementation\nWe'll use Python to perform these calculations. The sympy package is not needed here, as basic arithmetic suffices.\n\n```python\n# Number of tables and cost per table\ntables_count = 40\ncost_per_table = 200\n\n# Number of roof frames and cost per roof frame\nframes_count = 20\ncost_per_frame = 100\n\n# Calculate total costs\ntotal_cost_tables = tables_count * cost_per_table\ntotal_cost_frames = frames_count * cost_per_frame\n\n# Calculate the total amount Ali has to pay\ntotal_amount = total_cost_tables + total_cost_frames\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_amount)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Calculation for Tables:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for tables} = 40 \\times 200 = 8000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculation for Roof Frames:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for frames} = 20 \\times 100 = 2000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Amount to Pay:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount} = 8000 + 2000 = 10000\n   \\]\n\nBy verifying each calculation step by step, we confirm the total amount Ali must pay is \\(\\boxed{10000}\\)."
