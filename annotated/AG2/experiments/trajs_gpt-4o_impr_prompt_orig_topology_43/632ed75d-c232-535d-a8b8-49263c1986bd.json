Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we need to determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France. We can approach this with a step-by-step process:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Understand the Total Flights:**\n   - We know that the second aircraft flies exclusively to Poland, with 44 flights representing half of the total flights made by the first aircraft.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Flights of the First Aircraft:**\n   - If 44 flights are half of the first aircraft's total flights, then the total number of flights for the first aircraft is:\n   \n3. **Determine Flights Distribution for the First Aircraft:**\n   - The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights.\n   - The remaining flights are evenly divided between France and Germany.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Let x be the total number of flights by the first aircraft\nx = symbols('x', positive=True, integer=True)\n\n# Given that 44 is half of the total flights of the first aircraft\nequation = x / 2 - 44\n\n# Solving for x\ntotal_flights_first_aircraft = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculating flights to Greece, France and Germany\nflights_to_greece = (3/4) * total_flights_first_aircraft\nremaining_flights = total_flights_first_aircraft - flights_to_greece\n\n# Since the remaining flights are evenly divided, flights to France will be half of remaining flights\nflights_to_france = remaining_flights / 2\n\n# Output the number of flights to France\nprint(flights_to_france)\n```\n\n### Explain the Solution:\n- We begin by solving for the total flights made by the first aircraft using the information that the number of flights to Poland is half of the flights made by the first aircraft.\n- Once we have the total number of flights, we determine how many flights are directed to Greece.\n- Finally, the remaining flights after those to Greece are split evenly between France and Germany. So, we take half of the remaining flights as those going to France.\n\nThis code will compute the required number of flights by the first aircraft to France. Let's run the code to get the final result."

Hence, flights to France: \\(\\frac{22}{2} = 11\\).\n\nThe calculation steps are consistent and correct, confirming the number of flights to France is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
