      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \n48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. However, before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break down the process step by step.\n\nInitially, we have 48 passengers on the bus.\n\n### First Stop:\n1. **8 passengers** get off the bus. \n   - Passengers remaining: \\(48 - 8 = 40\\).\n2. **5 times as many passengers** get on the bus as the number who got off.\n   - People getting on: \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\).\n   - New total of passengers: \\(40 + 40 = 80\\).\n3. **2 passengers**, who just got on, decide to get off again.\n   - Passengers remaining after 2 people get off: \\(80 - 2 = 78\\).\n\n### Second Stop:\n1. **21 passengers** get off the bus.\n   - Passengers remaining: \\(78 - 21 = 57\\).\n2. **3 times fewer passengers** get on the bus compared to those getting off at this stop.\n   - People getting on: \\( \\frac{21}{3} = 7\\).\n   - New total of passengers: \\(57 + 7 = 64\\).\n\nThus, after the second stop, there are **64 passengers** riding the bus. Now let me verify the solution.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n- Initial Passengers: 48\n- First Stop:\n  - Off: 8,  On: \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\), Off again: 2\n  - Calculation: \\(48 - 8 + 40 - 2 = 78\\)\n- Second Stop:\n  - Off: 21, On: \\(\\frac{21}{3} = 7\\)\n  - Calculation: \\(78 - 21 + 7 = 64\\)\n\nBoth the calculation and results align with the problem description.\n\nFinal answer: \\(\\boxed{64}\\)"
