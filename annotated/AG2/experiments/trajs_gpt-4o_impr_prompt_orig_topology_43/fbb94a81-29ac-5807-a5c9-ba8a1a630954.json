Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 18 years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age."

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean using variables. Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Let \\( P \\) be the age of Peter.\n2. Let \\( A \\) be the age of Paul.\n3. Let \\( J \\) be the age of Jean.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:\n  \\[\n  P + A + J = 100\n  \\]\n\n- Paul is 18 years older than Jean:\n  \\[\n  A = J + 18\n  \\]\n\n- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages:\n  \\[\n  P = A + J\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this system of equations to find the age of Peter (\\( P \\)).\n\nLet's substitute \\( A = J + 18 \\) into the other equations:\n\nSubstitute into the equation for Peter's age:\n\\[\nP = (J + 18) + J = 2J + 18\n\\]\n\nNow substitute both \\( A = J + 18 \\) and \\( P = 2J + 18 \\) into the equation for the total age:\n\\[\n(2J + 18) + (J + 18) + J = 100\n\\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( J \\):\n\\[\n2J + 18 + J + 18 + J = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n4J + 36 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n4J = 64\n\\]\n\\[\nJ = 16\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\( J = 16 \\), we can find Paul's age:\n\\[\nA = J + 18 = 16 + 18 = 34\n\\]\n\nFinally, calculate Peter's age:\n\\[\nP = 2J + 18 = 2(16) + 18 = 32 + 18 = 50\n\\]\n\nHence, the age of Peter is 50 years. \n\nLet's verify each step and confirm our calculations.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Jean's age (\\( J \\)) is 16.\n2. Paul's age (\\( A \\)) is \\( 16 + 18 = 34 \\).\n3. Peter's age (\\( P \\)) is \\( 2 \\times 16 + 18 = 32 + 18 = 50 \\).\n4. Sum of ages: \\( 50 + 34 + 16 = 100 \\), which matches the condition given.\n\nThus, our solution checks out.\n\n\\(\\boxed{50}\\)"
