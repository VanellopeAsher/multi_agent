Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of messages James delivers by summing the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.\n\n**Key Concept:**\nJames delivers a specific number of messages to Ms. Thompson and a fraction of that number to Mr. Yu.\n\n**Problem-Solving Approach:**\n- We know James delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson.\n- He delivers \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.\n- Therefore, the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 84\\).\n\nLet's solve this problem by computing these values.\n\n```python\n# Importing the sympy library to handle fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_to_thompson = 84\n\n# Number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu\nmessages_to_yu = Rational(1, 3) * messages_to_thompson\n\n# Total number of messages delivered\ntotal_messages = messages_to_thompson + messages_to_yu\n\n# Output the total number of messages using the print function\nprint(total_messages)\n```\n\nNow let's execute this code to find the total number of messages delivered by James.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Verify each step:**\n   - Compute messages to Mr. Yu: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 84 = \\frac{84}{3} = 28\\).\n   - Total messages: \\(84 + 28 = 112\\).\n\n2. **Ensure no errors exist in calculations** by crossing-checking each computation step, as shown.\n\n3. The result has been checked and rechecked for accuracy.\n\n James delivers a total of \\(\\boxed{112}\\) messages."
