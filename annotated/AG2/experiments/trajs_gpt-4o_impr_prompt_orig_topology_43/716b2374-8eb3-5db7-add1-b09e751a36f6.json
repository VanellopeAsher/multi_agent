  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each pack of cloths based on Kim's expenses, income, and profit.\n\n**Key Information:**\n- Kim has a total of \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) clients.\n- Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach.\n- Each bottle of bleach costs $2.\n- Bleach expenses per client = \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) dollars.\n- Total bleach expenses = \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) dollars.\n- Kim's total weekly income is $92.\n- Kim's profit is $20.\n\n**Profit Formula:**\nProfit = Total Income - Total Expenses\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\nProfit = Total Income - (Bleach Expenses + Cloth Expenses)\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\\[\n20 = 92 - (32 + \\text{Cloth Expenses})\n\\]\n\nCalculating the Cloth Expenses:\n\\[\n32 + \\text{Cloth Expenses} = 92 - 20\n\\]\n\\[\n32 + \\text{Cloth Expenses} = 72\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cloth Expenses} = 72 - 32 = 40\n\\]\n\nSince each pack of cloths is used per client, and there are 8 clients:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per pack of cloths} = \\frac{\\text{Cloth Expenses}}{8} = \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n- Total expenses = Bleach expenses + Cloth expenses = 32 + 40 = 72.\n- Profit is calculated as Income - Expenses = 92 - 72 = 20, which matches the given profit.\n\nThus, the cost of each pack of cloths is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
