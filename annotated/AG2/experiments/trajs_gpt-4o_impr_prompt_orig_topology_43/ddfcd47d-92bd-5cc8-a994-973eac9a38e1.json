Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $150, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we start by determining how much money each person initially has and then calculate how much each would have if they combined their money and shared it equally.\n\n### Key Concept and Solution Approach\n\nThe problem involves determining the initial amounts of money each person has based on given relationships and then performing an arithmetic average to find the equal share for each.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate Kassidy's Money:**\n   - We know that Aurelia has $150.\n   - Kassidy has \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of Aurelia's money.\n   - Kassidy's money = \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 150\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Rayna's Money:**\n   - Rayna has $70 more than Kassidy.\n   - Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $70.\n\n3. **Total Money and Equal Share:**\n   - Add the money of Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna to get the total.\n   - Divide the total by 3 for an equal share.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python with sympy for any necessary rational operations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate Kassidy's money\naurelia_money = 150\nkassidy_money = Rational(2, 3) * aurelia_money\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Rayna's money\nrayna_money = kassidy_money + 70\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total money and the equal share\ntotal_money = aurelia_money + kassidy_money + rayna_money\nequal_share = total_money / 3\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Aurelia's Money: ${aurelia_money}\")\nprint(f\"Kassidy's Money: ${kassidy_money}\")\nprint(f\"Rayna's Money: ${rayna_money}\")\nprint(f\"Equal share for each: ${equal_share}\")\n```\n\n### Execution\n\nLet's execute the calculations to determine the amounts.\n\n1. Kassidy's Money:\n   - Kassidy has \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = 100\\).\n\n2. Rayna's Money:\n   - Rayna has \\(100 + 70 = 170\\).\n\n3. Total Money:\n   - Total = \\(150 + 100 + 170 = 420\\).\n\n4. Equal Share:\n   - Equal share = \\( \\frac{420}{3} = 140\\).\n\n### Result\nEach would have $140 if they combined and shared equally.\n\n\\(\\boxed{140}\\)\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Calculation for each individual's initial amount:\n   - Kassidy: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = 100\\).\n   - Rayna: \\(100 + 70 = 170\\).\n\n2. Verify total money and equal share:\n   - Total: \\(150 + 100 + 170 = 420\\).\n   - Equal share: \\( \\frac{420}{3} = 140\\).\n\nThe calculations confirm the accuracy of the result. The final answer is \\( \\boxed{140} \\)."
