Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.

      "content": "To solve the problem of calculating Scarlett's total expenditure for her aquarium setup, we will follow a straightforward approach and use Python for the arithmetic calculations.\n\n### Key Idea\nThis problem can be solved with a direct computation in Python by summing up the costs of all items Scarlett purchased.\n\n### Solution\n\nScarlett's purchases include:\n- One aquarium for $10.00\n- Two bags of rocks, each costing $2.50\n- Three pieces of coral, each costing $2.00\n- Fish food costing $2.00\n\nWe need to compute the total expenditure by adding the cost of each item.\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\n# Cost of the aquarium\naquarium_cost = 10.00\n\n# Cost of 2 bags of rocks\nrocks_cost = 2 * 2.50\n\n# Cost of 3 pieces of coral\ncoral_cost = 3 * 2.00\n\n# Cost of fish food\nfish_food_cost = 2.00\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = aquarium_cost + rocks_cost + coral_cost + fish_food_cost\n\n# Print total cost\nprint(f'Total amount spent by Scarlett: ${total_cost}')\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify each cost component and ensure the total sum matches our expectation:\n\n1. **Aquarium**: $10.00\n2. **Rocks**: \\(2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\\)\n3. **Coral**: \\(3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00\\)\n4. **Fish food**: $2.00\n\n**Total calculation:**\n\\[ 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = 23.00 \\]\n\nThe total calculated cost is consistent with our expectations.\n\nTherefore, using the final result format, we have:\n\\[\n\\boxed{23.00}\n\\]"
