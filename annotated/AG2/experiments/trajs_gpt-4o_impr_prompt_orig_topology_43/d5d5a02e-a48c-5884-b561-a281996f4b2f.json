Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother using the information provided about their future ages. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( E \\) be Emil's current age, which is \\( 21 \\).\n   - Let \\( D \\) be his dad's current age.\n   - Let \\( B \\) be his brother's current age.\n\n2. **Formulate the Equations Using Future Predictions:**\n   - In 5 years, Emil will be 26.\n   - We are told that when Emil is 26:\n     - He will be half the age of his dad: \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \\).\n     - He will be twice the age of his brother: \\( 26 = 2(B + 5) \\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Equations:**\n   - From Emil being half the age of his dad in 5 years:\n     \\[\n     D + 5 = 52 \\implies D = 47\n     \\]\n   - From Emil being twice the age of his brother in 5 years:\n     \\[\n     2(B + 5) = 26 \\implies B + 5 = 13 \\implies B = 8\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum of Current Ages:**\n   - The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is:\n     \\[\n     D + B = 47 + 8 = 55\n     \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- **Verification of Dad's Age:**\n  - In 5 years, Dad's age will be \\( 47 + 5 = 52 \\).\n  - Emil is supposed to be half the age of his dad when he is 26:\n    - \\( 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\) matches the calculated future age of the dad.\n\n- **Verification of Brother's Age:**\n  - In 5 years, Brother's age will be \\( 8 + 5 = 13 \\).\n  - Emil is supposed to be twice the age of his brother when Emil is 26:\n    - \\( 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\) matches Emil's age of 26.\n\nWe have verified that both conditions set for Emil's future age relationships hold true with our calculated current ages.\n\nThus, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is \\(\\boxed{55}\\)."
