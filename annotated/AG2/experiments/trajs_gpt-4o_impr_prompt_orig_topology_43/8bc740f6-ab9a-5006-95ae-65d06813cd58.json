Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.

We have the following information:\n   - The first website publishes an average of 20 articles per day.\n   - The second website publishes an average of 10 articles per day.\n   - February has \\( 2.8 \\times 10 = 28 \\) days (2.8 times ten days).\n\n2. Calculate the total number of articles published by each website in February.\n   - First website: \\( 20 \\times 28 \\)\n   - Second website: \\( 10 \\times 28 \\)\n\n3. Sum the results from both websites to get the total number of articles published.\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for potential symbolic calculations, although not necessary in this case\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols\n\n# Define the number of days in February\ndays_in_february = 28  # Given as 2.8 times of ten days\n\n# Number of articles published per day by each website\narticles_website1_per_day = 20\narticles_website2_per_day = 10\n\n# Calculate total articles for each website\ntotal_articles_website1 = articles_website1_per_day * days_in_february\ntotal_articles_website2 = articles_website2_per_day * days_in_february\n\n# Calculate the total number of articles by both websites\ntotal_articles = total_articles_website1 + total_articles_website2\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(total_articles)\n```\n\nLet's run the code to compute the total number of articles."

Let's verify the calculations to ensure everything is accurate.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Days in February**: Given as \\(2.8\\) times of ten days, which results in \\(28\\) days. This seems correct since February usually has 28 days.\n\n2. **Articles from the first website**: \n   - Articles per day: 20\n   - Total for February: \\(20 \\times 28 = 560\\)\n\n3. **Articles from the second website**:\n   - Articles per day: 10\n   - Total for February: \\(10 \\times 28 = 280\\)\n\n4. **Total articles from both websites**:\n   - Sum of both: \\(560 + 280 = 840\\)\n\nAfter verifying each step, the computed total number of articles for February is correct.
