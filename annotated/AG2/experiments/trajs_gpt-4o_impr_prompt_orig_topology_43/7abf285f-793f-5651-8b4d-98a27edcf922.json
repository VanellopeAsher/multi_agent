Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Jessica pays on her debts in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on each of her debts. We'll account for the gym but note that her Netflix fee is offset by a coupon, effectively making it $0.\n\n### Key Idea\nJessica pays 50% more than the minimum payment on her debts of student loans, credit cards, and mortgage. We need to calculate her new monthly payment, and then determine the total annual payment.\n\n### Monthly Payment Calculation\n1. **Student Loans:**\n   - Minimum monthly payment: $300\n   - Payment with 50% more: $300 + 0.5 × $300 = $450\n\n2. **Credit Card:**\n   - Minimum monthly payment: $200\n   - Payment with 50% more: $200 + 0.5 × $200 = $300\n\n3. **Mortgage:**\n   - Minimum monthly payment: $500\n   - Payment with 50% more: $500 + 0.5 × $500 = $750\n\nJessica will pay these new amounts monthly. We sum them up for a single month and then multiply by 12 to find the annual total.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. Calculate the monthly payment for each debt.\n2. Sum the monthly payments.\n3. Multiply by 12 to get the annual payment.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Monthly minimum payments\nstudent_loan_min = 300\ncredit_card_min = 200\nmortgage_min = 500\n\n# Calculate payments with 50% increase\nstudent_loan_payment = student_loan_min * Rational(3, 2)\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min * Rational(3, 2)\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min * Rational(3, 2)\n\n# Total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Annual payment\nannual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result\nprint(annual_payment)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the total amount Jessica pays in a year for her debts.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. Verify that each debt payment calculation incorporates a 50% increase.\n2. Confirm that the total monthly payment is calculated accurately.\n3. Ensure that the annual conversion is correct (multiplying the monthly total by 12).\n\nNow, let's compute using the script provided, which evaluates to:\n\n```python\n450 + 300 + 750 = 1500  # Monthly total\n1500 * 12 = 18000       # Annual total\n```\n\nThe amount Jessica pays on her debts in a year is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{18000}\n\\]"

However, this was not intended to be part of the executable code, but rather, as part of the explanation in the VERIFICATION section.\n\nLet me clarify without confusing with erroneous syntax:\n\nWhen we perform the calculation in Python, we will simply print the result without attempting to assign a calculated value to an expression. Here’s how we should correctly use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Monthly minimum payments\nstudent_loan_min = 300\ncredit_card_min = 200\nmortgage_min = 500\n\n# Calculate payments with 50% increase\nstudent_loan_payment = student_loan_min * Rational(3, 2)\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min * Rational(3, 2)\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min * Rational(3, 2)\n\n# Total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Annual payment\nannual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result\nprint(annual_payment)\n```\n\nBy using SymPy’s `Rational`, the computation remains symbolic, allowing us to easily verify the arithmetic:\n\n1. **Student Loans:** \\( 300 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 450 \\)\n2. **Credit Card:** \\( 200 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 300 \\)\n3. **Mortgage:** \\( 500 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 750 \\)\n4. **Total Monthly Payment:** \\( 450 + 300 + 750 = 1500 \\)\n5. **Annual Payment:** \\( 1500 \\times 12 = 18000 \\)\n\nThus, the amount Jessica pays annually on her debts is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{18000}\n\\]"
