Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 50 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we want to find the length of each final piece of ribbon Marty ends up with. Let's break down the problem using a step-by-step method (Case 3):\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Determine the length of each part after the initial division:**\n   - Marty cuts 10,000 millimeters of ribbon into 40 equal parts.\n   - Each part will thus be: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Length of each part} = \\frac{10000}{40} \\, \\text{mm}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Further divide each of those parts:**\n   - Each of the 40 parts is then divided into 50 equal smaller parts.\n   - Length of each final small part will be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length of each final small part} = \\frac{\\text{Length of each part}}{50} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{10000}{40}\\right)}{50} \\, \\text{mm}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compute the length of each final small part:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total length of the ribbon\ntotal_length_mm = 10000\n\n# Number of initial parts\ninitial_parts = 40\n\n# Number of smaller parts to divide each part into\nsmaller_parts = 50\n\n# Calculate the length of each part after the initial cut\neach_part_length = Rational(total_length_mm, initial_parts)\n\n# Calculate the length of each final small part\nfinal_small_part_length = each_part_length / smaller_parts\n\n# Print the result\nprint(final_small_part_length)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- **Step 1: Verify the division of the initial part:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{10000}{40} = 250 \\, \\text{mm}\n  \\]\n- **Step 2: Verify the division into smaller parts:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\, \\text{mm}\n  \\]\n\nAfter verifying these steps, we find each final small ribbon piece is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) mm long."
