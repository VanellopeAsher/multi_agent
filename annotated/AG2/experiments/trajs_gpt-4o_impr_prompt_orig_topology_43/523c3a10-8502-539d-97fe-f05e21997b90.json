      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery packet of graham crackers can be used to create the base for 8 big smores. A box contains 3 such packets. If there are 9 children each desiring 2 smores and 6 adults each wanting 1 smore, how many boxes of graham crackers would be necessary?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow the steps outlined. This is a simple algebraic word problem regarding the formation of s'mores using packets and boxes of graham crackers.\n\nKey Idea:\n- Calculate the total number of s'mores needed for the children and adults.\n- Determine how many s'mores can be made from one box of graham crackers.\n- Calculate how many boxes are needed based on the total requirement.\n\nStep-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate Total S'mores Needed:**\n   - Each child wants 2 s'mores, and there are 9 children.\n   - Each adult wants 1 s'more, and there are 6 adults.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total s'mores} = (9 \\times 2) + (6 \\times 1) \\]\n\n2. **Calculate S'mores Per Box:**\n   - Each packet can create 8 big s'mores.\n   - One box contains 3 packets.\n\n\\[ \\text{S'mores per box} = 3 \\times 8 \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Number of Boxes Required:**\n   - Use ceiling division because we can't have a fraction of a box.\n\n\\[ \\text{Boxes needed} = \\lceil \\frac{\\text{Total s'mores}}{\\text{S'mores per box}} \\rceil \\]\n\nLet's compute using Python, employing the `math` package for the ceiling function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Total s'mores needed\ntotal_s'mores = (9 * 2) + (6 * 1)\n\n# S'mores per box\ns'mores_per_box = 3 * 8\n\n# Boxes needed\nboxes_needed = math.ceil(total_s'mores / s'mores_per_box)\n\nprint(boxes_needed)\n```\n\nWith this code, we can compute the required number of boxes.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- First, confirm the total s'mores needed: \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\) from children and \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\) from adults. Therefore, the total is \\(18 + 6 = 24\\).\n- Confirm s'mores per box: Each packet can make 8 s'mores, and a box has 3 packets, so \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\).\n- Determine boxes needed: \\( \\lceil \\frac{24}{24} \\rceil = 1\\).\n\nEverything checks out, so only 1 box of graham crackers is needed.\n\n\\(\\boxed{1}\\)"
