Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to break it down step-by-step and use algebra to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationships among the articles written.**\n\n- On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.\n- On Tuesday, she wrote \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) times more articles than on Monday. This means if she wrote \\( x \\) articles on Tuesday, then \\( x = 5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5 = \\frac{7}{5} \\times 5 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.**\n\nLet's solve this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Fraction\n\n# Calculating articles written on Tuesday\narticles_monday = 5\nincrease_factor = Fraction(2, 5)\narticles_tuesday = articles_monday + increase_factor * articles_monday\nprint(\"Articles on Tuesday:\", articles_tuesday)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Set up the equation for Wednesday.**\n\nLet \\( y \\) be the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, the total time for all articles is given by:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 + \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\times 5 \\right) \\times 4 + y \\times 4 = 104 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( y \\).**\n\nLet's use Python again to set up and solve this equation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Defining total hours spent\ntotal_hours = 104\n\ny = symbols('y', real=True)\nequation = 5 * 4 + articles_tuesday * 4 + y * 4 - total_hours\narticles_wednesday = solve(equation, y)[0]\n\nprint(\"Articles on Wednesday:\", articles_wednesday)\n```\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the ratio of articles on Wednesday to Tuesday.**\n\nFinally, we calculate how many times as many articles were written on Wednesday as on Tuesday.\n\n```python\nratio = articles_wednesday / articles_tuesday\nprint(\"Ratio of articles on Wednesday to Tuesday:\", ratio)\n```\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. Verify the calculated values for articles written each day.\n2. Cross-check the total number of hours to ensure it sums to 104.\n3. Check the ratio calculated matches the question's expectation.\n\nNow let's perform these calculations using the code provided:\n\n### Executing the Python Code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Fraction, symbols, solve\n\n# Calculating articles written on Tuesday\narticles_monday = 5\nincrease_factor = Fraction(2, 5)\narticles_tuesday = articles_monday + increase_factor * articles_monday\n\n# Defining total hours spent\ntotal_hours = 104\n\ny = symbols('y', real=True)\nequation = 5 * 4 + articles_tuesday * 4 + y * 4 - total_hours\narticles_wednesday = solve(equation, y)[0]\n\nratio = articles_wednesday / articles_tuesday\n\nprint(\"Articles on Tuesday:\", articles_tuesday)\nprint(\"Articles on Wednesday:\", articles_wednesday)\nprint(\"Ratio of articles on Wednesday to Tuesday:\", ratio)\n```\n\nThe result from the code will provide us with the final boxed answer for the ratio of articles written on Wednesday to Tuesday."
