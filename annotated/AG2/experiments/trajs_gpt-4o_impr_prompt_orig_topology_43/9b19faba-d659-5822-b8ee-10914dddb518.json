Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a step-by-step approach to calculate the total earnings from selling gingerbread and apple pies over the specified days.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( G_s \\) be the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday.\n   - Let \\( A_s \\) be the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday.\n   - Suppose Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday. Therefore, \\( G_s = 10 \\).\n   - On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pies than on Sunday. Let's denote Sundayâ€™s apple pie sales as \\( A_{\\text{sun}} \\) and \\( A_s = A_{\\text{sun}} - 4 \\).\n   - On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more gingerbreads than he did on Saturday, thus \\( G_{\\text{sun}} = G_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \\).\n   - Additionally, on Sunday, he sold 15 apple pie boxes, hence \\( A_{\\text{sun}} = 15 \\).\n\n2. **Sales Calculation:**\n   - On Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie.\n   - Cost per gingerbread box: $6\n   - Cost per apple pie box: $15\n\n3. **Earnings Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the total earnings for each day:\n     - **Saturday**:\n       - Gingerbread: \\( G_s \\times 6 = 10 \\times 6 \\)\n       - Apple pie: \\( A_s \\times 15 = (A_{\\text{sun}} - 4) \\times 15 = (15 - 4) \\times 15 \\)\n     - **Sunday**:\n       - Gingerbread: \\( G_{\\text{sun}} \\times 6 = 15 \\times 6 \\)\n       - Apple pie: \\( A_{\\text{sun}} \\times 15 = 15 \\times 15 \\)\n     - **Monday**:\n       - Gingerbread: \\( 2 \\times 6 \\)\n       - Apple pie: \\( 4 \\times 15 \\)\n\n4. **Total Earnings:**\n   - Sum the earnings for three days.\n\nWe'll now perform these calculations in Python using the sympy library to maintain symbolic computation, even though it's not strictly necessary here.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, expand\n\n# Define the costs\ncost_gingerbread = 6\ncost_apple_pie = 15\n\n# Saturday sales\nG_saturday = 10\nA_saturday = 15 - 4\n\n# Sunday sales\nG_sunday = G_saturday + 5\nA_sunday = 15\n\n# Monday sales\nG_monday = 2\nA_monday = 4\n\n# Calculate earnings for each day\nearnings_saturday = G_saturday * cost_gingerbread + A_saturday * cost_apple_pie\nearnings_sunday = G_sunday * cost_gingerbread + A_sunday * cost_apple_pie\nearnings_monday = G_monday * cost_gingerbread + A_monday * cost_apple_pie\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = expand(earnings_saturday + earnings_sunday + earnings_monday)\n\n# Print the total earnings\nprint(\"Total earnings for three days: $\", total_earnings)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Saturday Calculation:**\n   - Gingerbread: \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\)\n   - Apple pie: \\(11 \\times 15 = 165\\)\n   - Total Saturday: \\(60 + 165 = 225\\)\n\n2. **Sunday Calculation:**\n   - Gingerbread: \\(15 \\times 6 = 90\\)\n   - Apple pie: \\(15 \\times 15 = 225\\)\n   - Total Sunday: \\(90 + 225 = 315\\)\n\n3. **Monday Calculation:**\n   - Gingerbread: \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\)\n   - Apple pie: \\(4 \\times 15 = 60\\)\n   - Total Monday: \\(12 + 60 = 72\\)\n\n4. **Total Earnings:**\n   - Total: \\(225 + 315 + 72 = 612\\)\n\nTherefore, the total amount Sunny earned in three days is \\(\\boxed{612}\\)."
