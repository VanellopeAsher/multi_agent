Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "To determine the number of packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought, we need to solve a system of equations based on the information provided.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\n\n**Key Idea**: Set up equations based on the total cost and the cost per packet for both types of seeds. Solve for the unknown, which is the number of tomato seed packets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. Let's denote:\n   - \\( x \\) as the number of tomato seed packets.\n   - We know there are 80 packets of celery seeds.\n\n2. Mrs. Rylan spent a total of $3200 on seeds.\n   \n3. The cost of one packet of tomato seeds is $40, and the cost of one packet of celery seeds is $30.\n\n4. Create an equation based on the total cost:\n   \\[\n   40x + 30 \\times 80 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n5. Solve the equation for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's solve this using Python and the `sympy` library to keep it symbolic and use exact forms:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the unknown\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(40*x + 30*80, 3200)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- We first import necessary functions from `sympy`.\n- Define the variable `x` to represent the number of tomato seed packets.\n- Set up the equation based on the total cost of seeds.\n- Solve the equation for `x`.\n- Print the solution, which will be the number of packets of tomato seeds.\n\nLet's now verify and calculate.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of celery seeds: \\( 30 \\times 80 = 2400 \\).\n2. Subtract this from the total amount spent: \\( 3200 - 2400 = 800 \\).\n3. Since each packet of tomato seeds costs $40, calculate \\( x = \\frac{800}{40} \\).\n\nThese verification steps ensure that our solution is consistent with the problem constraints.\n\nFinally, based on this, the number of packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"
