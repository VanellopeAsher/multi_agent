Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each. William bought five notebooks and a ballpen. He also decided to buy a pencil case that costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens. How much did he spend in all?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total spending based on the price of individual items and the quantity purchased. I'll guide you through the calculation using Python with the `sympy` library to ensure we can handle any fractional calculations.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nWe will break down the total cost into parts: \n1. The cost of notebooks and ballpen.\n2. The cost of the pencil case, which depends on the cost of notebooks and ballpens.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Calculate the cost of notebooks and ballpens directly.\n2. Determine the cost of a pencil case based on the given condition.\n3. Add these costs to find the total expenditure.\n\nLet's translate this into Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define price of each item\nprice_of_notebook = Rational(150, 100)  # $1.50\nprice_of_ballpen = Rational(50, 100)    # $0.50\n\n# Calculate the cost of notebooks and ballpen\nnumber_of_notebooks = 5\ncost_of_notebooks = number_of_notebooks * price_of_notebook\n\nnumber_of_ballpens = 1\ncost_of_ballpen = number_of_ballpens * price_of_ballpen\n\n# Total initial cost for notebooks and ballpen\ninitial_cost = cost_of_notebooks + cost_of_ballpen\n\n# Calculate the cost of a pencil case\n# A pencil case costs twice as much as one notebook and two ballpens\ncost_of_one_notebook_and_two_ballpens = (\n    price_of_notebook + 2 * price_of_ballpen\n)\ncost_of_pencil_case = 2 * cost_of_one_notebook_and_two_ballpens\n\n# Total cost = initial cost + cost of pencil case\ntotal_cost = initial_cost + cost_of_pencil_case\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Total cost:\", total_cost)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Cost of Notebooks:**\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 1.5 = 7.5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of Ballpen:**\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 0.5 = 0.5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Initial Cost:**\n   \\[\n   7.5 + 0.5 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost of Pencil Case Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{One notebook and two ballpens cost: } 1.5 + 2 \\times 0.5 = 2.5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pencil case cost: } 2 \\times 2.5 = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total Cost:**\n   \\[\n   8 + 5 = 13 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount William spent:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]"
