You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it. They are red, white, purple, and yellow.   Half the mural is yellow.

Assuming a uniform spread, that would mean that each of these colors occupies 1/6th, or roughly 16.67%, of the mural.\n\nTo calculate how much red paint was used, we can simply take 1/6th of the total amount of paint used. Let's write a Python program for it:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ntotal_paint = 12  # total amount of paint used in pints\n# Red, white and purple each occupy 1/6 of the mural\nfraction_red = sp.Rational(1, 6)\n\nred_paint = fraction_red*total_paint\n\nprint(red_paint)\n```"
