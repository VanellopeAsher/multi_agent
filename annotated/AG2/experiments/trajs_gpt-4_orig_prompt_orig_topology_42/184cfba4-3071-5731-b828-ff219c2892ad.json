You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

      "content": "Ok, let's solve it using Python.\nSince we know that each small stuffed animals costs $40, and large ones cost three times that, we can say a large stuffed animal costs $120. Each sale was either a small stuffed animal or a large one. If Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can say for every 3 animals sold, 2 were small and 1 was large.\n\nThe total earning of $1200 should be the sum of the cost of the small and large animals sold. We would set up an equation for this and solve.\n\nLet's denote the number of large toys sold as x. Then the number of small toys sold would be 2x. Therefore, the total gain of $1200 equals to the sum of the cost for the small and large toys sold: 40*2x (price of small toys sold) + 120*x (price of large toys sold) = 1200. We can solve this equation to find the number of large toys sold (x), and then we can find the number of small toys sold (2x). \n\nLet's follow the steps above and implement it in Python.\n\n```python\n# python code\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# set up the equation\nequation = Eq(40*2*x + 120*x, 1200)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolutions = solve(equation, x)\n\n# the first solution is the number of large toys, and the second one is the number of small toys\nprint(\"The number of large toys sold is:\", solutions[0])\nprint(\"The number of small toys sold is:\", 2*solutions[0])\n```"
