You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

      "content": "Key Idea: The total number of letters Elise has written will be the sum of the number of letters she wrote in full three times, half of the number of letters once, and the total of those all over again.\n\nSteps:\nFirstly, we find out the number of letters Elise wrote when she wrote the alphabet in full three times. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, Elise has written `26 * 3` letters.\nSecondly, Elise writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is `26 / 2`.\nLastly, Elise rewrites everything she has already written, which means we need to add the total of the first two steps.\nNow, we can calculate the total number of letters Elise has written using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of letters in alphabet\nletters_in_alphabet = 26\n\n# Times Elise writes alphabet in full\nfull_times = 3\n\n# Times Elise writes half of alphabet\nhalf_times = 1\n\n# Calculate total letters before rewrite\nbefore_rewrite = (letters_in_alphabet * full_times) + (letters_in_alphabet * half_times / 2)\n\n# Calculate total letters after rewrite\nafter_rewrite = before_rewrite * 2\n\n# Print result\nprint(after_rewrite)\n``` \n\nThe final step is to evaluate the Python code."
