You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows.

Let's implement this idea in Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total numbers of presents\ntotal_presents = 6 + 4 + 2 \n\n# total length of the ribbon\ntotal_ribbon_length = 144 \n\n# Calculate the length of ribbon that can be allocated for each present\nribbon_per_present = total_ribbon_length / total_presents\n\nprint(ribbon_per_present)\n```\nThis Python code will return the length of the ribbon that Monica can allocate for each present's bow."
