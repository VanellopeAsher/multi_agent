You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips.

Then, divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips he can fit in a row to find out the number of rows of each color. Finally, add up the number of rows of each color to get the total number of rows Jackson will plant.\n\nThe key idea here is to calculate the number of tulips in total, then calculate the number of rows. This is a straightforward calculation problem and we can solve it with Python code directly.\n\nLet's denote the number of red tulips as `r`, the number of blue tulips as `b`, and the number of rows as `rows`.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# define the number of tulips in one row\nred_row = 6 \nblue_row = 8\n\n# calculate the number of red and blue tulips Jackson buys\nr = 3.6 * 10\nb = 2.4 * 10\n\n# calculate the number of red and blue rows\nred_rows = r // red_row\nblue_rows = b // blue_row\n\n# calculate the total number of rows\nrows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\nprint(rows)\n```"
