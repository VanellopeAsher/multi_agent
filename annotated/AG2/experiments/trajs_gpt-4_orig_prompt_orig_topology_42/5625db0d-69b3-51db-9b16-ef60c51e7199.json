  "problem": "On Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each. At the checkout, she got $3 off because she had voucher. The next day, the price increased to $25 per fruit, but the store also offered a 15% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 15 apples.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.

      "content": "The key point to solving this problem is to calculate the total prices paid on each day and subtract one from the other.\n\nThe calculation can be done directly with Python.\n\n1. On Tuesday, the price for each apple was $15, therefore, the cost before discount for 15 apples would be 15 * 15. Since she had a $3 voucher, the final total would be 15*15 - 3.\n2. On Wednesday, the price of each apple was $25, therefore, the total cost before the 15% discount would be 15 * 25. A 15% discount implies that she only pays 85% of the total cost, hence the final price would be 0.85 * 15 * 25.\n3. To calculate the difference between the two final prices, we can simply subtract the final price of the first day from the second day. \n\nNow, we can streamline these calculation steps into Python code:\n\n```python\n# calculation\nprice_first_day = 15 * 15 - 3\nprice_second_day = 0.85 * 15 * 25\ndifference = price_second_day - price_first_day\n\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nThis Python code calculates the difference between the final costs on Tuesday and Wednesday."
