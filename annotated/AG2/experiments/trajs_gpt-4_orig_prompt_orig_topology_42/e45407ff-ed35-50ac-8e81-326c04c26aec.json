You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

      "content": "First, let's calculate the cost for the scotch bottles which John bought. We know that he bought 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Hence, we can deduce that one bottle of scotch costs $60.\n\nHe also buys twice as many bottles of cognac. Thus, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n\nGiven the price per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the scotch. This means that one bottle of cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90.\n\nHence, the cost of the cognac bottles will be 20 * 90 = $1800.\n\nFor the total cost spent on alcohol, we just add the cost of the scotch bottles to the cost of the cognac bottles. \n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\n# number of scotch bottles\nnum_scotch = 10\n\n# cost of one scotch bottle\ncost_scotch = 600 / num_scotch\n\n# number of cognac bottles\nnum_cognac = 2 * num_scotch\n\n# cost of one cognac bottle\ncost_cognac = 1.5 * cost_scotch\n\n# total cost of all cognac bottles\ntotal_cost_cognac = num_cognac * cost_cognac\n\n# total cost spend on alcohol\ntotal_cost = 600 + total_cost_cognac\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```"
