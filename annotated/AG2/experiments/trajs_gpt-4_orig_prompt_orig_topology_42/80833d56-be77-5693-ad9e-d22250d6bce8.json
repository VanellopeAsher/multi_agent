You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 100 miles a week.

We know he runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.\n\nStep 2: Divide the total distance (100 miles) by the total hours to get the speed.\n\nLet's write a program to solve the problem. We will use Python's basic arithmetic operations for this.\n\n```python\n# total hours for the first day \nfirst_day_hours = 10 \n\n# total hours for the other two days \nother_days_hours = 0.5 * first_day_hours * 2 \n\n# total hours in a week \ntotal_hours = first_day_hours + other_days_hours \n\n# total distance in miles \ntotal_distance = 100 \n\n# calculate speed \nspeed = total_distance / total_hours \n\nprint(speed)\n```"
