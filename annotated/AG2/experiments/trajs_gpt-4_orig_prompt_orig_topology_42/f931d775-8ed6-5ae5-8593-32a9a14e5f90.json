  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

The number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene is half the total number of lines of the scene, which is twice the song or 108 lines, but only a third of them are his, so 1/3*108. In the second scene, the total number of lines is six more than the song, or 60 lines, and four-fifths of them are his, so 4/5*60. Adding the 15 lines from the absent actor, we get the total number of lines Sean has to memorize. Let's calculate it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of lines in the song\nsong_lines = 54 \n\n# number of lines in the first scene\nfirst_scene_total = song_lines * 2 \n\n# Sean's lines in the first scene\nfirst_scene_lines = first_scene_total / 3\n\n# number of lines in the second scene\nsecond_scene_total = song_lines + 6\n\n# Sean's lines in the second scene\nsecond_scene_lines = second_scene_total * 4 / 5\n\n# additional lines from absent actor\nabsent_actor_lines = 15\n\n# total lines for Sean to memorize\ntotal_lines = song_lines + first_scene_lines + second_scene_lines + absent_actor_lines\n\nprint(total_lines)\n```"
