You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11.

Once we have that, we can easily calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are:\n1. Assign a common variable to their ages: 7x for Darrell's age and 11x for Allen's age.\n2. Write an equation using the sum of their ages.\n3. Solve for x.\n4. Calculate Allen's current age and then his age 10 years from now.\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate the desired values:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# equation for the sum of their ages\neq = Eq((7 * x) + (11 * x), 162)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolutions = solve(eq, x)\n\n# calculate Allen's current age\nallen_current_age = 11 * solutions[0]\n# calculate Allen's age 10 years from now\nallen_future_age = allen_current_age + 10\nprint(allen_future_age)\n```"
