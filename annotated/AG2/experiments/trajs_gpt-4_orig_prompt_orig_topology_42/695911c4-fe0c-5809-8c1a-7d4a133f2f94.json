You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years, after the cost increase.\n\nWe can calculate these using simple arithmetic operations in Python."

Pauline visits the museum three times a year, and each visit costs $10, so the total cost for 10 years will be `10*3*10 = $300`.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost increase. An increase of 150% means the cost becomes `150% + 100% = 250% = 2.5` times of the original price. So the new cost per visit after 10 years will be `10*2.5 = $25`.\n\nFor the next 3 years, the total cost will be `3*3*25 = $225`.\n\nFinally, we sum up the costs for these 13 years.\n\nLet's write this in python:\n\n```python\n# cost for the first 10 years\ncost_10_years = 10*3*10\n# new cost per visit\nnew_cost_per_visit = 10*2.5\n# cost for the next 3 years\ncost_3_years = 3*3*new_cost_per_visit\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_10_years + cost_3_years\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```"
