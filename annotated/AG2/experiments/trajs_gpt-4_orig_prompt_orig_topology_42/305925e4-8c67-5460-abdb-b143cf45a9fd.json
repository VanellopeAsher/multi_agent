You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJoey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble.

      "content": "The problem can be solved directly by using simple arithmetic operations. We'll assume \"points\" Joey scores as p. The difference in points after Joey and Marcy's turn would be `(214 + p) - (225 + 10)`. \n\nLet's write this in a Python program. We'll assume Joey scores 30 points on his turn. If you tell me the actual points Joey scored, I can update the program:\n```python\n# points scored by Joey\np = 30\n\n# points before the turn\nJoey_before = 214\nMarcy_before = 225\n\n# points after the turn\nJoey_after = Joey_before + p\nMarcy_after = Marcy_before + 10\n\n# the difference in points\ndifference = Joey_after - Marcy_after\n\nprint(difference)\n```\nThis solution will print how many points more Joey has than Marcy after both of their turns."
