You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters.

      "content": "Key idea: To find the total age of all these siblings, we firstly need to find the age of the older brother. Once we have that, we can sum up the ages of all the kids in the family.\n\nFirstly, we know that the younger brother is 12 years old and he is said to be half the age of his older brother. This therefore implies that the older brother has an age of 2 times the younger brother.\nSecondly, sum up the ages of the sisters. Since all the sisters are 16 years old, the total of their ages would be 16 times the number of sisters.\nLastly, sum up the total age of the brothers and that of the sisters to get the total age of all the siblings. Let's calculate:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# first find the age of older brother\nyounger_brother_age = 12\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# find total age of sisters\nnumber_of_sisters = 10\nsister_age = 16\ntotal_sister_age = number_of_sisters * sister_age\n\n# finally find total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = younger_brother_age + older_brother_age + total_sister_age\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\nFollow these steps and adjust it according to the result of each query."
