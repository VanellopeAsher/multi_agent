You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours.

The total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days can be calculated by following these steps:\n\n1. On Tuesday, Bruce worked for 5 hours.\n2. On Wednesday, he worked double that duration, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.\n3. On Thursday, he worked 2 hours less than Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.\n\nTo achieve the total work hours, these individual days work hours need to be added up.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial work hours\ntuesday_hours = 5\n\n# Double the tuesday_hours for Wednesday\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\n\n# On Thursday, 2 hours less than wednesday_hours\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# Total work hours\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\nprint(\"Total work hours over these three days are: \", total_hours)\n```\nThis program will output the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days."
