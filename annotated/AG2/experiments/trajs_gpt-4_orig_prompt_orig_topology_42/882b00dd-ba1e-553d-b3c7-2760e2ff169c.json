On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.

Calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours.\n    * Billy had a starting rate of $10, a raise of $0.50 after 2 months and another raise of $1 after a year. Since the problem does not specify the exact time frame after which we are comparing Billy's and Sally's earnings, let's assume it is after one year when Billy's hourly rate reaches $11.50 (10 + 0.5 + 1).\n2. Calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours.\n    * Sally starts with $10.50 per hour (0.5 more than Billy's starting salary) and has a raise of $0.50 after 2 months. So, if we also consider the period to be one year, her total rate will be $11.00 (10.5 + 0.5).\n3. Calculate the difference between Billy's and Sally's total earnings.\n\nLet's write Python code for the calculations: \n\n\\begin{verbatim}\n# your code\n\\end{verbatim}"
