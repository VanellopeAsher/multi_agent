You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80.

      "content": "Key Idea: The total cost of the classes is fixed at $80. Manny's parents measure the cost per class by dividing the total cost by the number of classes they paid for. If Manny misses a class, it effectively increases the cost per class because the total cost doesn't change, but the number of class they got for their money decreases. We just simply calculate the number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $20.\n\nWe can solve this problem with Python code directly. We can set up a loop that subtracts one from the total number of classes until the cost per class exceeds $20. Then we will know the maximum number of classes Manny can miss.\n\nLet's code now.\n\n```python\ntotal_cost = 80\ntotal_classes = 12\ncost_per_class = total_cost / total_classes\n\nwhile cost_per_class <= 20:\n    total_classes -= 1\n    cost_per_class = total_cost / total_classes\n\nmax_missed_classes = 12 - total_classes - 1\nprint(max_missed_classes)\n```\nThe minus 1 at the end is because the while loop will reduce total_classes one extra time as it tries to check the condition after reaching the threshold. Therefore, we add 1 to correct the count."
