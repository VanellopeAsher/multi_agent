Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

To solve this scenario, we don't need any package but the Python built-in functions.\n\n```python\n# number of cards made by Erica\ncards_made = 20\n\n# number of cards brought by her dad\ncards_from_dad = 2 * 30 # assuming there are 30 cards in a box as mentioned in the problem\n\n# total number of cards before given out\ntotal_cards = cards_made + cards_from_dad \n\n# number of cards given out\ncards_given_out = 24 + 5\n\n# number of cards received from others \ncards_received = 17\n\n# final number of cards she has now\nfinal_cards = total_cards - cards_given_out + cards_received \n\nprint(final_cards)\n```"
