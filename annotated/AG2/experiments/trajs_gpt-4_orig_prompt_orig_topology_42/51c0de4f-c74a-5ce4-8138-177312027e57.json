  "problem": "Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money. If Walter's lawyer contributed $6600 in total, how much did his friend give him?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "Key Idea: Walter's total collected amount comes from three sources - his neighbors, the online fund, and his lawyer. The lawyer's contribution is three times the amount donated by everybody else. We also have information on the total amount donated by the lawyer. By subtracting the sum of the donations made by the neighbors and the online fund from the total money collected, we can find how much Walter's friend has donated.\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total amount donated by Walter's neighbors and the online fund.\nStep 2: Find out how much everyone else donated apart from the lawyer.\n       - Since the lawyer donated three times as much as everyone else, we can divide the lawyer's total donation by 3.\nStep 3: Subtract the total donation of neighbors and the online fund from the donation made by everyone else (excluding the lawyer). \n       - This will give us the amount donated by Walter's friend. \n\nLet's implement this. \n\n```python\n# Step 1\nneighbors_donation = 500  # in dollars\nonline_fund_donation = 1500  # in dollars\n\n# Step 2\nlawyer_donation = 6600  # in dollars\n\neveryone_else_donation = lawyer_donation / 3\n\n# Step 3\nfriend_donation = everyone_else_donation - (neighbors_donation + online_fund_donation)\nprint(friend_donation)\n```\n\nYou can run this Python script to calculate how much Walter's friend gave him."
