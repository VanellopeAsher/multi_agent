You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

      "content": "Key Idea: Let's denote the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday as x. And since the number of chimichangas made on Wednesday is the same, it is also x. The number of chimichangas made on Friday is twice that of Tuesday, so it is 2x. Therefore, the sum of all these, which is 500, gives us the equation 2x + 2x = 500.\n\nCase 1: The problem can be solved with Python code directly. We can construct an equation from the problem statement and solve for x, which is the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n\nLet's write the Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(2*x + 2*x, 500)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation)\n\nprint('The number of chimichangas made on Tuesday is:', solution[0])\n```"
