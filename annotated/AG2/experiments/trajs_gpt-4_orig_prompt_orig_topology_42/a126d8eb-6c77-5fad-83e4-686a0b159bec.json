You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJake is shopping at a clothing store.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys one and gets another one at 50% off. Therefore, the cost for 2 T-shirts becomes $80 + 0.5*$80 = $120. Since Jake buys 20 T-shirts, he buys 10 pairs, so the total cost for the T-shirts is 10*$120. \n\n2. For the shoes, they are 40% off the original price. Therefore, the cost for the shoes becomes $400 - 0.4*$400 = $240.\n\nTo get the total cost, we just need to add the two together. Let's calculate them in Python."
