You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

We also know that after the third week, the beanstalk is 10 inches. Thus, to find out how much the beanstalk grew in the third week, we can subtract the height of the beanstalk after the second week from the height of the beanstalk after the third week.\n\n```python\n# height of beanstalk after the first week\nheight_week_1 = 3\n\n# height of beanstalk after the second week\nheight_week_2 = 2 * height_week_1\n\n# height of beanstalk after the third week\nheight_week_3 = 10\n\n# growth in the third week\ngrowth_week_3 = height_week_3 - height_week_2\n\nprint('The beanstalk grew {} inches in the third week.'.format(growth_week_3))\n```"
