You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries.

      "content": "Key idea: To solve this problem, we first determine the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 1000 from the number of cherries Robert has. Then, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries. Finally, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has to get the difference.\n\nLet's write a program to solve the problem.\n\nCase 1:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# The number of cherries Robert has\nrobert_cherries = 3000\n# The number of cherries Richard has\nrichard_cherries = robert_cherries - 1000\n# The total number of cherries\ntotal_cherries = 6000\n# The number of cherries Jerry has\njerry_cherries = total_cherries - robert_cherries - richard_cherries\n# The number of cherries Robert has more than Jerry\ndiff = robert_cherries - jerry_cherries\n\nprint(diff)\n```\nYou can run the code above to get the answer."
