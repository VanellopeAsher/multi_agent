You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "Here is the key idea to solve this problem:\n\nFirstly, we know that the great pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. Then, the sun starts to move straight upwards from the tip of the pyramids, moving at 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours. This would add 5 * 10 = 50 degrees to the initial angle of the pyramids, giving us 82 degrees. \n\nAfterwards, the sun starts to move at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours. This would add 3 * 2 = 6 degrees to the current angle of the sun relative to the ground. \n\nBy adding all the degrees together, we can find the final degrees from the ground to the sun after the sun has moved for the stated periods of time.\n\nLet's streamline the calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\n# initialize the initial degree of the great pyramids\ninitial_degree = 32 \n\n# calculate the degree after the sun moves 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours\ndegree_after_10_hours = initial_degree + 5 * 10 \n\n# calculate the final degree after the sun moves 3 degrees per hour for 2 more hours\nfinal_degree = degree_after_10_hours + 3 * 2\n\n# print the final degree from the ground to the sun\nprint(final_degree)\n```\n\nYou can run the Python code to get the final result."
