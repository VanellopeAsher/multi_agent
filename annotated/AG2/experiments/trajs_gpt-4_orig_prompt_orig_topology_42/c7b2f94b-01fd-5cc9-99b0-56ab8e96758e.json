  "problem": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

So using this information, we can find out how many apples Joanne's sister gathered:\n500 (combined total) - 395 (Joanne's total) = 105 apples.\n\nWe also know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.\n\nSubtracting this from the total apples gathered by her sister (105 apples), we can find out how many apples she gathered from the shortest trees:\n105 (total gathered by sister) - 60 (from tallest trees) = 45 apples.\n\nTo find out how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees, we can divide this (45 apples) by the amount Joanne gathered from the shortest trees (15 apples):\ntimes = 45 (gathered by sister) / 15 (gathered by Joanne).\n\nLet's calculate the above steps with Python."
