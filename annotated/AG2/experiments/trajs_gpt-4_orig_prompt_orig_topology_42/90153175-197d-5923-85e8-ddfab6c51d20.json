You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.

      "content": "Key Idea: To solve the question, we need to follow the steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in a day. She makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast, so she eats 3 eggs in a day.\n2. Calculate the total number of days in 12 weeks. Each week has 7 days, so 12 weeks is 12*7 days.\n3. Multiply the total number of eggs she eats in a day by the total number of days in 12 weeks to get the total number of eggs she eats.\n4. Since a dozen contains 12 eggs, divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens of eggs.\n\nLet's implement the steps as mentioned using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Total number of eggs Claire eats in a day\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# Total number of days in 12 weeks\ndays = 12*7\n\n# Total number of eggs she eats\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_day * days\n\n# Number of dozens of eggs\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / 12\n\nprint(dozens_of_eggs)\n```"
