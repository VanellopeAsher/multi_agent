You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

We're given information about a variety of activities John did and how these activities correspond to certain percentages of his total vacation time.\n\nThe key idea to solve the problem is to start by calculating the total time John spent on vacation. That's because we know the time he spent sightseeing is 40% of his total time. \n\nNow take a look at the problem:\n\nJohn spent 6.6 hours boating, half of that time swimming, and he watched three 2.5-hour shows. That's a total of 6.6 + 6.6 / 2 + 3 * 2.5 hours. We know that this is 30% of his total time.\n\nTo calculate the total time, we set up the equation:\n\ntotal_time = (6.6 + 6.6 / 2 + 3 * 2.5) / 0.3\n\nNow we can calculate the time John spent sightseeing. This is 40% of his total time, so:\n\ntime_sightseeing = total_time * 0.4 \n\nNow we can solve these equations using Python."
