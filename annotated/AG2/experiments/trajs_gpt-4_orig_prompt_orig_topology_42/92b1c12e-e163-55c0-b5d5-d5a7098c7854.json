You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "We can solve this problem by using some Python code to solve a few simple equations. The equations are based on the given problem, as follows:\n1. The first sentence tells us that the age of Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his daughter i.e., 2*DaughterAge -5 =CarverAge or 2*DaughterAge =CarverAge +5\n2. The second sentence tells us that the daughter is 4 years older than three times the son's age i.e., 3*SonAge +4= DaughterAge or 3*SonAge = DaughterAge-4\n\nWe also know the age of Carver is 45, so we can substitute this into the equation and solve for the son's age. Let's write the solution in Python."
