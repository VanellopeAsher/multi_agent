  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThe main idea here is to calculate the total time he spent and then use the proportion given to calculate the sightseeing time.\n\nThe problem can be solved through Python code directly.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate John's total activity time in hours. Given that he spends 6 hours boating, 3 hours swimming (half of boating time), and 6 hours watching shows (3 shows * 2 hours each), we'll add up all these times to find the total. \n2. We'll then use the fact that this total time is just 30% of the entire time he spent. So to find the full time, we'll divide the total by 0.3.\n3. Once we have the full time, finding how much he spent sightseeing is easy. We just take 40% of this full time.\n4. We'll print the sightseeing time.\n\nPython Code:\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\nboating_hours = 6\nswimming_hours = boating_hours / 2\nwatching_show_hours = 2 * 3\n\ntotal_activity_hours = boating_hours + swimming_hours + watching_show_hours\n\nfull_time = total_activity_hours / 0.3\nsightseeing_hours = full_time * 0.4\nprint(sightseeing_hours)\n```"
