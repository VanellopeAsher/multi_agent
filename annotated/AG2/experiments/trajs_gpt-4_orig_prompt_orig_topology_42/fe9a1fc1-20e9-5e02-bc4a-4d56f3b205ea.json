You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKatarina has 5 less cookies than Max has.

Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies: Katarina = 68\n\nWe can first solve the equation for Katarina to find out the number of cookies Max has, and then use this value to find out the number of cookies Cookie Monster and Summer have. Finally, we can add them together to get the total number of cookies.\n\nLet's implement this using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# Define the variables\nMax, CookieMonster, Summer = symbols('Max CookieMonster Summer')\n# Define the equations\nKatarina = Max - 5\nMax = 1.2 * (CookieMonster + 10)\nSummer = Max + 23\nKatarina = 68\n# Use sympy to solve the equations\nMax_value = solve(Katarina - Max, Max)[0]\nCookieMonster_value = solve(Max - 1.2 * (CookieMonster + 10), CookieMonster)[0]\nSummer_value = solve(Summer - Max_value - 23, Summer)[0]\n# Calculate the total number of cookies\ntotal_cookies = Max_value + CookieMonster_value + Summer_value + Katarina\nprint(total_cookies)\n```\n\nLet's run the code."
