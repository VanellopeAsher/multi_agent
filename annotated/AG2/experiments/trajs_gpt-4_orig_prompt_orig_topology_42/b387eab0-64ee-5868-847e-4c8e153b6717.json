If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, and they have a coupon that offers a 10% discount on the total price after cashback, how much will they pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.

For 10 gallons therefore, the cost after cashback would be $2.80 * 10.\nThe coupon offers a 10% discount off this price. This means that the actual amount paid will be 90% of the cost after cashback.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate the final amount paid:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# the initial price per gallon\ninitial_price_per_gallon = 3.00\n\n# the cashback per gallon\ncashback_per_gallon = 0.20\n\n# number of gallons\nnumber_of_gallons = 10\n\n# calculate cost after cashback\ncost_after_cashback = (initial_price_per_gallon - cashback_per_gallon) * number_of_gallons\n\n# calculate the discount\ndiscount = 0.10\n\n# calculate final price after applying the coupon\nfinal_price = cost_after_cashback * (1 - discount)\n\nprint(final_price)\n```\n\nThis program calculates the final price after applying both the cashback and the coupon."
