  "problem": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.
