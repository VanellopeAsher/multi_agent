You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

To find the total number of wheels in the box initially, we need to add the total number of wheels used to the number of wheels left in the box after assembly.\n\nWe can calculate the number of wheels used by the cars with the Python expression `4 * 57`, which means 4 wheels per car times the number of cars. \n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the number of wheels used by the motorcycles with `2 * 73`, which stands for 2 wheels per motorcycle times the number of motorcycles.\n\nThen we add up these two numbers with the number of wheels left, `276`.\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate it.\n\n```python\n# Write Python code here\nnum_cars = 57\nnum_motorcycles = 73\nwheels_per_car = 4\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\nwheels_left = 276\n\nwheels_used_cars = num_cars * wheels_per_car\nwheels_used_motorcycles = num_motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle\n\ntotal_wheels = wheels_used_cars + wheels_used_motorcycles + wheels_left\n\nprint(total_wheels)\n```"
