You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nColby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, or 5 pennies, we divide the total amount of money Colby has by 5 to get how many gumballs he can buy.\n\nHere is a Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nquarters = 80\ndimes = 60\nnickels = 140\npennies = 150\n\n# Each quarter is 25 cents, each dime is 10 cents, each nickel is 5 cents\ntotal_money_pennies = quarters * 25 + dimes * 10 + nickels * 5 + pennies \n\n# Each gumball costs 5 pennies\ngumballs = total_money_pennies // 5 \n\nprint(gumballs)\n```\n\nThis script first calculates the total amount of money Colby has in pennies. Then, it calculates the amount of gumballs he can buy by dividing the total amount of money by 5 (since each gumball costs 5 pennies). The result will be printed out.\n\nWould you like to run this code?"
