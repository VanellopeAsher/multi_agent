You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

It's a basic division problem. \n\nSince Marty initially cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts, and then each part is cut into 5 equal parts, the final cut will be 1/(4*5) = 1/20 of the initial length of the ribbon.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this computation. We use the sympy package's Rational function to get the exact fractional result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Let's assign the initial ribbon length as 1 (since we are cutting it into equal parts, the actual length is not relevant)\ninitial_length = 1\n\n# Compute the final cut length\nfinal_cut_length = Rational(initial_length, 4*5)\n\n# print the result\nprint(\"Each final cut will be:\", final_cut_length)\n```"
