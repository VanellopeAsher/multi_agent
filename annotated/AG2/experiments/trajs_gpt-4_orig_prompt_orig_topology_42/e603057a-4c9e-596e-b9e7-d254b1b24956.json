You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSeth is twice as old as Brooke.

The first equation is derived from the statement \"Seth is twice as old as Brooke,\" and the second equation is derived from the statement \"In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36.\" Solving this system of equations will give us the ages of Seth and Brooke.\n\nHere is how we can solve the problem using Python and sympy package:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbols\ns, b = symbols('s b')\n\n# set up the equations\neq1 = Eq(s, 2*b)  # Seth is twice as old as Brooke\neq2 = Eq(s + 3 + b + 3, 36)  # In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36\n\n# solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1,eq2), (s, b))\n\n# print the age of Seth\nprint('Seth is', solution[s], 'years old.')\n```"
