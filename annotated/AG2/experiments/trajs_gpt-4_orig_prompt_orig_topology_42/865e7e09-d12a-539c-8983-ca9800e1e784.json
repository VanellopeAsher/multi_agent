You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo girls each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water.

Since each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water, we simply multiply 1/4 by 32. \n\nAfter that we subtract the amount the girls got and the 8 liters the boy got from the total of 32 liters to get the amount of water that was left.\n\nWe can solve this problem directly using Python. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total amount of water\ntotal_water = 32\n\n# each girl got 1/4 of the water\nwater_girls = total_water / 4 * 2\n\n# the boy got 8 liters\nwater_boy = 8\n\n# calculate the remaining water\nremaining_water = total_water - water_girls - water_boy\n\nprint(remaining_water)\n```"
