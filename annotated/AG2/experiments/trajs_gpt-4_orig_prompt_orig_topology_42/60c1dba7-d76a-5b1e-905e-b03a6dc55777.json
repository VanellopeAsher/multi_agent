You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

We can set up a system of equations representing these relationships and solve for the unknowns.\n\nWe can let:\nB = Number of cards Becca has\nS = Number of cards Smendrick has\nP = Number of cards PJ has\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n1. The total number of cards is 447, so B + S + P = 447.\n2. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick, so B = S + 15.\n3. Smendrick has 4 times the number of cards that PJ has, so S = 4P.\n\nWe can substitute equations 2 and 3 into equation 1 to find the values of B, S, and P.\n\nLet's start with the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nB, S, P = symbols('B S P')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(B + S + P, 447)\neq2 = Eq(B, S + 15)\neq3 = Eq(S, 4*P)\n\n# Substitute eq2 and eq3 into eq1\neq1_subs = eq1.subs({B: eq2.args[1], S: eq3.args[1]})\n\n# Solve for P\nP_value = solve(eq1_subs, P)[0]\n\n# Substitute P_value into eq3 to get S\nS_value = solve(eq3.subs(P, P_value), S)[0]\n\n# Substitute S_value into eq2 to get B\nB_value = solve(eq2.subs(S, S_value), B)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Becca has {B_value} cards.\")\n```"
