You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn is a carpenter.

We'll calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then sum these together to find out the total amount that Ali has to pay.\n\nHere is the key idea:\n1. Multiply the number of tables by the cost of each table to find the total cost of tables.\n2. Multiply the number of roof frames by the cost of each roof frame to find the total cost of roof frames.\n3. Add the total cost of tables and the total cost of roof frames together to find the total cost that Ali has to pay.\n\nLet's solve it with Python:\n\n```python\n# the number of tables and the cost of each table\nnum_tables, cost_table = 40, 200\n\n# the number of roof frames and the cost of each roof frame\nnum_frames, cost_frame = 20, 100\n\n# calculate the total cost of tables and roof frames\ntotal_cost = num_tables * cost_table + num_frames * cost_frame\n\n# print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nYou can run this code to get the answer."
