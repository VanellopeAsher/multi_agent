You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural. Here's the key idea:\n\nThe total amount of paint is 12 pints. We know that half of the mural is yellow, so 6 pints are yellow. The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among the red, white, and purple colors.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of yellow paint: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6\\) pints.\n2. The remaining paint (red, white, purple): \\(12 - 6 = 6\\) pints.\n3. Since red, white, and purple are used in equal amounts, each color uses: \\(\\frac{6}{3} = 2\\) pints.\n\nHere's the Python code to confirm this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# total paint\ntotal_paint = 12\n\n# yellow paint is half of total\nyellow_paint = Rational(1, 2) * total_paint\n\n# red, white, purple are the remaining paint\nremaining_paint = total_paint - yellow_paint\n\n# each of the red, white and purple have equal amounts\nred_paint = remaining_paint / 3\n\n# output the amount of red paint\nprint(red_paint)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the amount of red paint used, which should be \\(2\\) pints.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
