You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the calculation steps:\n\n1. **Cost per bottle of scotch**: Since John bought 10 bottles of scotch for $600, each bottle costs $60.\n\n2. **Cost per bottle of cognac**: A bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch, so it costs $60 \\times 1.5 = $90.\n\n3. **Total cost for cognac**: John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys 20 bottles of cognac. The total cost is therefore \\(20 \\times 90 = 1800\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Total expenditure**: Adding the cost of scotch and cognac gives us \\(600 + 1800 = 2400\\) dollars.\n\nJohn's total expenditure on both scotch and cognac is \\(\\boxed{2400}\\) dollars."
