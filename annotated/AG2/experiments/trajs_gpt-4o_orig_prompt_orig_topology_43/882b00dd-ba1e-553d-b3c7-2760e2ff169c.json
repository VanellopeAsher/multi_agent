On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

Calculate Billy's hourly wage after his raises:\n   - Initial hourly rate: $10.00\n   - After 2 months, raise by $0.50: $10.50\n   - At the first anniversary, raise by $1.00: $11.50\n\n2. Calculate Sally's hourly wage after her raises:\n   - Initial hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's initial rate: $10.50\n   - After 2 months, raise by $0.50: $11.00\n\n3. Calculate their total earnings for 20 hours:\n   - Billy's earnings: $11.50 * 20\n   - Sally's earnings: $11.00 * 20\n   \n4. Determine the difference in earnings.\n\nLet's put this into code:\n\n```python\n# Billy's total earnings\nbilly_hourly_wage = 11.50\nbilly_total_hours = 20\nbilly_earnings = billy_hourly_wage * billy_total_hours\n\n# Sally's total earnings\nsally_hourly_wage = 11.00\nsally_total_hours = 20\nsally_earnings = sally_hourly_wage * sally_total_hours\n\n# Difference in earnings\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Print the result in box format\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(f\"Billy's earnings: {billy_earnings}, Sally's earnings: {sally_earnings}\")\nprint(f\"Difference in their earnings: \\\\boxed({difference})\")\n```\n\nRunning this, we compute the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally."
