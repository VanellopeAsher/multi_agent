You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how fast John runs, which means finding out his average running speed in miles per hour. Here's how to approach the problem:\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided:\n- John runs a total of 60 miles a week.\n- He runs 3 days a week.\n- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n- On the second and third days, he runs for 1.5 hours each (since it's half as much as the time he runs on the first day).\n\nNow let's calculate how many total hours John runs during the week:\n- First day: 3 hours\n- Second day: 1.5 hours\n- Third day: 1.5 hours\n\nThus, the total time spent running in a week is:\n\\[3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \\text{ hours}\\]\n\nNow, since he runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours, we can find his average speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours.\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate this, while also making sure to output fractions instead of decimals:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total miles run in a week\ntotal_miles = 60\n\n# Total hours run in a week\ntotal_hours = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5\n\n# Calculate average speed in miles per hour\naverage_speed = Rational(total_miles, total_hours)\n\n# Output the average speed\nprint(average_speed)\n```\n\nThis will give us John's average running speed in miles per hour as a fraction.\n\nNow, let's evaluate this to find the answer:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total miles run in a week\ntotal_miles = 60\n\n# Total hours run in a week\ntotal_hours = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5\n\n# Calculate average speed in miles per hour\naverage_speed = Rational(total_miles, total_hours)\n\n# Output the average speed\nprint(average_speed)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give you John's running speed, \\(\\boxed{10} \\text{ miles per hour}\\)."
