You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total area of fabric from medium and large t-shirts that Octavia used, and then determine how many small t-shirts were needed to reach a total of 101 square feet.\n\nKey idea: \nThis problem can be solved directly using a simple equation. We'll calculate the area contributed by the known numbers of medium and large t-shirts and use this information to solve for the number of small t-shirts needed.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the area from medium t-shirts: \\( 8 \\times 4 \\) square feet.\n2. Calculate the area from large t-shirts: \\( 6 \\times 6 \\) square feet.\n3. Subtract the sum of these areas from the total quilt area to find the area contributed by small t-shirts.\n4. Divide the remaining area by the area per small t-shirt (3 square feet) to find how many small t-shirts were used.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\ntotal_area = 101\nmedium_shirt_area = 4\nlarge_shirt_area = 6\nsmall_shirt_area = 3\nnum_medium_shirts = 8\nnum_large_shirts = 6\n\n# Calculate the known total area from medium and large shirts\narea_from_medium = num_medium_shirts * medium_shirt_area\narea_from_large = num_large_shirts * large_shirt_area\n\n# Remaining area to be covered by small shirts\nremaining_area = total_area - (area_from_medium + area_from_large)\n\n# Define the variable for the number of small shirts\nnum_small_shirts = symbols('num_small_shirts')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(num_small_shirts * small_shirt_area, remaining_area)\n\n# Solve for the number of small shirts\nsolution = solve(equation, num_small_shirts)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nAfter executing this code, the number of small t-shirts Octavia used will be given by the solution, boxed for clarity."
