You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Multiply the result by the number of weeks.\n3. Output the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of films watched on Saturday\nfilms_on_saturday = 4\n\n# Number of films watched on Sunday\nfilms_on_sunday = films_on_saturday / 2\n\n# Total films on a single weekend\ntotal_films_per_weekend = films_on_saturday + films_on_sunday\n\n# Total number of weeks\ntotal_weeks = 4\n\n# Total number of films in 4 weeks\ntotal_films_in_4_weeks = total_films_per_weekend * total_weeks\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_films_in_4_weeks)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we will calculate the total number of films Jill and her companions view in a span of 4 weeks."
