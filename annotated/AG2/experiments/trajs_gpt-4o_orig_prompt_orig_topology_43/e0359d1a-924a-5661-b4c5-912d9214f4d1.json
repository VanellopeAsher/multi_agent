You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of candy and then divide it equally among Robert, Cindy, and Aaron.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Amount of Candy:**\n   - Robert has 3 pounds of candy.\n   - Cindy has 5 pounds of candy.\n   - Aaron has 4 pounds of candy.\n\n2. **Sum up the total candy:**\n   - Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy.\n\n3. **Divide the Total Candy Equally Among the Three:**\n   - Each person will get an equal portion of the total candy.\n\nLet's write Python code using the sympy library to handle any fractions involved, even though in this case there are no fractional parts. We will adhere to the format requirement given in the prompt:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate total candy\nrobert_candy = 3\ncindy_candy = 5\naaron_candy = 4\n\ntotal_candy = robert_candy + cindy_candy + aaron_candy\n\n# Calculate each person's share\neach_share = Rational(total_candy, 3)\n\n# Print the result in fractional form\nprint(f\"Each person gets {each_share} pounds of candy.\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this Python code, it will give us the amount of candy each person would have after sharing equally."
