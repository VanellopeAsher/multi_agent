  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of time John spent on all his activities.\n\nHere's the key point: the percentage of time for each activity sums up to 100%. We will use this information to find the time John spent sightseeing.\n\nWe'll go step-by-step to solve this:\n\n1. Calculate the total time John spent on activities before knowing the sightseeing time.\n2. Use the percentage information to determine the time spent on sightseeing since we know it's 40% of his total time spent on activities.\n\nLet's compute the individual times first:\n\n- Boating: 6 hours\n- Swimming: \\(6 / 2 = 3\\) hours\n- Shows: \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) hours\n- Total known time spent (Boating + Swimming + Shows): 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours\n\nThe problem tells us these 15 hours account for 30% of the activities. So, the total activity time (\\(x\\)) satisfies:\n\n\\[\n0.3x = 15\n\\]\n\nNow, we will use Python to solve for \\(x\\) and find the time spent sightseeing (40% of the total activities time).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the total activity time\nx = Symbol('x')\n\n# Create the equation\nequation = Eq(0.3 * x, 15)\n\n# Solve for x\ntotal_time = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate the sightseeing time (40% of total time)\nsightseeing_time = total_time * 0.4\n\n# Print the result\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, the calculated result will give us the hours John spent sightseeing. The final answer should be presented in a boxed format as \\(\\boxed{\\text{sightseeing_time}}\\)."
