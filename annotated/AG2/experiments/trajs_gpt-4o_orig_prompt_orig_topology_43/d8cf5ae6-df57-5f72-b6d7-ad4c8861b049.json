  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

Calculating the total weight of each type of feed.\n2. Summing up these weights to find the total feed weight.\n3. Dividing this total weight by 2 since the transport must happen in two trips.\n\nLet's calculate using Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library to keep it in fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculating total weight for each category of feed\nsugar_cubes_weight = 2 * 1  # pounds\ncarrots_weight = 4 * 12  # pounds\nhay_weight = 42 * 75  # pounds\noats_weight = 20 * 65  # pounds\n\n# Calculating the total weight\ntotal_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight\n\n# Calculating weight per trip\nweight_per_trip = Rational(total_weight, 2)\n\n# Printing the weight per trip in a fraction form\nprint(weight_per_trip)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We used the Rational function from SymPy to ensure the output remains in fraction/radical form rather than a decimal.\n- This will calculate and print the weight the farm truck can carry per trip."
