You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We can directly calculate the ages and sum them up to find the total.\n\n- We know there are 10 sisters, each 16 years old.\n- One brother is 12 years old, and he is half the age of the older brother.\n- From the information about the brothers, we can determine the age of the older brother.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Number of sisters and their age\nnum_sisters = 10\nage_sister = 16\n\n# Age of the younger brother\nage_younger_brother = 12\n\n# Define the variable for the older brother's age\nage_older_brother = symbols('age_older_brother')\n\n# The older brother's age is double the age of the younger brother\nequation = Eq(age_older_brother, 2 * age_younger_brother)\n\n# Solve for the older brother's age\nage_older_brother_value = solve(equation)[0]\n\n# Calculate the total age of all siblings\ntotal_age_sisters = num_sisters * age_sister\ntotal_age_brothers = age_younger_brother + age_older_brother_value\ntotal_age = total_age_sisters + total_age_brothers\n\nprint(f\"Total age of all siblings: {total_age}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total age of all the siblings.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations:\n\n1. **Sisters' Total Age:**\n   - There are 10 sisters.\n   - Each sister is 16 years old.\n   - Total age of sisters = \\(10 \\times 16 = 160\\).\n\n2. **Age of the Brothers:**\n   - One brother is 12 years old.\n   - The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Total Age of Brothers:**\n   - Younger brother = 12 years.\n   - Older brother = 24 years.\n   - Total age of brothers = \\(12 + 24 = 36\\).\n\n4. **Total Age of All Siblings:**\n   - Total age = Total age of sisters + Total age of brothers\n   - Total age = \\(160 + 36 = 196\\).\n\nSo, the corrected total age of all the siblings is \\(\\boxed{196}\\).
