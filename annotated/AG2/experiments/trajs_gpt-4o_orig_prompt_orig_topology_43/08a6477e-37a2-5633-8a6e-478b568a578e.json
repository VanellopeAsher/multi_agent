Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Bandage Count**: The nurses started with 19 bandages.\n2. **Bandage Orders**: \n   - On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.\n   - On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, so they got an additional 100 bandages.\n3. **Usage**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of bandages used on the first day.\n   - On the second day, they used \\( x - 10 \\) bandages.\n   - On the third day, they used half a pack, which is \\( 25 \\) bandages.\n\n4. **Equation Formation**: Use the information to set up an equation based on total bandages used and remaining:\n   - Bandages available = Starting bandages + Bandages ordered = \\( 19 + 50 + 100 \\).\n   - Bandages used by the end of the third day = \\( x + (x - 10) + 25 \\).\n   - According to the problem, 78 bandages were left at the end of the third day.\n\nWith these, let's set up and solve the equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate total bandages initially and after orders\ntotal_bandages = 19 + 50 + 100  # Starting with 19, ordered 1 pack on day 1, 2 packs on day 3\n\n# Bandages remaining = Total bandages - Used bandages\n# Bandages used:\n# Day 1: x bandages\n# Day 2: x - 10 bandages\n# Day 3: 25 bandages\n\n# Remaining bandages after day 3\nremaining_bandages = 78\n\n# Equation: total_bandages - (x + (x - 10) + 25) = remaining_bandages\nbandage_equation = Eq(total_bandages - (x + (x - 10) + 25), remaining_bandages)\n\n# Solve the equation\nfirst_day_usage = solve(bandage_equation, x)\nprint(first_day_usage[0])  # we expect a single solution\n```\n\nThe solution to this equation will give us the number of bandages used on the first day."
