You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.

Here's the key idea:\n\n**Key Idea:** Calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 12 weeks, then convert that number into dozens.\n\n1. Calculate the number of days in 12 weeks.\n2. Determine how many eggs are consumed by multiplying the number of days by the number of eggs per day.\n3. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of eggs used for each omelet\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# Number of days in 12 weeks\ndays = 12 * 7\n\n# Total eggs used in 12 weeks\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_day * days\n\n# Convert eggs to dozens\ndozens = total_eggs / 12\n\nprint(dozens)  # Output should be the number of dozens\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]\n\nThis means Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks."
