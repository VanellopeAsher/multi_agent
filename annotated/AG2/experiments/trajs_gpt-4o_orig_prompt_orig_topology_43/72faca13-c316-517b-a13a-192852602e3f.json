You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents, how many cents will she have left?"

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is quite simple as it is a basic arithmetic calculation problem. We will start by determining the total amount of money Kelly has and then subtract the costs of the items she buys to find out how much money she will have left. This can be directly implemented in Python.\n\nLet's detail the steps:\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has with 5 quarters and 2 dimes.\n2. Sum the costs of the can of pop and the candy bar.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the total money Kelly has to find the remaining amount.\n\nTo calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Value of quarters and dimes in cents\nquarter_value = 25\ndime_value = 10\n\n# Total quarters and dimes Kelly has\nnum_quarters = 5\nnum_dimes = 2\n\n# Total amount of money Kelly has in cents\ntotal_money = num_quarters * quarter_value + num_dimes * dime_value\n\n# Costs of items Kelly buys\npop_cost = 55\ncandy_bar_cost = 45\n\n# Total spending\ntotal_spending = pop_cost + candy_bar_cost\n\n# Money left after purchases\nmoney_left = total_money - total_spending\n\n# Print the answer using the print function\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nOnce executed, this will give us the number of cents Kelly has left."

Kelly starts with 5 quarters and 2 dimes, which gives her \\(5 \\times 25 + 2 \\times 10 = 125 + 20 = 145\\) cents in total.\n\nShe spends 55 cents on a can of pop and 45 cents on a candy bar. Adding these expenses together, her total spending is \\(55 + 45 = 100\\) cents.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Kelly has left is \\(145 - 100 = 45\\) cents.\n\nSo, after her purchases, Kelly will have \\(\\boxed{45}\\) cents left."
