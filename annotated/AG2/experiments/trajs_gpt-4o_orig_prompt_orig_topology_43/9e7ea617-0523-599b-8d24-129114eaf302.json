Let's go through the problem step by step again to ensure everything is clear and accurate:\n\n### Problem Summary\n- **Tree 1 (Shortest Tree):** Height = 60 feet\n- **Tree 2:** Its height is 50 feet more than Tree 1: \n  \\[\n  60 + 50 = 110 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n- **Combined Height of Tree 1 and Tree 2:**\n  \\[\n  60 + 110 = 170 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n- **Tree 3 (Tallest Tree):** Its height is defined as twice the combined height of Tree 1 and Tree 2:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Height of Tree 3} = 2 \\times 170 = 340 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the height of the tallest tree is \\(\\boxed{340}\\) feet.\n\n### Verification with Python Code\n\nTo ensure that every step in the calculation is correct, here's the Python code to validate the result:\n\n```python\n# Define heights of trees\nshortest_tree_height = 60\nsecond_tree_height = shortest_tree_height + 50\n\n# Calculate combined height of first two trees\ncombined_height = shortest_tree_height + second_tree_height\n\n# Calculate height of the tallest tree\ntallest_tree_height = 2 * combined_height\n\n# Print the result\nprint(tallest_tree_height)\n```\n\nRunning this code will confirm the height of the tallest tree is indeed 340 feet. If there's something specific you'd like me to adjust or explore further in this solution, please let me know!"
