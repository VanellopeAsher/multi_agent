You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26.

Therefore, we'll follow Case 1, where the problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.\n2. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount expended.\n\nLet's write the Python program to carry out these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the prices of the items\nprice_of_pots = 19\nprice_of_soil = 26\n\n# Calculate the total cost before discount\ntotal_cost = price_of_pots + price_of_soil\n\n# Discount applied\ndiscount = 7\n\n# Calculate the total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = total_cost - discount\n\n# Print the total expenditure\nprint(total_expenditure)\n```\n\nNow let's compute the result to find out the total expenditure by executing this code."
