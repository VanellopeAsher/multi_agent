You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

Here's the approach we'll take:\n\nCase 1: We can solve this directly using Python, as it involves straightforward arithmetic calculations.\n\n1. Calculate the total time spent at work from Monday to Thursday.\n2. Calculate the total time spent at work on Friday.\n3. Find out the total number of calls based on the 15-minute call time.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define times in hours\ndaily_hours = 6\nfriday_extra_hours = 2\ntotal_days = 5\nminutes_per_call = 15\n\n# Calculate total hours for Monday to Thursday\nweekday_hours = daily_hours * 4\n\n# Calculate total hours on Friday\nfriday_hours = daily_hours + friday_extra_hours\n\n# Calculate total work hours in a week\ntotal_hours = weekday_hours + friday_hours\n\n# Convert total hours to total minutes\ntotal_minutes = total_hours * 60\n\n# Calculate the number of calls Tim can handle\ncalls = total_minutes / minutes_per_call\n\n# Convert calls to a rational number to avoid decimals\nnumber_of_calls = Rational(calls)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_calls)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, including the extra hours on Friday, in fraction form."
