We will use algebraic reasoning to set up and solve this problem with Python. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define variables:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of 5 canvas bags Tara bought.\n\n2. Define the cost and revenue:\n   - The cost for \\( x \\) packs is \\( 4x \\) dollars.\n   - The number of canvas bags is \\( 5x \\).\n   - The revenue from selling these bags is \\( 8 \\times 5x = 40x \\) dollars.\n\n3. Define the profit:\n   - Profit is revenue minus cost, so her profit is \\( 40x - 4x = 36x \\) dollars.\n\n4. Set up the equation for profit:\n   - We know the profit is $160, so \\( 36x = 160 \\).\n\n5.
