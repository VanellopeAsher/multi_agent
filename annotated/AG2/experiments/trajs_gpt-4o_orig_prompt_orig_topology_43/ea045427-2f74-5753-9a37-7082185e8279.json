You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each.

We can break down the calculation step by step and use Python to perform the arithmetic.\n\nHere's how we can solve it:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the notebooks William bought.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the ballpen he bought.\n3. Calculate the cost of the pencil case, which is twice the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens.\n4. Add all these costs together to find out the total amount spent.\n\nLet's proceed with the Python code to compute the requested values:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices\nnotebook_price = Rational(3, 2)  # $1.50 each in fractional form\nballpen_price = Rational(1, 2)   # $0.50 each in fractional form\n\n# Quantities\nnotebooks_bought = 5\nballpens_bought = 1\n\n# Total cost calculations\ntotal_notebooks_cost = notebooks_bought * notebook_price\ntotal_ballpen_cost = ballpens_bought * ballpen_price\n\n# Cost of pencil case\npencil_case_cost = 2 * (notebook_price + 2 * ballpen_price)\n\n# Total spent\ntotal_spent = total_notebooks_cost + total_ballpen_cost + pencil_case_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give the total amount William spent in a fractional form."

The cost for one ballpen at $0.50 is:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 0.50 = 0.50\n   \\]\n\n3. The cost of one notebook and two ballpens is:\n   \\[\n   1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50 = 2.50\n   \\]\n\n4. The cost of the pencil case, being twice the cost of one notebook and two ballpens, is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\n   \\]\n\n5. Adding these costs gives the total amount William spent:\n   \\[\n   7.50 + 0.50 + 5.00 = 13.00\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total amount spent is indeed \\(\\boxed{13}\\), which matches the output you provided."
