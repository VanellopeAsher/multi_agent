You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Monday, a water tank measured 17 feet deep.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nTo solve this problem, we need to track the water depth changes over three days, using basic arithmetic operations. We can easily calculate the water depth on each day and determine the depth on Wednesday. This falls under Case 1 as we can solve the problem through straightforward calculations.\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial depth on Monday\ndepth_monday = 17\n\n# Increase in depth on Tuesday\nincrease_tuesday = 7\ndepth_tuesday = depth_monday + increase_tuesday\n\n# Depth on Wednesday is two-thirds of the Tuesday depth\ndepth_wednesday = Rational(2, 3) * depth_tuesday\n\nprint(depth_wednesday)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the water depth on Wednesday in fractional form using the SymPy library, ensuring the result is in the preferred format without decimals. Running this will provide the water depth in the tank on Wednesday."
