You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, I'll use a combination of reasoning and simple mathematical operations, making it resemble Case 1 from the problem-solving strategies.\n\n### Key Idea\n\n1. First, determine the total time John spent on vacation. \n   - John spends 60 hours boating.\n   - He spends half that time swimming: \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) hours.\n   - He watches 30 different shows, each 20 hours: \\( 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\) hours.\n   - Watching shows accounts for 30% of his total vacation time.\n\n2. Then we can set up an equation using the percentage information:\n   - Total time spent = time spent watching shows / 0.3.\n\n3. Calculate the total time spent and then determine how much time was spent sightseeing.\n   - Time spent sightseeing is 40% of total time.\n\nHereâ€™s the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the total time variable\ntotal_time = symbols('total_time')\n\n# Time spent on activities\nboating_time = 60\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 30 * 20\n\n# Shows time accounts for 30% of total vacation time\nequation = Eq(shows_time, 0.3 * total_time)\n\n# Solve for the total vacation time\ntotal_time_value = solve(equation, total_time)[0]\n\n# Time spent sightseeing (40% of total time)\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time_value\n\n# Output the sightseeing time\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nRun this code to find out the time John spent sightseeing. Once the Python code is executed, we will be able to calculate the required time."
