You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts.

Determine the labor cost given the number of hours.\n3. Add the cost of parts.\n4. Sum these amounts to get the total bill.\n\nGiven:\n- Service fee: $40\n- Labor rate: $35 per hour or fraction of an hour\n- Parts cost: $60\n- Hours worked: 2.25\n\nSince labor is charged in fractions of an hour, 2.25 hours will be rounded up to the next full hour, which is 3 hours.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# given values\nservice_fee = 40\nlabor_rate_per_hour = 35\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# calculating total labor hours, round up 2.25 to the nearest whole number, which is 3\ntotal_hours_of_labor = 3\nlabor_cost = total_hours_of_labor * labor_rate_per_hour\n\n# calculate total bill\ntotal_cost = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\n\n# output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the total amount billed by Patty:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Service Fee: } \\$40 \\\\\n\\text{Labor Cost (3 hours): } 3 \\times \\$35 = \\$105 \\\\\n\\text{Parts Cost: } \\$60 \\\\\n\\text{Total Amount Billed: } \\$40 + \\$105 + \\$60 = \\$205\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total billed amount is \\(\\boxed{205}\\)."
