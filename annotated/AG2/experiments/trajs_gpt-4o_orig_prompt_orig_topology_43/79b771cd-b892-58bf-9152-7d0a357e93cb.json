Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon while holding the sapphire gemstone and still be able to hit the dragon with the javelin. The problem essentially involves calculating the effective throwing distance of Polly and then determining the safe distance from the dragon.\n\nLet's approach this through Case 1, as it involves straightforward calculations. Here's the solution:\n\n1. Determine the effective throwing distance of Polly when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.\n2. Calculate the difference in distance between the edge of the dragon's fire reach and the farthest point Polly can throw.\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 4000 feet.\n2. With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 3 times farther than without it. So, her effective throwing distance is \\(3 \\times 4000 = 12000\\) feet.\n3. The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 10000 feet.\n4. To determine how far outside this 10000 feet of danger zone Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we calculate \\(12000 - 10000 = 2000\\) feet.\n\nPolly can stand 2000 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still be able to hit the dragon with the javelin.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define distances\nthrow_distance_without_gem = 4000  # in feet\nfire_breath_distance = 10000  # in feet\n\n# Calculate effective throw distance with gem\nthrow_distance_with_gem = 3 * throw_distance_without_gem\n\n# Calculate safe standing distance outside dragon's reach\nsafe_distance = throw_distance_with_gem - fire_breath_distance\n\n# Print result in a box\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve\n\n# Using sympy to express the solution if needed for the box format\nx = Symbol('x')\neq = Eq(safe_distance, x)\n\nresult = solve(eq, x)[0]\nprint(f\"\\\\boxed{{{result}}}\")\n```\n\nThis will determine that Polly can stand \\(\\boxed{2000}\\) feet safely outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the sapphire gemstone."
