You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 100 miles a week.

Determine the time spent running each day.\n2. Calculate the total time he spends running in a week.\n3. Use the total distance and total time to find his average speed.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Time spent running each day\n# John's running schedule:\n# Day 1: He runs for 10 hours.\ntime_day1 = 10\n\n# Days 2 and 3: He runs half as much as on Day 1.\ntime_day2 = time_day3 = Rational(time_day1, 2)\n\n# Step 2: Total time spent running in a week\ntotal_time = time_day1 + time_day2 + time_day3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate his speed\n# Total distance covered in a week: 100 miles\ntotal_distance = 100\n\n# Calculate average speed (distance divided by time)\naverage_speed = Rational(total_distance, total_time)\n\n# Print the average speed\nprint('Average speed (miles per hour):', average_speed)\n```\n\nRun this Python code to find John's average running speed."
