Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Calculate the total amount of money from the $10 bills.\n2. Calculate the total amount of money from the $20 bills.\n3. Add these amounts together to get the total initial amount of money Ali has.\n4. Ali gives half of this total money to his sister.\n5.

Let's continue with the calculation based on the result provided.\n\nAfter executing the code, we found that Ali has $32 after buying dinner.\n\nTo explain the result in context:\n\n1. Ali initially has a total of $160, calculated as:\n   - $40 from four $10 bills (4 * 10)\n   - $120 from six $20 bills (6 * 20)\n   - Total = $40 + $120 = $160\n\n2. Ali gives half of the $160 to his sister, which amounts to $80. This leaves Ali with $80.\n\n3. Ali spends \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of his remaining $80 on dinner:\n   - \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = 48 \\)\n\n4. Therefore, the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is $80 (remaining) - $48 (dinner expense) = $32.\n\nHence, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]\n\nAli has $32 left after buying dinner."
