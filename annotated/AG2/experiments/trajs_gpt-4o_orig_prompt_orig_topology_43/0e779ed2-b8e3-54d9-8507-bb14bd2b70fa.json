You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Determine the age of the younger brother.\n   - The younger brother is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 \\) years old.\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 \\).\n\n3.

Calculate the total age of all siblings.\n   - Add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python with the `sympy` package to ensure that we maintain fractions and avoid decimals where needed.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the age of each sibling\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10\nyounger_brother_age = Rational(3, 5) * 20\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Total age calculation\ntotal_age = 3 * sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nLet's execute this program."
