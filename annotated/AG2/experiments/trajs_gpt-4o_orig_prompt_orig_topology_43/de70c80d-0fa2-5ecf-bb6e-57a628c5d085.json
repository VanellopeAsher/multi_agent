You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

The English alphabet contains 26 letters.\n2. Elise writes the alphabet in full three times.\n3. She writes half of it once, which is 13 letters since half of 26 is 13.\n4. She then rewrites everything she has already written.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Total letters written in full three times: \\(3 \\times 26\\)\n- Total letters written half once: \\(13\\)\n- Total letters from re-writing everything she has already written: This would be the sum of the above two calculations (total written) multiplied by 2 (since she rewrites it once).\n\nNow let's write a Python program to calculate this.\n\n```python\n# Number of letters in the alphabet\nletters_in_alphabet = 26\n\n# Calculate the number of letters written\nfull_alphabets_written = 3 * letters_in_alphabet\nhalf_alphabet_written = letters_in_alphabet // 2\n\n# Total letters written before re-writing\ntotal_written_before_rewrite = full_alphabets_written + half_alphabet_written\n\n# Total letters including rewriting\ntotal_letters_written = 2 * total_written_before_rewrite\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_letters_written)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of letters Elise has written. \n\nLet's calculate."
