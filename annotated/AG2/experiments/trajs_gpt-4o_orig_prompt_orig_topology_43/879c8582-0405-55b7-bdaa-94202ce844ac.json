You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

After keeping 50 cards for herself, we'll divide the remaining cards among the students, with each student receiving 10 cards.\n\nLet's go through the steps using Python:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards.\n3. Calculate the total number of soccer cards.\n4. Find the total number of cards.\n5. Subtract the 50 cards Miss Maria keeps.\n6. Divide the remaining cards by 10 to determine the number of students.\n\nWe will implement these steps in Python. Here's the code:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate number of cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\nsoccer_cards = 30\n\n# Calculate total cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards + soccer_cards\n\n# Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself\ncards_to_students = total_cards - 50\n\n# Each student gets 10 cards\nstudents = Rational(cards_to_students, 10)\n\n# Print the number of students\nprint(students)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the number of students Miss Maria has."
