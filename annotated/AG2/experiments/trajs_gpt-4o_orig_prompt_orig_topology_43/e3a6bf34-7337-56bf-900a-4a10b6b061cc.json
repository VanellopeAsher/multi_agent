      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1:** Determine how many yellow ties John bought.\n\nSince each yellow tie costs $30 and he spent $300, the number of yellow ties he bought is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow ties} = \\frac{300}{30} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the cost per green tie and the total cost for green ties.\n\nGreen ties cost 70% more than yellow ties:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one green tie} = 30 + 0.7 \\times 30 = 51\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Determine how many green ties John bought.\n\nSince John bought the same number of green and yellow ties, he bought 10 green ties:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for green ties} = 10 \\times 51 = 510\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the total number of ties.\n\nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. We do not have information on the number of red and blue ties, so we'll assume John bought \\( b \\) blue ties and \\( 2b \\) red ties.\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate the total cost.\n\nWe need more information to compute the number of blue and red ties or their costs. However, assuming the problem doesn't give us a way to find this and focuses primarily on yellow and green ties costs:\n\n- Total cost of yellow ties: $300\n- Total cost of green ties: $510\n\nThus, he spent:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 300 + 510 = 810\n\\]\n\nNow, let's encode this logic into Python to ensure it fits the problem's requirements.\n\n```python\n# Since the problem is focused on the amount spent on yellow and green ties,\n# with no additional information provided for red and blue ties, we'll calculate these costs.\n\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Cost calculations\nyellow_tie_cost = 30\nyellow_ties_bought = 300 // 30\ntotal_cost_yellow = yellow_tie_cost * yellow_ties_bought\n\ngreen_tie_cost = yellow_tie_cost + Rational(70, 100) * yellow_tie_cost\ngreen_ties_bought = yellow_ties_bought  # Same number of green ties as yellow ties\ntotal_cost_green = green_tie_cost * green_ties_bought\n\n# Total spent on ties (yellow and green)\ntotal_spent = total_cost_yellow + total_cost_green\n\n# Print the result\nfrom sympy import pprint\npprint(total_spent, use_unicode=True)\n```\n\nTherefore, the total amount John spent on the ties is \\(\\boxed{810}\\), assuming we're focusing on known costs associated with yellow and green ties."

Now, let's consider if there might be information regarding the red and blue ties that we overlooked or need to assume to continue solving the problem comprehensively.\n\n1. **Summary of Given Information:**\n   - John bought \\(10\\) yellow ties at $30 each: \\( \\text{Total} = 300 \\).\n   - Green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties, i.e., $51 each, for 10 ties: \\( \\text{Total} = 510 \\).\n\n2. **Information on Red and Blue Ties:**\n   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.\n   - Unfortunately, there is no specific information on the cost or quantity of either red or blue ties, nor the total budget spent on them separately.\n\nTo find a total spent on all ties, we must assume that the problem only concerns the information given. Given that red and blue ties lack detail, we should conclude calculations focus on yellow and green ties, i.e., $810.\n\nWithout further details or assumptions on red and blue ties, adding any value is not possible:\n\\[ \\text{Total amount spent on ties} = 300 + 510 = \\boxed{810} \\]\n\nThis solution assumes that the main computational focus was on explicit costs provided for yellow and green ties.
