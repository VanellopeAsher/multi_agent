You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each.

This can be directly computed, so we'll follow Case 1 and write a Python program for this.\n\nKey Steps:\n1. Calculate the total earnings from cookies.\n2. Calculate the total earnings from cupcakes.\n3. Subtract the amounts given to her sisters and the charity from the total earnings.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate earnings\ncookies_sold = 80\nprice_per_cookie = 1\ncupcakes_sold = 60\nprice_per_cupcake = 4\n\ntotal_earnings = (cookies_sold * price_per_cookie) + (cupcakes_sold * price_per_cupcake)\n\n# Calculate expenses\nsisters_gift = 2 * 10  # $10 each for two sisters\ncharity_donation = 15\n\n# Calculate money left\nmoney_left = total_earnings - (sisters_gift + charity_donation)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nWhen we run this code, it will compute the amount of money Suzanne has left."
