      "content": "In this problem, we need to determine how much money Walter's friend gave him. Here's the approach to solve the problem:\n\nKey Idea:\n- Walter collects money from neighbors and from an online fund, totaling $500 + $1500 = $2000.\n- Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times the amount everyone else donates.\n- The lawyer contributes $6600 in total.\n\nWe need to find out how much Walter's friend gave, which we'll denote as \\( x \\).\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\n1. The lawyer donates three times the total amount donated by everyone else, which includes both Walter's collections and his friend's contribution.\n2. Total donation by everyone else (neighbors, online fund, and friend) is \\( 2000 + x \\).\n3. The lawyer's donation is three times this total: \\( 3 \\times (2000 + x) = 6600 \\).\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times (2000 + x) = 6600 \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol for the unknown contribution by the friend\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(3 * (2000 + x), 6600)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nfriend_contribution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Display the result\nprint(f\"The amount Walter's friend gave him is: {friend_contribution[0]}\")\n```\n\nLet's resolve this step-by-step and solve the equation:\n\n1. Distribute the 3: \\( 3 \\times 2000 + 3x = 6600 \\)\n2. Simplify: \\( 6000 + 3x = 6600 \\)\n3. Subtract 6000 from both sides: \\( 3x = 600 \\)\n4. Divide by 3: \\( x = 200 \\)\n\nThe amount Walter's friend gave him is \\(\\boxed{200}\\)."
