You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many fewer white squares there are than green squares on Brittany's quilted comforter. We will follow through these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of blue squares.\n2. Calculate the number of green squares.\n3. Determine the number of white squares using the total number of squares and the previously calculated squares.\n4. Finally, calculate how many fewer white squares there are compared to green squares.\n\nSince this problem involves basic arithmetic calculations, it falls into Case 1, where we can directly solve it using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Import the required package\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the known values\nred_squares = 14\nblue_squares = red_squares + 4\ngreen_squares = blue_squares + 6\ntotal_squares = 68\n\n# Define the unknown (white squares)\nwhite_squares = symbols('white_squares')\n\n# Express the total squares equation\nequation = Eq(red_squares + blue_squares + green_squares + white_squares, total_squares)\n\n# Solve for white_squares\nwhite_squares_value = solve(equation, white_squares)[0]\n\n# Calculate how many fewer white squares there are compared to green squares\nfewer_white_than_green = green_squares - white_squares_value\n\n# Print the result\nprint(fewer_white_than_green)\n```\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of blue squares: \n   - \\( \\text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18 \\)\n2. Calculate the number of green squares:\n   - \\( \\text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24 \\)\n3. Determine the number of white squares based on the remaining total after accounting for red, blue, and green squares.\n   - Total squares = 68\n   - Total of colored squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) = 56\n   - \\( \\text{White squares} = 68 - 56 = 12 \\)\n4. Calculate the difference between green squares and white squares:\n   - \\( \\text{Difference} = 24 - 12 = 12 \\)\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{12}\\) fewer white squares than green squares."
