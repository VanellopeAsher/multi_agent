You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Angle:** The sun is positioned at the tip of the pyramid, which makes an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.\n2. **First Segment:** The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours.\n3. **Second Segment:** The sun continues moving for an additional 2 hours at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.\n\nThe total angle from the ground to the sun after these movements can be calculated by summing up the initial angle with the angle increments from both segments of movement.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial angle from the ground\ninitial_angle = 32\n\n# Calculate the angle moved in the first segment (5 degrees/hour for 10 hours)\nangle_first_segment = 5 * 10\n\n# Calculate the angle moved in the second segment (3 degrees/hour for 2 hours)\nangle_second_segment = 3 * 2\n\n# Total angle from the ground to the sun after movement\ntotal_angle = initial_angle + angle_first_segment + angle_second_segment\n\n# Using the print function as per the requirements\nprint(total_angle)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed, it will compute the total angle and display the result. Let's compute the total angle now."
