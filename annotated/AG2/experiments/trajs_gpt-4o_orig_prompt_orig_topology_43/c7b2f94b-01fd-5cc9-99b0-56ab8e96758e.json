      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll first understand the distribution of apples collected by Joanne and her sister and set up equations based on the problem description. Then we will solve these equations to find the required ratio.\n\nKey Idea:\nGiven the number of apples gathered by Joanne from trees of different heights, we need to express her sister's total collection in terms of Joanne's collection and find out how many times her sister's collection from the shortest trees is compared to Joanne's collection.\n\nLet's start:\n\n1. Define variables for the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.\n2. Write equations based on the gathered apple information.\n3. Solve for the required ratio.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. Let:\n   - \\( T_J = \\text{Joanne's apples from tallest trees} = 30 \\)\n   - \\( S_J = \\text{Joanne's apples from shortest trees} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\)\n   - \\( A_J = \\text{Joanne's apples from average trees} = 350 \\)\n\n   Total apples Joanne gathers:\n   \\[\n   T_J + S_J + A_J = 30 + 15 + 350 = 395\n   \\]\n\n2. Joanne's sister gathers:\n   - Twice as many apples from the tallest trees: \\( 2 \\times T_J = 60 \\)\n   - Let \\( S_S \\) be the apples her sister gathers from the shortest trees. (She doesn’t gather from average trees.)\n\n3. Total apples collected by both sisters:\n   \\[\n   T_J + S_J + A_J + (2 \\times T_J) + S_S = 500\n   \\]\n   Substitute known values:\n   \\[\n   395 + 60 + S_S = 500\n   \\]\n   Solve for \\( S_S \\):\n   \\[\n   S_S = 500 - 395 - 60 = 45\n   \\]\n\n4. Find how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of times} = \\frac{S_S}{S_J} = \\frac{45}{15} = 3\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate using Python to ensure we've covered all calculations correctly:\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nS_J, S_S = symbols('S_J S_S')\n\n# Joanne's apple counts\nT_J = 30\nS_J_value = T_J / 2\nA_J = 350\n\n# Sister's apples from tallest trees\nT_S_sister = 2 * T_J\n\n# Equation balancing total apples\ntotal_apples = 500\nequation = Eq(T_J + S_J_value + A_J + T_S_sister + S_S, total_apples)\n\n# Solve equation for S_S\nS_S_value = solve(equation, S_S)[0]\n\n# Determine the ratio\nratio = Rational(S_S_value, S_J_value)\n\nprint(f\"The number of times Joanne's sister gathered apples as compared to Joanne from the shortest trees is: {ratio}\")\n```\n\nThe ultimate answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
