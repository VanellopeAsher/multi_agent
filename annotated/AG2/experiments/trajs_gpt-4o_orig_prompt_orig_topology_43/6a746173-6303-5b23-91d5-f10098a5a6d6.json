You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

Here is the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of contributions from Walter's neighbors and the online fund.\n2. Add the contribution from his friend.\n3. Determine the total contribution from everyone except the lawyer.\n4. Multiply this total by 3 to find out how much the lawyer will contribute, since the lawyer donates three times as much as everyone else.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# We are using pure arithmetic operations since sympy is not necessary here.\n# Total from neighbors and the fund\nneighbors_and_fund = 300 + 1200\n\n# Friend's contribution\nfriend_contribution = 120\n\n# Total contribution from everyone except the lawyer\ntotal_contribution = neighbors_and_fund + friend_contribution\n\n# Lawyer contributes three times this amount\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * total_contribution\n\n# Print the lawyer's contribution\nprint(lawyer_contribution)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the contribution of Walter's lawyer."
