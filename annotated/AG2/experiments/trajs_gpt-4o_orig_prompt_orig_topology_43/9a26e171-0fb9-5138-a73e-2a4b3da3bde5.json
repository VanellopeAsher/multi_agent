You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home.

Let \\( x \\) represent the total number of students at that grade level.\n2. According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. Therefore, \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\) students have a desktop.\n3. The problem states that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{4}x = 20 \\).\n4. Further, these 20 students correspond to one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer.\n\nLet's start solving the problem step by step:\n\n1. Find the total number of students using the equation \\( \\frac{1}{4}x = 20 \\).\n2. Determine how many students do not have either a desktop or a laptop using the given information.\n\nLet's resolve these steps with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation 1: 1/4 of the students do not have a desktop\nequation1 = Eq(x/4, 20)\n\n# Solve for the total number of students\ntotal_students = solve(equation1, x)[0]\n\n# Since 20 represents one-third of students without either type of computer:\n# Let y represent the total number of students without either type of computer\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Equation 2: 20 = 1/3 of students without either type of computer\nequation2 = Eq(20, y/3)\n\n# Solve for the number of students without either type of computer\nstudents_without_either = solve(equation2, y)[0]\n\n# Print results\nprint(f'Total number of students: {total_students}')\nprint(f'Number of students without either type of computer: {students_without_either}')\n```\n\nOnce the above code is run, we'll have the total number of students at that grade level.
