You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJake is shopping at a clothing store.

Finally, we'll sum these two amounts to get the total amount Jake spends.\n\nKey idea: \nWe'll use Python to perform the calculations because the problem requires both arithmetic operations and the application of percentage discounts.\n\n1. **T-shirt Calculation**:\n   - The original price of each T-shirt is $80.\n   - Jake buys 20 T-shirts.\n   - The store offers a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means for every two T-shirts, Jake pays 100% for the first one and 50% for the second one.\n\n2. **Shoes Calculation**:\n   - The original price of the shoes is $400.\n   - There's a 40% discount applied to the shoes.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the total cost:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Prices and discounts\ntshirt_price = 80\nnum_tshirts = 20\nshoes_original_price = 400\nshoes_discount = Fraction(40, 100)  # 40% discount\n\n# Calculate total cost of T-shirts\nnum_pairs = num_tshirts // 2  # 20 T-shirts can be paired into 10 pairs\ntshirt_pair_price = tshirt_price + (tshirt_price * Fraction(50, 100))  # Buy one get one 50% off\ntshirt_total_cost = num_pairs * tshirt_pair_price\n\n# Calculate total cost of shoes\nshoes_discounted_price = shoes_original_price * (1 - shoes_discount)\n\n# Total amount spent\ntotal_cost = tshirt_total_cost + shoes_discounted_price\n\nprint(\"Total amount Jake spends at the store: $\", total_cost)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total amount Jake spends at the store.
