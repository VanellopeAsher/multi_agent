You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home.

We know that two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer, and 30 students do not have one. That means one-third of the students do not have a desktop computer. \n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the total number of students. Based on the problem, one-third of \\( x \\) equals 30. We can solve this equation to find the total number of students.\n\nLet's write a Python program using sympy to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation: one-third of the students do not have desktop computers\nequation = Eq(x / 3, 30)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_students = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result ensuring it's in integer form\nprint(int(total_students))\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of students at that grade level."
