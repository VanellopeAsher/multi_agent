You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are 80 deer in a field.  30 percent of them are bucks.  50 percent of the bucks are 6 points.

Calculate the number of bucks by taking 30 percent of the total deer.\n2. Find the number of 6-point bucks by taking 50 percent of the number of bucks.\n\nThis can be solved using Python as follows:\n\n```python\n# Total number of deer\ntotal_deer = 80\n\n# Percentage of bucks\npercentage_of_bucks = 30 / 100\n\n# Bucks in the field\nbucks = total_deer * percentage_of_bucks\n\n# Percentage of 6-point bucks\npercentage_of_6_point_bucks = 50 / 100\n\n# 6-point bucks\nsix_point_bucks = bucks * percentage_of_6_point_bucks\n\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Print the result as a fraction (if needed) or directly in integer\nprint(Rational(six_point_bucks))\n```\n\nRunning this code will yield the number of 6-point bucks. The use of `Rational` here ensures that if there were any non-integer results, we would provide them in fraction form. In this particular calculation, we expect a whole number since we're dealing with a real-world count of items (deer). The answer is then \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
