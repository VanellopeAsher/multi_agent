She purchased 20 tomato seed packets and 80 celery seed packets for this purpose. Given that a tomato seed packet is priced at $40 and a celery seed packet is priced at $30, what is the total amount of money she spent on purchasing the seeds?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables.

Calculate the total cost for the tomato seed packets.\n2. Calculate the total cost for the celery seed packets.\n3. Add these two amounts to get the total expenditure.\n\nThis can be solved directly using Python. Here's the code:\n\n```python\n# Prices and quantities\ntomato_packet_price = 40  # price in dollars\ncelery_packet_price = 30  # price in dollars\ntomato_packets = 20\ncelery_packets = 80\n\n# Total cost calculations\ntotal_tomato_cost = tomato_packets * tomato_packet_price\ntotal_celery_cost = celery_packets * celery_packet_price\ntotal_cost = total_tomato_cost + total_celery_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will compute the total amount of money spent by Mrs. Rylan on the seed packets.
