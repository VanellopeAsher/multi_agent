You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

We can solve this problem using basic arithmetic.\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem:**\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people invited:\n   - 12 families with 6 people each.\n   - 15 families with 4 people each.\n\n2. Calculate the number of people who couldn't come due to illness.\n\n3. Calculate the number of people who couldn't come because of previous commitments, which is 1/4 of those who were ill.\n\n4. Subtract the number of people who couldn't attend (due to both illness and previous commitments) from the total number of invited people to find out how many people show up.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total number of people invited\nfamilies_6_people = 12\nfamilies_4_people = 15\n\npeople_from_6_people_families = families_6_people * 6\npeople_from_4_people_families = families_4_people * 4\n\ntotal_invited = people_from_6_people_families + people_from_4_people_families\n\n# People who couldn't attend due to illness\nill_people = 16\n\n# People who had previous commitments\ncommitments_people = ill_people * Rational(1, 4)\n\n# Total absent people\ntotal_absent = ill_people + commitments_people\n\n# Calculate number of people who show up\npeople_show_up = total_invited - total_absent\n\n# Output the result\nprint(people_show_up)\n```\n\nBy running this code with the sympy library, we ensure that the fractions are handled correctly and output is given in exact form."
