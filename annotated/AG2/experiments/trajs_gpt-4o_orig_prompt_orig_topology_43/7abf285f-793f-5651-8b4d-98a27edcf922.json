  "problem": "Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts and continues to pay the regular amount for her gym and Netflix, how much does she pay for her debts in a year?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate Jessica's monthly and annual debt payments while considering the additional 50% she wants to pay over the minimum amount. We can use Python for these calculations.\n\nHere is the thought process:\n\n1. Calculate 50% more than the minimum monthly payment for each debt.\n2. Find the total monthly payment for all debts.\n3. Calculate the annual payment based on the monthly payment.\n4. Exclude any non-debt payments from the debt total (like Netflix).\n\nThis problem can be solved directly using Python code. Let's write the program:\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy for exact arithmetic operations with fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define minimum payments and the extra percentage\nstudent_loan_min = 300\ncredit_card_min = 200\nmortgage_min = 500\nextra_percentage = Rational(50, 100)  # 50% as a fraction\n\n# Calculate the total amount paid on each debt after including the extra 50%\nstudent_loan_payment = student_loan_min * (1 + extra_percentage)\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min * (1 + extra_percentage)\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min * (1 + extra_percentage)\n\n# Calculate total monthly and yearly payments for debts\nmonthly_debt_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate annual debt payment (12 months in a year)\nannual_debt_payment = monthly_debt_payment * 12\n\n# Output the result\nprint(annual_debt_payment)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year, considering she pays 50% more than the minimum on each debt. The result is printed using fractions rather than decimal numbers to maintain precision."
