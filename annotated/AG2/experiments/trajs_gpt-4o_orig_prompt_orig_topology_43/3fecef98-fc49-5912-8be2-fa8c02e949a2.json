You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed.

Compute the dimensions of the comforter. Since it's 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, add 2 feet to each dimension of the bed.\n2. Calculate the area of the comforter using the dimensions found in step 1.\n3. Calculate the area of the duvet cover.\n4. Add the two areas together to find the total fabric needed.\n\nLet's write Python code to calculate these areas and get the total fabric required.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Dimensions of the bed\nlength_bed = 6\nwidth_bed = 8\n\n# Dimensions of the comforter\nlength_comforter = length_bed + 2\nwidth_comforter = width_bed + 2\n\n# Area of the comforter\narea_comforter = length_comforter * width_comforter\n\n# Dimensions of the duvet cover\nlength_duvet = 9\nwidth_duvet = 11\n\n# Area of the duvet cover\narea_duvet = length_duvet * width_duvet\n\n# Total fabric needed\ntotal_fabric = area_comforter + area_duvet\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_fabric)\n```\n\nRunning this code will provide the total amount of fabric Jim needs in square feet. Let's proceed to find the total area."
