  "problem": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll first determine how many sports cards Miss Maria has in total. Then we'll calculate how many cards remain after she keeps 50 cards. Finally, we'll figure out how many students there are by dividing the remaining number of cards equally among them, with each student receiving 10 cards.\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step, and since it involves straightforward calculations, we'll write a Python code to solve it directly.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has.\n3. Calculate the total number of all sports cards Miss Maria has.\n4. Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps from the total.\n5. Calculate how many students there are by dividing the remaining number of cards by the number of cards each student receives.\n\nNow, letâ€™s write the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n\n# Number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n\n# Total number of cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\n\n# Cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_for_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Each student gets 10 cards\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Calculate the number of students\nnumber_of_students = cards_for_students // cards_per_student\n\n# Print the number of students\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\nOnce you run the code above, you'll get the number of students as the output. Let's compute this."
