You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.

Add up the articles published by both companies for each day and multiply by the number of days.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of articles published daily by each company\npolitical_and_weather_daily = 20\nbusiness_daily = 10\n\n# Total number of articles published daily by both companies\ntotal_daily = political_and_weather_daily + business_daily\n\n# Number of days in February in a standard non-leap year\ndays_in_february = 2.8 * 10\n\n# Calculate the total number of articles published in February\ntotal_articles_february = total_daily * days_in_february\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_articles_february)\n```\n\nLet me know if you would like me to run this code and provide the answer."
