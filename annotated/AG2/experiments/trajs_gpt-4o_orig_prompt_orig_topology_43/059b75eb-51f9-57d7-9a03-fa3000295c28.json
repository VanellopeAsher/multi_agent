Following a day of intense rainfall, the water volume at the same location in the river becomes twice as much. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow at that point. What is the total volume of water flowing through that point of the river on the third day?",

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain moment, a river is flowing with a volume of 4000 gallons of water.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we can use straightforward arithmetic calculations. The key idea is to track the changes in the volume of the river flow across each day as described. This can be directly handled using Python.\n\nKey steps:\n1. Start with an initial volume of 4000 gallons.\n2. After the first day of intense rainfall, the volume doubles.\n3. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons is added to this doubled volume.\n\nLet's write a Python code snippet to compute the final volume on the third day:\n\n```python\n# Initial volume of the river\ninitial_volume = 4000\n\n# Volume after the first day (it doubles)\nvolume_day_2 = initial_volume * 2\n\n# Volume on the third day after adding additional 6000 gallons\nfinal_volume_day_3 = volume_day_2 + 6000\n\n# Print the final volume in fractions/radical forms instead of decimals\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(Rational(final_volume_day_3))\n```\n\nWhen we run this code, it will compute the total volume of water flowing through the point in the river on the third day. The code uses the `Rational` class from sympy to maintain the volume as an exact fraction, although in this straightforward case, the answer is a whole number.\n\nLet's calculate it."
