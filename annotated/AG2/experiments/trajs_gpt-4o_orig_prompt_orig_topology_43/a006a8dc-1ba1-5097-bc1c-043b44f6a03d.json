You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the number of kids:** \n   There are 20 kids divided equally into two groups: boys and girls.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Seashells brought by the boys:**\n   Each boy brings back 60 shells.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells brought by boys} = 10 \\times 60 = 600\n   \\]\n\n3. **Seashells brought by the girls:**\n   According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys.\n   \n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of shells each girl brought. Then:\n   \\[\n   10x = 600 + 4.5 \\times 600\n   \\]\n\nLet's move to solve this equation using Python to find how many seashells each girl brought back.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total shells brought by boys\nboys_shells = 600\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(10 * x, boys_shells + 4.5 * boys_shells)\n\n# Solve for x\nseashells_per_girl = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the number of seashells each girl brought\nprint(seashells_per_girl)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we will find out how many seashells each girl brought."
