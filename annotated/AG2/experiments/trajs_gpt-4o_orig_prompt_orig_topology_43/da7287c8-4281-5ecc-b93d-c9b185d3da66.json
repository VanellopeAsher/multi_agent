You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTerry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, nine burger platters for $11.5 each, and half of 40 sodas for $1.50 each.

Calculate the total revenue from burger platters.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from sodas.\n4. Sum these revenues to find the total revenue.\n\nLet's write a Python program to do these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices and quantities\nmilkshake_price = Rational(550, 100)  # $5.50\nburger_platter_price = Rational(1150, 100)  # $11.50\nsoda_price = Rational(150, 100)  # $1.50\n\nmilkshake_quantity = 6\nburger_platter_quantity = 9\nsoda_quantity = Rational(40, 2)  # half of 40\n\n# Calculate total revenue for each item\ntotal_milkshake_revenue = milkshake_price * milkshake_quantity\ntotal_burger_platter_revenue = burger_platter_price * burger_platter_quantity\ntotal_soda_revenue = soda_price * soda_quantity\n\n# Total revenue\ntotal_revenue = total_milkshake_revenue + total_burger_platter_revenue + total_soda_revenue\n\n# Print the total revenue\nprint(total_revenue)\n```\n\nRunning this program will give the total revenue in a fraction form, which is the requirement.
