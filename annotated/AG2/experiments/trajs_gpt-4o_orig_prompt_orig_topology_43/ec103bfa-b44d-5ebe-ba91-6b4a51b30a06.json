You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

Then we'll determine how much Marie spent on pizza and use that to find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered.\n\nHere is how we can solve it in Python:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the chicken meal.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the milk.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the apples.\n4. Subtract the sum of these costs from the total amount Marie paid to find the total cost of the pizzas.\n5. Divide the total cost of the pizzas by the price per box to determine how many boxes of pizza were ordered.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Prices and quantities\nchicken_cost = 120\nmilk_pack_cost = 30\nmilk_packs = 5\napple_cost = 1.5\napples = 40\npizza_box_cost = 57\n\n# Total amount paid\ntotal_paid = 900\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_chicken_cost = chicken_cost\ntotal_milk_cost = milk_pack_cost * milk_packs\ntotal_apple_cost = apple_cost * apples\n\n# Remaining amount after buying chicken, milk, and apples\nremaining_for_pizza = total_paid - (total_chicken_cost + total_milk_cost + total_apple_cost)\n\n# Solve for number of pizza boxes\nnumber_of_pizza_boxes = symbols('x')\nequation = Eq(pizza_box_cost * number_of_pizza_boxes, remaining_for_pizza)\n\n# Solve the equation\npizza_boxes_solution = solve(equation, number_of_pizza_boxes)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(pizza_boxes_solution[0])\n```\n\nRunning this code will give the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered."
