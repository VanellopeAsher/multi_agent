You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in years?"

Let's denote the son's age as \\( x \\).\n\nThe key equation from the problem's description is:\n\\[ 60 = 2x - 8 \\]\n\nWe will solve this equation for \\( x \\) to find the son's age.\n\nKey idea: This is a straightforward algebra problem, so we can solve it directly using Python.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve the equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# The equation based on the problem description\nequation = Eq(2*x - 8, 60)\n\n# Solve the equation\nson_age = solve(equation, x)[0]\nprint(son_age)\n```\n\nRun this code to find the age of Carver's son."
