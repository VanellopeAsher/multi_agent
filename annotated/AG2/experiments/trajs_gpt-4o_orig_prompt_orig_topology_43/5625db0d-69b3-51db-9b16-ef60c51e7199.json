You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.

Calculate the total price Clara paid.\n   - Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.\n   - She had a $3 discount at the checkout.\n\n2. Calculate the total price Sheila paid.\n   - Sheila bought 15 apples at $25 each.\n   - The store offered a 15% discount on the total cost before the discount.\n\n3. Determine the difference between the two amounts.\n\nLet's start with the calculations in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Clara's purchase\nprice_per_apple_clara = 15\nnumber_of_apples_clara = 15\ntotal_clara = number_of_apples_clara * price_per_apple_clara\ndiscount_clara = 3\nfinal_price_clara = total_clara - discount_clara\n\n# Sheila's purchase\nprice_per_apple_sheila = 25\nnumber_of_apples_sheila = 15\ntotal_sheila = number_of_apples_sheila * price_per_apple_sheila\ndiscount_sheila = Rational(15, 100) * total_sheila  # 15% discount\nfinal_price_sheila = total_sheila - discount_sheila\n\n# Difference in prices\ndifference = final_price_sheila - final_price_clara\n\n# Print the difference\nprint('Difference between the final prices:', difference)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the difference in the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila.
