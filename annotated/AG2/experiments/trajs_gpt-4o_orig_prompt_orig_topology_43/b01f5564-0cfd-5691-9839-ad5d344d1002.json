You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

Determine the ratio of protein to grams of mushrooms.\n2. Calculate the daily protein intake based on John's daily mushroom consumption.\n3. Compute the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily intake by 7 days.\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the variables for the problem.\nweight_per_cup = 150  # grams\nprotein_per_cup = 4   # grams of protein\ndaily_consumption = 300  # grams\n\n# Calculate protein per gram.\nprotein_per_gram = protein_per_cup / weight_per_cup\n\n# Calculate daily protein intake.\ndaily_protein_intake = protein_per_gram * daily_consumption\n\n# Calculate weekly protein intake.\nweekly_protein_intake = daily_protein_intake * 7\n\n# Print the result.\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give Johnâ€™s weekly protein intake in grams."
