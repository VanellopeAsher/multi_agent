You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels.

Since the problem involves simple arithmetic, it falls under Case 1, where we can solve it directly using Python.\n\nThe average height of the heels can be calculated by finding the total height of all the heels worn and then dividing by the number of women.\n\nHere's the step-by-step outline:\n\n1. Calculate the total height of the heels worn by all the women.\n2. Divide this total height by the number of women to find the average height.\n\nWe'll use Python to calculate the average height:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Number of women wearing each type of heel\nnum_women_4_5_inch = 3\nnum_women_2_5_inch = 3\n\n# Heights of the heels\nheight_4_5_inch = 4.5\nheight_2_5_inch = 2.5\n\n# Total height calculation\ntotal_height = (num_women_4_5_inch * height_4_5_inch) + (num_women_2_5_inch * height_2_5_inch)\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = num_women_4_5_inch + num_women_2_5_inch\n\n# Average height\naverage_height = Fraction(total_height, total_women)\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nNow, I'll calculate the result using the above code."

When we use floating point numbers (like `4.5` or `2.5`), it can lead to this type error.\n\nTo fix this, let's convert the heel heights into fractions directly so that both the numerator and denominator are rational numbers. Here's how the corrected code looks:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Number of women wearing each type of heel\nnum_women_4_5_inch = 3\nnum_women_2_5_inch = 3\n\n# Heights of the heels as Fractions instead of floats\nheight_4_5_inch = Fraction(9, 2)  # 4.5 is 9/2\nheight_2_5_inch = Fraction(5, 2)  # 2.5 is 5/2\n\n# Total height calculation\ntotal_height = (num_women_4_5_inch * height_4_5_inch) + (num_women_2_5_inch * height_2_5_inch)\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = num_women_4_5_inch + num_women_2_5_inch\n\n# Average height as a Fraction\naverage_height = total_height / total_women\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the result with these corrections."
