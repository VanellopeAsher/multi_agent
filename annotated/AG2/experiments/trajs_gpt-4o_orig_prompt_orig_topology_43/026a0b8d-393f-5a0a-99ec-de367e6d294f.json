  "problem": "It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

We'll use Python to calculate the solution.\n\nKey Idea: Set up equations based on the cost and number of seed packets, then solve for the unknown.\n- Let \\( t \\) be the number of tomato seed packets.\n- We know the price per tomato packet is $40, and she spent a total of $3200 on seeds.\n- The total number of celery packets is given as 80, and each costs $30.\n\nWe can write the following equations:\n1. Total cost equation: \\( 40t + 30 \\times 80 = 3200 \\)\n\nSolving the above equation will give the number of tomato seed packets.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nt = symbols('t')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(40 * t + 30 * 80, 3200)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, t)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\nRun this code to find out how many packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought."
