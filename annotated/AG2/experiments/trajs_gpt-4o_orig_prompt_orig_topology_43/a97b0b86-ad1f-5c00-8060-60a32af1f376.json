You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples.\n2. Subtract this sum from the total amount Marie paid to determine how much she spent on pizzas.\n3. Divide this remaining amount by the cost per box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered.\n\nWe'll use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the price of each item\nchicken_meal_cost = 12\nmilk_cost_per_pack = 3.5\napples_cost_per_apple = 1.5\npizza_cost_per_box = 8.5\n\n# Define the quantities ordered\nmilk_quantity = 5\napples_quantity = 4\n\n# Calculate the total cost for chicken, milk, and apples\ntotal_chicken_cost = chicken_meal_cost\ntotal_milk_cost = milk_cost_per_pack * milk_quantity\ntotal_apples_cost = apples_cost_per_apple * apples_quantity\n\n# Total cost excluding pizzas\ntotal_cost_excluding_pizzas = total_chicken_cost + total_milk_cost + total_apples_cost\n\n# Total amount paid by Marie\ntotal_paid = 52.5\n\n# Remaining amount is the cost for pizzas\npizza_cost_total = total_paid - total_cost_excluding_pizzas\n\n# Define a symbol for the number of pizza boxes\nnumber_of_pizza_boxes = symbols('number_of_pizza_boxes')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(pizza_cost_per_box * number_of_pizza_boxes, pizza_cost_total)\n\n# Solve for the number of pizza boxes\npizza_boxes_ordered = solve(equation, number_of_pizza_boxes)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f'Marie ordered {pizza_boxes_ordered} boxes of pizza.')\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered.
