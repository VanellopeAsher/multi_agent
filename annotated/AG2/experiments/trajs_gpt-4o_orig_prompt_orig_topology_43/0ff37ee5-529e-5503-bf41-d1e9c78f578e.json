You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

Let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: \n    - Let \\( x \\) be the number of $10 bills Ali has.\n    - The total money from the $10 bills is \\( 10x \\).\n    - He also has six $20 bills, which amount to \\( 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Initial Total Money**: \n    - The total money Ali has is \\( 10x + 120 \\).\n\n3. **Distribute Money**: \n    - Ali gives half of this to his sister, so he has \\( \\frac{1}{2}(10x + 120) \\) left.\n\n4. **Spending for Dinner**: \n    - He uses \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the remaining money for dinner.\n    - The money spent on dinner is \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2}(10x + 120)\\).\n    - The amount left after buying dinner is $32.\n\n5. **Set Up Equation**: \n    - The equation of the money left is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{1}{2}(10x + 120) - \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2}(10x + 120) = 32\n      \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve for \\( x \\) using the sympy library.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the remaining balance after dinner\ntotal_money = 10 * x + 120\nremaining_after_sister = total_money / 2\nmoney_spent_on_dinner = (3/5) * remaining_after_sister\nafter_dinner_amount = remaining_after_sister - money_spent_on_dinner\n\n# Equation: after_dinner_amount = 32\nequation = Eq(after_dinner_amount, 32)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, the solution to the problem (the number of $10 bills Ali originally had) will be displayed.
