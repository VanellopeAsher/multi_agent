You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag.

Determine the selling price per bag.\n3. Use the profit information to set up an equation and solve for the number of bags.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Cost price per bag\ncost_price_per_bag = 20 + 2  # buying cost plus transportation cost\n\n# Selling price per bag\nselling_price_per_bag = 30\n\n# Profit per bag\nprofit_per_bag = selling_price_per_bag - cost_price_per_bag\n\n# Total profit\ntotal_profit = 400\n\n# Define variable for the number of bags\nn = symbols('n', integer=True)\n\n# Equation for total profit\nequation = Eq(profit_per_bag * n, total_profit)\n\n# Solve the equation to find the number of bags\nbags_sold = solve(equation, n)\n\nprint(bags_sold[0])\n```\n\nThis code calculates the number of bags the trader sold to make a profit of $400 after including the cost and transportation fees in his calculations.
