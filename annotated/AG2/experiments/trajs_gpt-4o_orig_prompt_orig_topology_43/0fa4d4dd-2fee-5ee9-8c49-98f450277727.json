  "problem": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.\n2. Calculate Sara's total earnings from babysitting.\n3. Determine how much more money she needs by subtracting her savings and babysitting earnings from the total cost.\n4. Calculate the number of times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount.\n\nNow let's use Python to compute this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the costs\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost_per_pair = 100\nnum_pairs_of_shoes = 2\n\n# Total cost of the jacket and shoes\ntotal_cost = jacket_cost + (shoe_cost_per_pair * num_pairs_of_shoes)\n\n# Earnings from babysitting\nbabysitting_sessions = 10\nearnings_per_babysit = 5\ntotal_babysitting_earnings = babysitting_sessions * earnings_per_babysit\n\n# Sara's initial savings\ninitial_savings = 100\n\n# Money still needed\nmoney_needed = total_cost - (initial_savings + total_babysitting_earnings)\n\n# Earnings from mowing the lawn\nearnings_per_mow = 10\n\n# Define the variable for times Sara needs to mow the lawn\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for the amount needed from mowing\nequation = Eq(x * earnings_per_mow, money_needed)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\ntimes_to_mow = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the number of times she needs to mow the lawn\nprint(times_to_mow)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes.
