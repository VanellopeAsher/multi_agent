You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow Case 1 because it involves straightforward calculations that can be done directly with Python.\n\nKey idea: We need to find the total number of unicorns in Scotland first, and then determine the total number worldwide.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) represent the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n2. According to the problem, two-thirds of these unicorns are female. Thus, \\( \\frac{2}{3}x = 6 \\).\n3. Solve for \\( x \\) to find the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n4. Since a third of all unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, it implies that all unicorns in Scotland are a third of the total number worldwide. So, \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ of total unicorns worldwide} = x \\).\n5. Calculate the total number worldwide.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# x is the total number of unicorns in Scotland\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Two-thirds of unicorns in Scotland are female, and there are 6 female unicorns\nequation1 = Eq((2/3) * x, 6)\n\n# Solve for x\ntotal_scottish_unicorns = solve(equation1, x)[0]\n\n# If a third of the total unicorns are in Scotland, total unicorns worldwide = 3 * total in Scotland\ntotal_unicorns_worldwide = 3 * total_scottish_unicorns\n\n# The number of unicorns left in the world (excluding those in Scotland)\nunicorns_left_worldwide = total_unicorns_worldwide - total_scottish_unicorns\n\nprint(unicorns_left_worldwide)\n```\n\nRun this code to find out how many unicorns are left in the world."

Now, to express the answer appropriately:\n\nThe total number of unicorns in Scotland is calculated as \\( x = 9 \\) (since there are 6 female unicorns, which is two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland).\n\nThe total number of unicorns worldwide is \\( 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of unicorns left in the world (excluding those in Scotland, which are 9) is \\( 27 - 9 = 18 \\).\n\nSo, the number of unicorns left in the world is \\(\\boxed{18}\\)."
