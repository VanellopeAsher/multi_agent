      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine Mark's initial weight before he started losing weight. We know that he lost weight at a consistent rate and eventually weighed 70 pounds. \n\nKey Idea:\nSince the problem can be solved using basic arithmetic operations, it falls under Case 1. We can create a simple equation to find the initial weight using Python.\n\nMark's weight loss can be described with the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial Weight} = \\text{Final Weight} + (\\text{Weight Loss per Month} \\times \\text{Number of Months}) \\]\n\nSince we don't have the number of months provided, we'll assume that Mark's weight loss continued until he reached his final weight of 70 pounds, starting from some initial weight.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve for the initial weight:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let x be the initial weight\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation: Final weight (70 lbs) = Initial weight - 10 * number of months\n# We assume for solving: number of months = (Initial weight - Final weight) / 10\nfinal_weight = 70\nweight_loss_per_month = 10\nmonths = symbols('months')\n\n# Weight equation\nequation = Eq(x - months * weight_loss_per_month, final_weight)\n\n# Now solve for the initial weight in terms of months\nsolution = solve(equation.subs(months, (x - final_weight) / weight_loss_per_month), x)\n\n# Printing the initial weight\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nRunning this code will yield Mark's initial weight before he started losing weight. Since we assume that the entire weight loss journey brought him from his initial weight to 70 pounds (with a constant rate of weight loss), this will compute correctly given the conditions."

Let's simplify the problem.\n\nSince Mark's final weight is 70 pounds and we know the rate of weight loss is 10 pounds per month, we can find his initial weight as follows:\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( x \\) as his initial weight.\n\nSince there was no mention of how many months he was unwell, the weight lost will just be the difference:\n\n\\[ \\text{Weight Lost} = \\text{Initial Weight} - \\text{Final Weight} = 10 \\times \\text{Number of Months} \\]\n\nIf we denote the time period he lost weight by \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ x = 70 + 10m \\]\n\nSince the number of months wasn't specified, we simply need an expression for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( m \\).\n\nIf we assume Mark was losing weight continuously and reached 70 pounds after losing a certain amount of weight, we can write the Python code to compute the initial weight directly for any specified number of months:\n\n```python\n# Let's manually derive it for one scenario\n# Assume he lost weight over a period of 3 months, for instance\n\nprint(70 + 10 * 3)  # Example with 3 months lost\n```\n\nFor any actual scenario, you would need the specific number of months \\( m \\) to calculate \\( x \\).
