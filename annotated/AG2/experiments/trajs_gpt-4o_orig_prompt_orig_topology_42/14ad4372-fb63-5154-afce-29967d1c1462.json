She charges $15.00 per student for each class. Additionally, she offers a free 5-minute warm-up session before each class, which doesn't affect her earnings. How much money does she make in 1 week?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday.

Calculate her earnings on Saturday.\n3. Sum the earnings to find the total weekly income.\n\nSince the problem provides fixed numbers of classes and students per class, we can use Python to automate these calculations easily.\n\n```python\n# Calculate earnings from Monday to Friday\nclasses_per_day_weekday = 5\nstudents_per_class = 15\nprice_per_student = 15\nweekdays = 5\n\n# Calculate earnings for weekday classes\nweekday_earnings = classes_per_day_weekday * students_per_class * price_per_student * weekdays\n\n# Calculate earnings for Saturday classes\nclasses_on_saturday = 8\nsaturday_earnings = classes_on_saturday * students_per_class * price_per_student\n\n# Calculate total earnings for the week\ntotal_weekly_earnings = weekday_earnings + saturday_earnings\n\nprint(total_weekly_earnings)\n```\n\nThe code calculates total weekly earnings and outputs it using the `print` function.
