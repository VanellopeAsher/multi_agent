  "problem": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation and make use of Python to perform any necessary calculations.\n\nKey Idea:\nPolly can throw the gold javelin normally for 4000 feet. When holding the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance triples, allowing her to throw up to \\( 3 \\times 4000 \\) feet, which is 12000 feet.\n\nThe dragon's flames reach up to 10000 feet. We want to determine how far Polly can stand outside the dragon's flame reach and still hit the dragon with the javelin when holding the gemstone.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Calculate the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.\n2. Determine how far outside the 10000-foot range this maximum throw distance allows Polly to be.\n\nLet's do these calculations in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate maximum throw distance with gemstone\nregular_throw_distance = 4000  # In feet\nwith_gemstone_distance = 3 * regular_throw_distance\n\n# Dragon's flame reach\ndragon_reach = 10000\n\n# Calculate how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand\ndistance_outside_flame_range = with_gemstone_distance - dragon_reach\n\nprint(distance_outside_flame_range)  # This will display the result\n```\n\nRunning this code will determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand. Evaluating the expression:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance Polly can stand outside the flame range} = 12000 - 10000 = 2000 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nHence, Polly can stand \\(\\boxed{2000}\\) feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames."
