You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Monday, a water tank measured 17 feet deep.

Start with the water level on Monday, which is 17 feet.\n2. On Tuesday, the water level rises by 7 feet, so we add this to Monday's level.\n3. On Wednesday, the water level decreases to two-thirds of Tuesday's depth. Calculate this value.\n\nWe can use Python to easily calculate the final depth on Wednesday.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial depth on Monday\nmonday_depth = 17\n\n# Increase on Tuesday\nincrease = 7\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + increase\n\n# Wednesday's depth is two-thirds of Tuesday's\nwednesday_depth = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_depth\n\n# Print the depth on Wednesday\nprint(wednesday_depth)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday in fractional form."
