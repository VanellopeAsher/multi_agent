You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

Then, we'll determine how much Walter's lawyer will donate, given that he offers to contribute three times this total amount.\n\n### Solution Steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total contributions from neighbors, online fund, and Walter's friend:**\n   - Neighbors: $300\n   - Online fund: $1200\n   - Friend: $120\n\n2. **Sum these contributions** to get the total donation amount that Walter is going to report to his lawyer.\n\n3. **Calculate the lawyer's contribution** as three times the reported total donation amount.\n\nWe can solve this straightforwardly using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total amount donated by neighbors, online fund, and friend\nneighbors = 300\nonline_fund = 1200\nfriend = 120\n\n# Total amount collected\ntotal_collected = neighbors + online_fund + friend\n\n# Lawyer's contribution is three times the total collected amount\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * total_collected\n\nprint(lawyer_contribution)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the lawyer's contribution.
