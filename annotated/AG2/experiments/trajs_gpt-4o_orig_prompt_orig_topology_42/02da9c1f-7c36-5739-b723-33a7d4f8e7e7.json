You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the task involves distributing ribbons equally for making bows for the gifts.\n\nKey Idea:\n- The problem involves simple division to find out how many inches of ribbon should be used for each gift bow.\n- Monica has gifts for three groups: family, friends, and teachers. We need to find the total number of gifts and then divide the ribbon length by this total.\n\nSince the problem is straightforward and can be handled directly with Python (Case 1), let's write a program to calculate the number of inches of ribbon per gift bow.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of gifts and then decide how many inches Monica can use for each bow. We need the length of ribbon available, as long as it's provided or assumed.\n\nLet's assume Monica has a total length of ribbon available. For the sake of this solution, I will assume she has 120 inches of ribbon to divide equally among all gifts.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic operations if needed\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of gifts\ngifts_for_family = 6\ngifts_for_friends = 4\ngifts_for_teachers = 2\n\n# Total gifts\ntotal_gifts = gifts_for_family + gifts_for_friends + gifts_for_teachers\n\n# Assume Monica has 120 inches of ribbon in total\ntotal_ribbon_length = 120\n\n# Calculate inches of ribbon per gift bow\ninches_per_bow = Rational(total_ribbon_length, total_gifts)\n\n# Display the result in a fraction\nprint(inches_per_bow)\n```\n\nThis code would output the number of inches of ribbon that Monica can use for each gift bow in fractional form. If the exact total ribbon length is different, adjust `total_ribbon_length` accordingly."
