You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark has $50.5 in his bank account.

This can be solved directly using Python by setting up an equation and solving for the number of days needed. Here's how to set it up:\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of days \\( d \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n50.5 + 12.5 \\times d \\geq 300.5\n\\]\n\nThis is a straightforward algebraic problem that we can solve programmatically. Let's write a Python script to find the number of days \\( d \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the number of days\nd = symbols('d')\n\n# Solve the inequality for d\nsolution = solve(50.5 + 12.5 * d - 300.5, d)\n\n# Since `d` must be at least as large as the smallest integer solution,\n# we take the ceiling of the computed days.\ndays_needed = solution[0].ceil()\n\n# Print the result\nprint(days_needed)\n```\n\nThis will compute and print the number of days Mark needs to save to afford the bike. Let's execute the code to get the result."
