You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

We'll account for the additional hours he works on Fridays as well.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total hours Tim works each weekday except Friday.\n2. Calculate the total hours Tim works on Friday (including the additional hours).\n3. Sum up all the hours worked in the week.\n4. Convert total hours into total minutes.\n5. Divide total minutes by the time it takes to handle one call (15 minutes) to get the total number of calls.\n\nLet's write a Python program to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Constants\nminutes_per_hour = 60\nminutes_per_call = 15\nhours_per_day = 6\nadditional_friday_hours = 2\ndays_in_week_except_friday = 4\n\n# Calculate hours worked for Monday to Thursday\nweekly_hours_except_friday = days_in_week_except_friday * hours_per_day\n\n# Calculate hours worked on Friday\nfriday_hours = hours_per_day + additional_friday_hours\n\n# Total weekly hours\ntotal_weekly_hours = weekly_hours_except_friday + friday_hours\n\n# Convert total hours to total minutes\ntotal_weekly_minutes = total_weekly_hours * minutes_per_hour\n\n# Calculate total number of calls\ntotal_calls = total_weekly_minutes // minutes_per_call\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_calls)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with during his work week. Let me know if you want me to run through the calculation details further or have any questions about the approach."
