You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows.

Divide the total ribbon length by the total number of presents to get the length of ribbon per present.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\n# total number of presents\npresents_family = 6\npresents_buddies = 4\npresents_educators = 2\ntotal_presents = presents_family + presents_buddies + presents_educators\n\n# total ribbon available\ntotal_ribbon = 144  # in inches\n\n# length of ribbon per present\nribbon_per_present = total_ribbon / total_presents\n\n# Using the 'print' function to output the result\nprint(ribbon_per_present)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the length of ribbon available for each present's bow."
