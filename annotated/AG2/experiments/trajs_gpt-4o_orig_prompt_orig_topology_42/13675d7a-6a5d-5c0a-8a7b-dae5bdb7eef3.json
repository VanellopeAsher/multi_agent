You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

Here's how we should approach the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of wheels needed to assemble all the cars.\n2. Calculate the total number of wheels needed to assemble all the motorcycles.\n3. Add these two amounts to get the total number of wheels required.\n4. Use the information that 276 wheels remain after assembling all toys to determine the initial number of wheels in the box.\n\nSince we can directly calculate the required number of wheels with Python, we'll use Case 1 here.\n\nLet's write a Python program to find the total number of wheels in the box initially.\n\n```python\n# Number of cars and motorcycles\ncars = 57\nmotorcycles = 73\n\n# Wheels needed per car and per motorcycle\nwheels_per_car = 4\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\n\n# Calculate total wheels required\ntotal_wheels_for_cars = cars * wheels_per_car\ntotal_wheels_for_motorcycles = motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle\ntotal_wheels_required = total_wheels_for_cars + total_wheels_for_motorcycles\n\n# Given the remaining wheels in the box\nremaining_wheels = 276\n\n# Calculate the initial number of wheels in the box\ninitial_wheels_in_box = total_wheels_required + remaining_wheels\n\n# Output the result\nprint(initial_wheels_in_box)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of wheels originally present in the box."
