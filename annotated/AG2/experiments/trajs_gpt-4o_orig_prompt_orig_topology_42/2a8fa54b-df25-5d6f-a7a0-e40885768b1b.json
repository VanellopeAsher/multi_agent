You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

Let \\( x \\) represent the forgotten score.\n3. The total number of scores is 9 (8 known scores plus the forgotten score).\n4. The sum of all scores divided by 9 should equal the mean, which is 70.\n\nSet up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + x}{9} = 70\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation for \\( x \\) using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the forgotten score\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Known scores\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# Equation to calculate the mean\nequation = Eq((sum(scores) + x) / 9, 70)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nforgotten_score = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the forgotten score\nprint(forgotten_score)\n```\n\nThis code sets up the equation for the mean and solves for the forgotten score, printing the result.
