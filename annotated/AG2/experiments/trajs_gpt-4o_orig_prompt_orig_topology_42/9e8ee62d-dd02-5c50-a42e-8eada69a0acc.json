You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

We know the beanstalk started at 3 inches in the first week.\n2. In the second week, it doubled in height to \\(2 \\times 3\\) inches.\n3. By the end of the third week, its total height is 10 inches.\n\nThe problem asks us to find out how many inches the beanstalk grew in the third week. \n\nSince we have a mathematical sequence of events, this is Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.\n\nWe can write a Python script to compute the height at each stage and subtract the second week's height from the third week's to get the growth in the third week.\n\nLet's write the code to find the growth in the third week:\n\n```python\ninitial_height = 3  # height after first week in inches\nsecond_week_height = 2 * initial_height  # doubled in the second week\n\n# Total height after third week is given as 10 inches\ntotal_height_after_third_week = 10\n\n# Growth in the third week is calculated by the total height minus the second week height\ngrowth_third_week = total_height_after_third_week - second_week_height\n\nprint(growth_third_week)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the height the beanstalk grew in the third week."
