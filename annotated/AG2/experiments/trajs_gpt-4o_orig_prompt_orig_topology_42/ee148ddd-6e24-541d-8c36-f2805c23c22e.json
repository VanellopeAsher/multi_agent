  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

We will use Python to help with calculations.\n\n### Key Idea to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Calculate Total Time Spent on Activities (`T`)**:\n   - Boating: 6 hours\n   - Swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows Ã— 2 hours/show = 6 hours\n   - The total time for these activities is given as 30% of his total time (`T`).\n   \n2. **Determine Time Spent Sightseeing**:\n   - Sightseeing accounts for 40% of `T`.\n   \n3. **Set Up Equations**:\n   - Equation for total activity time (30% of `T`): \\( (6 + 3 + 6) = 0.3 \\times T \\).\n   - Solve for `T` to find the total time.\n   - Calculate 40% of `T` for sightseeing time.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define total time T as a symbol\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Boating, swimming, and watching shows\nboating_time = 6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshow_time = 3 * 2\n\n# Total activity time is 30% of T\nactivity_time = boating_time + swimming_time + show_time\nequation = Eq(activity_time, 0.3 * T)\n\n# Solve for T\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Sightseeing time is 40% of total time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time\n\n# Print the sightseeing time\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total time John spent on activities and determines how much time he spent sightseeing. The result in fraction form is printed. Let's find the answer in boxed form for the sightseeing time."
