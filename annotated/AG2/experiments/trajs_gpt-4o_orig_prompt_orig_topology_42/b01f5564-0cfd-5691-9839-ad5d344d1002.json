You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein.

We will first find out how much protein John gets from 300 grams of mushrooms, and then multiply that by 7 to find the weekly protein intake.\n\nLet's proceed to write the Python code:\n\n```python\n# Amount of protein in one cup of mushrooms (150 grams)\nprotein_per_cup = 4  # grams\n\n# Weight of one cup of mushrooms\nweight_per_cup = 150  # grams\n\n# Calculate the protein in 300 grams of mushrooms\nprotein_in_300_grams = (300 / weight_per_cup) * protein_per_cup\n\n# Calculate the weekly protein intake (7 days a week)\nweekly_protein_intake = protein_in_300_grams * 7\n\n# Output the result\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\nWe calculate the protein content in 300 grams and then use that to find the weekly intake. Let's execute this code to get the answer."
