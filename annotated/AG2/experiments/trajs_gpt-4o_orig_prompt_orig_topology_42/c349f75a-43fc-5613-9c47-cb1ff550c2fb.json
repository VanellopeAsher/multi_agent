You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters.

We are given that there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters.\n2. Each sister is 16 years old. Therefore, the total age of all the sisters combined is \\( 10 \\times 16 \\).\n3. One brother is 12 years old, which means the older brother is twice this age, i.e., \\( 2 \\times 12 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\n- The total age of the sisters is \\( 10 \\times 16 = 160 \\).\n- The age of the younger brother is 12.\n- The age of the older brother is \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total age of all siblings is:\n\n\\[\n160 + 12 + 24\n\\]\n\nI'll write a Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Define the ages\nsisters_age = 16\nnumber_of_sisters = 10\nyounger_brother_age = 12\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Calculate the total age\ntotal_age = (number_of_sisters * sisters_age) + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\n# Output the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nYou can run this code to find out the total age of all the siblings.
