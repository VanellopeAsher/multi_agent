You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.

Since the month of February can have different lengths, we need to use the provided information to determine the number of days in February.\n\nHere's how we can tackle the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the number of days in February using the information that there are 2.8 times of ten days in the month.\n2. Calculate the total number of articles published by each website based on their daily output and the number of days in February.\n3. Sum the totals from both websites to get the combined total number of articles.\n\nSince this problem can be directly solved by arithmetic calculations using Python, we'll follow Case 1.\n\n```python\n# Import the required package\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of days in February\ndays_in_february = 2.8 * 10  # Given information\n\n# Number of articles published daily by the two websites\ndaily_articles_website1 = 20  # political and weather news\ndaily_articles_website2 = 10  # business news\n\n# Calculate total articles for each website\ntotal_articles_website1 = daily_articles_website1 * days_in_february\ntotal_articles_website2 = daily_articles_website2 * days_in_february\n\n# Calculate total articles published together\ntotal_articles = total_articles_website1 + total_articles_website2\n\n# Print the result in fraction\nprint(Rational(total_articles))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the total number of articles published in February by both websites using a fraction to avoid decimals."
