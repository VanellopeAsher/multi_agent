You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 15 years less than ten times the age of his son.

According to the problem, Carver's age is 15 years less than ten times the age of his son.\n3. Carver's current age is 45.\n\nWe can translate this information into the following equation:\n\n\\[ 45 = 10x - 15 \\]\n\nOur task is to solve this equation for \\( x \\) using Python.\n\nSince the problem is straightforward and can be directly solved with Python, I will write a short program to compute the value of \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation according to the problem description\nequation = Eq(45, 10 * x - 15)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"The age of Carver's son is:\", solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code uses sympy to define and solve the equation.
