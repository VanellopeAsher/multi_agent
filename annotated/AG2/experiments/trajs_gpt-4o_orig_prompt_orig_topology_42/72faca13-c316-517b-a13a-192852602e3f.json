You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

This problem involves basic arithmetic calculations, so it can be solved directly with Python code (Case 1).\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Calculate the initial amount of money Kelly has.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the items she buys.\n3. Subtract the cost from the initial amount to find out how much she has left.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations using fractions where necessary.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the initial amount Kelly has\nquarters = 5\ndimes = 2\ntotal_money = quarters * 25 + dimes * 10\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the items\npop_cost = 55\ncandy_bar_cost = 45\ntotal_cost = pop_cost + candy_bar_cost\n\n# Calculate the money left\nmoney_left = total_money - total_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(Rational(money_left))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it should provide the result in cents for how much money Kelly has left after making her purchases."

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 25 = 125 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n2. Kelly also has 2 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. The total amount of money Kelly initially has:\n   \\[\n   125 + 20 = 145 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents. The total cost is:\n   \\[\n   55 + 45 = 100 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. Subtracting the total cost from the initial amount gives us the amount left:\n   \\[\n   145 - 100 = 45 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Kelly will have 45 cents left after her purchases.
