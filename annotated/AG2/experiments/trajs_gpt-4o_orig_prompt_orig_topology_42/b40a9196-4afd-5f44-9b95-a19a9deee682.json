You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

The food items include milk and eggs, while the non-food items include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. We then calculate the total cost for each category and apply a 10% tax to the non-food items. Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total cost.\n\nLet's solve the problem using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Cost of each item\nmilk_cost = 2\neggs_cost = 3\nlight_bulbs_cost = 3\ncups_cost = 3\nroach_traps_cost = 4\n\n# Tax rate for non-food items\ntax_rate = Rational(10, 100)\n\n# Calculate the total cost of food items\nfood_items_total = milk_cost + eggs_cost\n\n# Calculate the total cost of non-food items\nnon_food_items_total = light_bulbs_cost + cups_cost + roach_traps_cost\n\n# Calculate the tax on non-food items\ntax_on_non_food_items = non_food_items_total * tax_rate\n\n# Calculate the total cost including tax\ntotal_cost = food_items_total + non_food_items_total + tax_on_non_food_items\n\n# Print the result in fraction form\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nWhen you run the above code, it will calculate the total cost of all items with tax applied to the non-food items, using fractions to ensure accuracy and clarity."
