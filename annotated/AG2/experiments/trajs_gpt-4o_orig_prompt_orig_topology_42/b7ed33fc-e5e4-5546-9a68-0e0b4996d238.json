You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.

      "content": "To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving both a normal and an extreme sudoku, we need to find the total number of hours he spends on both activities and calculate the number of bottles based on his drinking rate.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Calculate the total time taken for both sudokus.\n2. Determine how many half-hour periods fit into that total time to find the number of bottles he drinks.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the time spent on a normal sudoku and an extreme sudoku in minutes\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30  # minutes\nextreme_sudoku_time = 3 * normal_sudoku_time  # 3 times the normal time in minutes\n\n# Calculate total time spent on both sudokus\ntotal_time_minutes = normal_sudoku_time + extreme_sudoku_time\n\n# Since John drinks a bottle every half hour (30 minutes),\n# calculate the number of bottles:\nbottles = total_time_minutes // 30\n\nprint(bottles)\n```\n\nThe code will output the number of bottles of water John drinks during this time."
