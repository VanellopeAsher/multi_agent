You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSeth is twice as old as Brooke.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the conditions described. Then, we'll solve the equations to find Seth's current age.\n\nKey idea: This problem can be handled by setting up equations and solving them directly using mathematical reasoning, so we'll proceed with that approach.\n\nLet \\( s \\) be Seth's current age and \\( b \\) be Brooke's current age. According to the problem:\n\n1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke:  \n   \\[ s = 2b \\]\n\n2. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36:  \n   \\[ (s + 3) + (b + 3) = 36 \\]\n\nNow let's simplify and solve this system of equations step by step:\n\n1. Simplify the second equation:\n   \\[ s + 3 + b + 3 = 36 \\]\n   \\[ s + b + 6 = 36 \\]\n   \\[ s + b = 30 \\]\n\n2. We already have \\( s = 2b \\). Substitute \\( s = 2b \\) into the equation \\( s + b = 30 \\):\n   \\[ 2b + b = 30 \\]\n   \\[ 3b = 30 \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( b \\):\n   \\[ b = \\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\]\n\n4. Substitute \\( b = 10 \\) back into \\( s = 2b \\) to find \\( s \\):\n   \\[ s = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, Seth is currently \\( \\boxed{20} \\) years old."
