You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 100 miles a week.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use mathematical calculations to find John's running speed. The goal is to determine his average running speed per hour.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe'll calculate how many miles John runs in total and divide this by the total time he spends running in order to find his speed in miles per hour.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Determine how many hours John runs on each day:\n   - On the first day, he runs for 10 hours.\n   - On the second and third days, he runs for half of 10 hours, which is 5 hours each.\n\n2. Calculate the total hours he runs in a week:\n   - Total hours run = 10 (first day) + 5 (second day) + 5 (third day).\n\n3. Find John's running speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours run:\n   - Speed = Total miles / Total hours run.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for rational output\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total miles run per week\ntotal_miles = 100\n\n# Calculating hours run for each day\nhours_first_day = 10\nhours_other_days = hours_first_day / 2  # He runs half as much on the other two days\n\n# Total hours run in a week\ntotal_hours = hours_first_day + 2 * hours_other_days\n\n# Calculate John's running speed in miles per hour\nspeed = Rational(total_miles, total_hours)\n\n# Print the speed in miles per hour\nprint(speed)\n```\n\nOnce you run this code, you'll have John's average running speed formatted as a rational number."
