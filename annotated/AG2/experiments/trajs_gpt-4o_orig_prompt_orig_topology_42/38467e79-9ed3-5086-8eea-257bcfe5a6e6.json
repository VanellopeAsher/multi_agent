You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home.

We know that two-thirds of these students have a desktop computer at home, and 30 students do not. This information allows us to set up an equation to find the total number of students.\n\nLet's set the total number of students be \\( x \\).\n\nSince two-thirds of students have a desktop computer, one-third of students do not. If 30 students do not have desktop computers, we can use this information to set up an equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} x = 30\n\\]\n\nWe will solve this equation to find \\( x \\).\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for the number of students\nequation = Eq(x / 3, 30)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_students = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_students)\n```\n\nThis code uses SymPy to symbolically solve the equation for the total number of students. Let's execute it to find the answer."
