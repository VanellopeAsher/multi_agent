You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old.

Let's use algebra to set up the equations:\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the age of John,\n\\( y \\) be the age of Paul, and\n\\( z \\) be the age of Peter.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n\n1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years.\n   \\[\n   x + y + z = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul is 18 years older than John.\n   \\[\n   y = x + 18\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.\n   \\[\n   z = x + y\n   \\]\n\nNow we can solve these equations to find the values of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\), particularly the age of Peter (\\( z \\)).\n\nI'll write a Python program to solve these equations using the sympy library.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\neq1 = Eq(x + y + z, 100)\neq2 = Eq(y, x + 18)\neq3 = Eq(z, x + y)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (x, y, z))\n\n# Extract the age of Peter (z)\npeters_age = solution[z]\n\n# Output the age of Peter using a print function\nprint(f\"Peter's age is {peters_age}.\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the age of Peter."
