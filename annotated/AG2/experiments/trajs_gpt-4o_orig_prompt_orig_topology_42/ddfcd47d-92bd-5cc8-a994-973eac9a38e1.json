You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia.

We know that Rayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy.\n3. Find the total money they have combined.\n4. Divide the total by 3 to find out how much each person gets when they share equally.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the sympy library to maintain the fractions.\n\n```python\n# Import the required library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# How much money each person initially has\naurelia_money = 150\nkassidy_money = Rational(2, 3) * aurelia_money\nrayna_money = kassidy_money + 70\n\n# Calculate the total money\ntotal_money = aurelia_money + kassidy_money + rayna_money\n\n# Divide equally\nequal_share = total_money / 3\n\n# Print out each person's equal share using fractions\nfrom sympy import pprint\nprint(\"Equal share for each person:\")\npprint(equal_share)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will calculate and display the equal amount of money each person would have if they pooled together their money and shared it evenly."
