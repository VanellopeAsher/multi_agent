We can first solve for the number of cookies each person has using the relationships given and the constraint that Katarina has a specific number of cookies.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nC_m = symbols('C_m')  # Cookies with Cookie Monster\nmax_cookies = 1.2 * (10 + C_m)  # Max's cookies\nkatarina_cookies = max_cookies - 5  # Katarina's cookies\nsummer_cookies = max_cookies + 23  # Summer's cookies\n\n# Given that Katarina has 6.8 times 10 cookies\nkatarina_given_cookies = 6.8 * 10\n\n# Equation for Katarina's cookies\neq = Eq(katarina_cookies, katarina_given_cookies)\n\n# Solve the equation to find Cookie Monster's cookies\nsolution = solve(eq, C_m)\nC_m_value = solution[0]\n\n# Calculate the number of cookies each person has\nmax_cookies_value = 1.2 * (10 + C_m_value)\nkatarina_cookies_value = max_cookies_value - 5\nsummer_cookies_value = max_cookies_value + 23\n\n# Calculate the total number of cookies\ntotal_cookies = C_m_value + max_cookies_value + katarina_cookies_value + summer_cookies_value\n\n# Print the total number of cookies\nprint(total_cookies)\n```\n\nThe solution to this equation will give us the number of cookies for the Cookie Monster, and subsequently, we can find all other values and the total count.
