You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nLeah just got a new kitten.

Apply the 10% discount to find the actual cost Leah paid for the vaccines.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the broken vases.\n4. Sum all the expenses to find out the total cost so far.\n\nThis problem can be directly solved using Python, so we will use Case 1. We will write a program to calculate the total cost using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# The cost of spaying\nspaying_cost = 200\n\n# The cost of vaccines before discount\nvaccine_cost = 3 * 20\n\n# Discount on vaccines\ndiscount = Rational(10, 100) * vaccine_cost\n\n# Actual cost of vaccines after discount\nactual_vaccine_cost = vaccine_cost - discount\n\n# The cost of broken vases\nvase_cost = 4 * 12\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = spaying_cost + actual_vaccine_cost + vase_cost\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(f\"The total cost is: {total_cost}\")\n```\n\nLet's calculate it step by step to verify correctness:\n\n- Total vaccine cost = 3 vaccines × $20 = $60\n- Discount = 10% of $60 = \\(10/100 \\times 60 = 6\\)\n- Actual vaccine cost = $60 - $6 = $54\n- Cost of broken vases = 4 vases × $12 = $48\n- Total cost = $200 (spaying) + $54 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $302\n\nTherefore, the total cost Leah has incurred so far is \\(\\boxed{302}\\)."
