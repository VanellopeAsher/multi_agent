You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn November, a toy was $4000.

Calculate the price after the 80% increase in December.\n2. Calculate the price after the 50% decrease in January.\n\nLet's break down the steps and calculate the final price using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to handle fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial price of the toy in November\ninitial_price = 4000\n\n# Calculate the price after an 80% increase in December\nprice_after_december = initial_price * (1 + Rational(80, 100))\n\n# Calculate the price after a 50% decrease in January\nfinal_price = price_after_december * (1 - Rational(50, 100))\n\n# Print the final price using fractions\nprint(f\"The final price of the toy in January is {final_price}\")\n```\n\nBy running the code, we can determine the price of the toy after the adjustments."
