You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

Let \\( h \\) be the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week.\n2. After the second week, the height is doubled, resulting in \\( 2h \\).\n3. After the third week, 4 inches are added to the height, resulting in \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nSince the problem does not provide the initial height \\( h \\), we can't compute a specific numerical answer. However, we can express the final height symbolically.\n\nHere's how we can write this in Python using symbolic computation with SymPy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the initial height after the first week\nh = symbols('h')\n\n# Calculate the height after 3 weeks\nheight_after_3_weeks = 2 * h + 4\n\n# Simplify and print the result\nprint(simplify(height_after_3_weeks))\n```\n\nThis code expresses the solution symbolically by returning the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks as \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, without the initial value of \\( h \\), the height after 3 weeks is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2h + 4}\n\\]"
