You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

We will calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples, and then subtract these from the total amount Marie paid to determine the cost attributable to the pizzas. Finally, we divide by the cost per box of pizza to find out how many boxes were ordered.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol for the number of pizza boxes\np = symbols('p')\n\n# Calculate costs of individual items\nchicken_meal_cost = 120\nmilk_cost = 5 * 30\napples_cost = 40 * 1.5\n\n# Total cost equation\ntotal_cost = 900\npizza_cost_per_box = 57\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(chicken_meal_cost + milk_cost + apples_cost + p * pizza_cost_per_box, total_cost)\n\n# Solve for p (number of pizza boxes)\nnumber_of_pizzas = solve(equation, p)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'Marie ordered {number_of_pizzas} boxes of pizza.')\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered.
