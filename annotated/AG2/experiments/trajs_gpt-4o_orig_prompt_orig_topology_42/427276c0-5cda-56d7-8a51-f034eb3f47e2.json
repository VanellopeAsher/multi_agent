You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels.

We need to find the sum of the heights of all the heels and then divide by the total number of women.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of women wearing heels.\n2. Compute the total height of all the heels.\n3. Divide the total height by the number of women to get the average height.\n\nLet's write a Python program to find the average height of the heels:\n\n```python\n# Number of women wearing 4.5-inch heels\nnum_women_4_5 = 3\n\n# Number of women wearing 2.5-inch heels\nnum_women_2_5 = 3\n\n# Height of heels\nheight_4_5 = 4.5\nheight_2_5 = 2.5\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = num_women_4_5 + num_women_2_5\n\n# Total height of heels\ntotal_height = (num_women_4_5 * height_4_5) + (num_women_2_5 * height_2_5)\n\n# Average height of heels\naverage_height = total_height / total_women\n\n# Print the result in fraction form\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(average_height))\n```\n\nThis program calculates the average heel height considering the total number of women and sum of the heel heights. The result is displayed as a fraction to adhere to the required format."
