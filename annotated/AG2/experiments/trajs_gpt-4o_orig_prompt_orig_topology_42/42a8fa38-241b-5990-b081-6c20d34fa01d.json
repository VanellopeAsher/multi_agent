You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables.

This can be done directly using Python by calculating the cost for each type of seed packet and then summing them up. Here's how it can be done:\n\n```python\n# Number of packets purchased\ntomato_packets = 20\ncelery_packets = 80\n\n# Prices per packet\nprice_per_tomato_packet = 40\nprice_per_celery_packet = 30\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = (tomato_packets * price_per_tomato_packet) + (celery_packets * price_per_celery_packet)\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on purchasing the seeds."
