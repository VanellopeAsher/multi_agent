  "problem": "When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour than brfore. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the hourly wages of Billy and Sally at the time in question and compute their earnings based on a 20-hour week.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Billy's Salary\n1. **Starting Salary:** $10 per hour\n2. **After 2 Months:** He gets a raise of $0.50, giving him $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n3. **After 12 Months:** He gets an additional $1.00 raise. Thus, his hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.\n\n### Sally's Salary\n1. **Starting Salary:** $10 (Billy's starting salary) + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour\n2. **After 2 Months:** She gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, leading to $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.\n\nNow, calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally over 20 hours with these hourly rates and determine the difference.\n\n```python\n# Calculation using their post-anniversary rates\nbilly_rate = 11.50  # Billy's current hourly wage\nsally_rate = 11.00  # Sally's current hourly wage\n\n# Both work 20 hours\nbilly_earnings = billy_rate * 20\nsally_earnings = sally_rate * 20\n\n# Calculate the difference in earnings\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nAfter running the code, you will find that Billy earns \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars more than Sally when they both work 20 hours."
