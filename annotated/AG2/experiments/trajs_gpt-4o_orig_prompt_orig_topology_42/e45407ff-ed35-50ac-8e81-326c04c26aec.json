You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the cost per bottle of scotch.**  \n   Since John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10.\n\n2. **Determine the cost per bottle of cognac.**  \n   The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, we need to calculate this based on the cost per bottle of scotch.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cognac bottles and their total cost.**  \n   John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch. Therefore, he buys \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) bottles of cognac. Calculate the total cost of these 20 bottles.\n\n4. **Calculate the total money spent.**  \n   Sum the cost of all the scotch bottles and all the cognac bottles.\n\nLet's go through these steps using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for calculations\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch\ntotal_scotch_cost = 600\nnum_scotch_bottles = 10\ncost_per_scotch_bottle = Rational(total_scotch_cost, num_scotch_bottles)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the cost per bottle of cognac\ncost_per_cognac_bottle = cost_per_scotch_bottle * Rational(3, 2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total cost for cognac\nnum_cognac_bottles = 2 * num_scotch_bottles\ntotal_cognac_cost = cost_per_cognac_bottle * num_cognac_bottles\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total cost spent on everything\ntotal_cost = total_scotch_cost + total_cognac_cost\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow, let's evaluate this code to find out the total amount spent."
