  "problem": "It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

This is a typical problem that can be modeled with a system of linear equations. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:\n\nLet's denote the number of packets of tomato seeds as \\( x \\).\n\nWe know that:\n1. Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.\n2. Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.\n3. Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n4. The total cost for the seeds is $3200.\n\nThe sum of the costs for the tomato seeds and celery seeds should equal the total cost:\n\\[ 40x + 30 \\times 80 = 3200 \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation for \\( x \\):\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Using the information given in the problem\n# 40x + 30 * 80 = 3200\nequation = Eq(40*x + 30*80, 3200)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this Python code to find out how many packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought."
