You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a direct approach because it involves simple proportionality.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nSince 60 potatoes result in 360 hash browns, we can find the number of hash browns per potato and then use this ratio to determine how many hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n1. Calculate the ratio of hash browns per potato.\n2. Multiply the ratio by the number of potatoes (960) to find the total number of hash browns.\n\nLet's write a Python program to do these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import the Fraction module from sympy to ensure we use fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\npotatoes_made_of_60 = 360\npotatoes_available = 960\n\n# Calculate hash browns per potato\nhash_browns_per_potato = Rational(potatoes_made_of_60, 60)\n\n# How many hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes\nhash_browns_from_960 = hash_browns_per_potato * potatoes_available\n\n# Print the result in fraction form\nprint(hash_browns_from_960)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we can obtain the number of hash browns that can be made from 960 potatoes in fraction form. \n\nIn this specific case, the answer is straightforward due to the problem's direct proportionality nature, without needing simplifications beyond the ratio. The computed result in the program will give us the exact integer answer for this scenario. \n\nNow, when you run this code, it should correctly output the total number of hash browns as an integer, which should be formatted in a box as \\(\\boxed{5760}\\)."
