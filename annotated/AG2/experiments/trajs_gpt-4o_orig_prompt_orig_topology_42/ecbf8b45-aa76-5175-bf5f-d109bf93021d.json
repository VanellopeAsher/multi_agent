Now that we know the total number of balloons thrown is given by the expression \\(30x - 12\\), we just need the number of packs filled to compute the exact number of balloons thrown. Let's finalize this with one assumption: if we assume \\( x \\) is the number of packs filled, this expression tells us that:\n\n1. For each pack filled, there are 30 balloons.\n2. Subtract 12 balloons for the ones remaining (not thrown).\n\nGiven this, if you provide the number of packs filled, you can substitute it into the expression \\(30x - 12\\) to get the exact number of balloons thrown. If you say, for example, there were 5 packs filled, you would substitute that in to get the total balloons thrown:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the number of balloons thrown for a given number of packs\n# Replace `n` with the actual number of packs filled.\nn = 5  # for example\nballoons_thrown = 30 * n - 12\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nJust adjust `n` to the correct number of packs filled, and run the code to get the answer!
