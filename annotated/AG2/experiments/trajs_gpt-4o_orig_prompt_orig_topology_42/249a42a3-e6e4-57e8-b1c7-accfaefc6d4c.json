You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n### Key Idea:\n1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.\n2. Determine 80% of those days (since he takes 20% off).\n3. Calculate the number of people Billy can help per day.\n4. Multiply the number of working days by the number of people he can help per day to find the total number of people he helps.\n\nNow, let's implement this using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom math import ceil\n\n# Number of days in March\nmarch_days = 31\n# Number of days from April 1st to April 19th\napril_days = 19\n\n# Total days Billy is available from March 1st to April 19th\ntotal_days = march_days + april_days\n\n# 20% of these days are off, so 80% are working days\nworking_days = ceil(total_days * 0.8)\n\n# Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours a day\npeople_per_hour = 2\nhours_per_day = 3.5\npeople_per_day = people_per_hour * hours_per_day\n\n# Total number of people he helps\ntotal_people_helped = working_days * people_per_day\n\n# Output the result in fraction form\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Convert total_people_helped to a fraction\ntotal_people_helped_fraction = Fraction(total_people_helped).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(total_people_helped_fraction)\n```\n\nLet's calculate it to find the final answer."
