You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo girls each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water.

We will calculate the total amount of water distributed to the girls and the boy, and then subtract it from the initial amount of water to find the remaining amount.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Calculate how much water each girl received.\n2. Calculate the total water given to the two girls.\n3. Add the water taken by the boy.\n4. Subtract the total distributed water from the initial amount to find the amount left.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Import the required module\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial amount of water\ntotal_water = 32\n\n# Each girl gets 1/4 of the total water\nwater_per_girl = Rational(1, 4) * total_water\n\n# Total water taken by the girls\ntotal_water_girls = 2 * water_per_girl\n\n# Water received by the boy\nwater_boy = 8\n\n# Calculate the remaining water\nremaining_water = total_water - (total_water_girls + water_boy)\n\n# Print the remaining water\nprint(remaining_water)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will provide you with the amount of water left in its simplest form. The result will be expressed as an integer or fraction as appropriate."
