You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: The initial amount of water is 4000 gallons.\n\n2. **After Heavy Rain (Second Day)**: The amount of water doubles due to heavy rain, so it becomes:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Day Increase**: By the third day, the total amount is 14000 gallons. We want to find out how much this increased from the previous amount (after the rain on the second day).\n\n4. **Calculate the Increase**: The increase on the third day is:\n   \\[\n   14000 - 8000 = 6000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's express this reasoning in Python code.\n\n```python\n# Increase calculation on the third day\ninitial_amount = 4000\nsecond_day_amount = 2 * initial_amount\nthird_day_amount = 14000\n\nincrease_third_day = third_day_amount - second_day_amount\nprint(increase_third_day)\n```\n\nThis code calculates and prints the increase in volume on the third day. The expected value should be 6000 gallons, and we can enclose the final answer as follows:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]"
