You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

One brother's age is given as \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 20\\), which is half the age of the older brother.\n\nWe can calculate each individual's age and then sum them up to find the total age. Let's use Python to perform these calculations using fractions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols\n\n# Calculate the age of a sister\nage_factor = Rational(16, 10)  # 1.6 in fractional form\nten = 10\nsister_age = age_factor * ten\n\n# Calculate the age of the younger brother and the older brother\nyounger_brother_age = Rational(3, 5) * 20\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Define the total age of siblings\ntotal_age = 3 * sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nNow we run this code to calculate the total age of the siblings."
