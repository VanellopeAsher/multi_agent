You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery Saturday, Jill along with her companions view 4 films and on Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays.

This is a straightforward calculation that can be done directly with Python.\n\nGiven:\n- On Saturdays, they watch 4 films.\n- On Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays, so that's 4/2 = 2 films.\n- The routine is followed every weekend, and we need to find the total over 4 weeks.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of films watched each weekend\nfilms_per_weekend = 4 + 2\n\n# Calculate the total number over 4 weeks\ntotal_films_in_4_weeks = films_per_weekend * 4\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_films_in_4_weeks)\n```\n\nThe result from running this code will give us the total number of films watched in 4 weeks."
