You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Determine Total Time Based on Percentage**: Since the total hours mentioned (boating, swimming, and watching shows) account for 30% of his total time, we can calculate the total time spent on vacation by setting up an equation.\n\n2. **Calculate Each Activity's Duration**:\n    - Time spent boating: 6 hours\n    - Time spent swimming: \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours\n    - Time spent watching shows: \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\n3. **Compute Total Time Spent**: Sum the hours for all activities mentioned:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time for activities} = 6 + 3 + 6\n   \\] \n\n4. **Compute the Total Time on Vacation**: Use the information that this time is 30% of his total vacation time to set up an equation and compute the full time spent.\n\n5. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing**: Subtract the time already accounted for (boating, swimming, shows) from the total vacation time.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Define the symbol for the total vacation time\ntotal_vacation_time = symbols('total_vacation_time')\n\n# Step 3: Calculate total time accounted for in activities\nboating_time = 6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 3 * 2\n\ntotal_known_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time\n\n# Step 4: Set up the equation for total vacation time (30% of total)\nequation = Eq(0.3 * total_vacation_time, total_known_time)\n\n# Step 5: Solve for the total vacation time\ntotal_time_vacation = solve(equation, total_vacation_time)[0]\n\n# Calculate time spent sightseeing\ntime_sightseeing = total_time_vacation - total_known_time\n\n# Output the time spent sightseeing\nprint(\"Time spent sightseeing:\", time_sightseeing)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the result."
