      "content": "To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total yearly cost of each item and then sum them up. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how we can do it:\n\n1. **Food Costs**: The dog food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is \\( 25 \\times 4 \\). To find the yearly cost, multiply the monthly cost by 12 months.\n\n2. **Treat Costs**: Treats cost $20 per month, so the yearly cost is \\( 20 \\times 12 \\).\n\n3. **Medicine Costs**: Medicine costs $100 per month, so the yearly cost is \\( 100 \\times 12 \\).\n\n4. **Shampoo Costs**: Shampoo costs $15 per month, which results in a yearly cost of \\( 15 \\times 12 \\).\n\n5. **Toy Costs**: The toy costs $10 every two months, meaning Madeline buys 6 toys per year. Therefore, the yearly cost is \\( 10 \\times 6 \\).\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate the total annual cost Madeline spends on her dog.\n\n```python\n# Define costs\nweekly_food_cost = 25\nmonthly_treat_cost = 20\nmonthly_medicine_cost = 100\nmonthly_shampoo_cost = 15\nbimonthly_toy_cost = 10\n\n# Calculate annual costs\nannual_food_cost = weekly_food_cost * 4 * 12\nannual_treat_cost = monthly_treat_cost * 12\nannual_medicine_cost = monthly_medicine_cost * 12\nannual_shampoo_cost = monthly_shampoo_cost * 12\nannual_toy_cost = bimonthly_toy_cost * 6\n\n# Calculate total annual cost\ntotal_annual_cost = (annual_food_cost + annual_treat_cost +\n                     annual_medicine_cost + annual_shampoo_cost +\n                     annual_toy_cost)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year is: ${total_annual_cost}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total annual expenditure Madeline incurs for her dog. Let's sum them up:\n\n- Annual food cost: \\( 25 \\times 4 \\times 12 = 1200 \\)\n- Annual treat cost: \\( 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\)\n- Annual medicine cost: \\( 100 \\times 12 = 1200 \\)\n- Annual shampoo cost: \\( 15 \\times 12 = 180 \\)\n- Annual toy cost: \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\)\n\nBy adding all these together, the total amount is \\(\\boxed{2880}\\)."
