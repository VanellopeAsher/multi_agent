      "content": "To solve this problem, let's assume we can find the solution using a mathematical approach with an illustrative example. This can be handled by Case 1, where we directly solve the problem using Python.\n\nHere are the steps for our approach:\n1. Assume a hypothetical length for the shark because the exact value is not given in the problem statement. For simplicity, let's take the shark's length as a variable `L`.\n2. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras. Since each remora is 6 inches, the combined length of the two remoras is 12 inches (2 remoras Ã— 6 inches each).\n3. Calculate what percentage 12 inches is of the shark's length `L`.\n4. Use Python to compute and print this percentage in its simplest fractional form using sympy's functionality.\n\nLet's assume `L` is in inches for consistency, and we'll implement the calculations in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational, pprint\n\n# Assume the length of the shark is a symbol L\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Combined length of the remoras\nremora_length = 2 * 6  # 2 remoras, each 6 inches\n\n# Calculate the percentage of remora length with respect to the shark's length L\npercentage = Rational(remora_length, L) * 100\n\n# Print the result as a fraction\npprint(percentage)\n```\n\nPlease provide the actual length of the shark if you want a specific numeric result, or we can consider `L` as a hypothetical or placeholder variable."

We should compute the symbolic expression differently in sympy without using `Rational` directly in this context for the percentage. Instead, we will perform symbolic multiplication and then print the result.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Assume the length of the shark is a symbol L\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Combined length of the remoras\nremora_length = 2 * 6  # 2 remoras, each 6 inches\n\n# Calculate the percentage of remora length with respect to the shark's length L\npercentage = (remora_length / L) * 100\n\n# Simplify the expression and print the result\nsimplified_percentage = simplify(percentage)\nprint(simplified_percentage)\n```\n\nThis should work without issues and provide you with a symbolic expression for the percentage of the shark's length represented by the combined remora length."
