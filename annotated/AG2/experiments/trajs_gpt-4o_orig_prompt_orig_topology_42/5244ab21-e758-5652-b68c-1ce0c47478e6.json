You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We can calculate each of these quantities step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of oranges:**\n   - She purchased a dozen boxes, and each box contains 20 oranges.\n   - Total number of oranges = \\( 12 \\times 20 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the oranges given as gifts:**\n   - She gifted two boxes to her mother and two boxes to her sibling.\n   - Oranges gifted = \\( (2 + 2) \\times 20 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of remaining oranges after the gifts:**\n   - Remaining oranges = Total oranges - Oranges gifted.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington retains for herself:**\n   - She keeps a quarter of the remaining oranges.\n   - Oranges retained = \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times\\) Remaining oranges.\n\n5. **Determine the number of oranges sold:**\n   - Oranges sold = Remaining oranges - Oranges retained.\n\nNow, we can proceed with the calculations using a Python script:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges\ntotal_oranges = 12 * 20\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the oranges gifted (4 boxes * 20 oranges/box)\noranges_gifted = 4 * 20\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the remaining after gifts\nremaining_oranges = total_oranges - oranges_gifted\n\n# Step 4: Calculate how many she retained for herself (1/4 of remaining)\noranges_retained = Fraction(1, 4) * remaining_oranges\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the number of oranges sold\noranges_sold = remaining_oranges - oranges_retained\n\n# Output the number of oranges sold\nprint(f\"Oranges sold = {oranges_sold}\")\n```\n\nExecute the script, and we should find:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{160}\n\\]\n\nMrs. Harrington sold 160 oranges."
