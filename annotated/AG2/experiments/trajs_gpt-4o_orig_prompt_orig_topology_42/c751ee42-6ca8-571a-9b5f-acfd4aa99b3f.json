You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we should first identify which items are taxed and which are not. The formula to calculate the total cost, including tax on nonfood items, can then be implemented using Python.\n\n**Key Idea**: The problem can be solved through coding by segregating the taxed and untaxed items and applying the appropriate tax on the relevant items.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the items:\n- Food items (no tax): milk, eggs, cookies, bottle of water.\n- Nonfood items (subject to a 10% tax): light bulbs, cups, roach traps.\n\nNow, let's write a Python program to calculate the total cost including the tax:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices of items\nmilk_price = 2\neggs_price = 3\nlight_bulbs_price = 3\ncups_price = 3\nroach_traps_price = 4\ncookies_price = 2\nwater_price = 1\n\n# Tax rate for non-food items\ntax_rate = Rational(10, 100)\n\n# Non-food items total\nnon_food_total = light_bulbs_price + cups_price + roach_traps_price\n\n# Calculate the tax for non-food items\ntax = non_food_total * tax_rate\n\n# Total cost without tax\ntotal_without_tax = milk_price + eggs_price + cookies_price + water_price + non_food_total\n\n# Total cost including tax\ntotal_with_tax = total_without_tax + tax\n\nprint(total_with_tax)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total cost, taking into account the tax on non-food items. The total cost will be output in a fraction form, if applicable. Let's execute this code to find the total cost."
