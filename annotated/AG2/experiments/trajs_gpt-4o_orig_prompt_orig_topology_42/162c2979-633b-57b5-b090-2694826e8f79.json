  "problem": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

This falls under Case 1: The problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\nHere's the key idea:\n- Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, each costing $2.\n- She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.\n- She bought one small pack of green apple gum, which cost half of what the grape gum cost. Therefore, the green apple gum cost $1.\n\nLet's sum these costs using Python.\n\n```python\n# Cost calculations\nstrawberry_gum_cost = 2 * 2  # 2 packs of strawberry at $2 each\ngrape_gum_cost = 2           # 1 pack of grape gum at $2\ngreen_apple_gum_cost = grape_gum_cost / 2  # half of the grape gum cost\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = strawberry_gum_cost + grape_gum_cost + green_apple_gum_cost\n\n# Print the total cost in a readable form\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(f\"Total cost: {Rational(total_cost)}\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the total amount Suzie paid for all the gum packs and display it as a fraction, though in this case, it should be a whole number. Let's run the code to find out the total."
