You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Finally, we calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn to make up the difference using her earnings from mowing.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.\n2. Calculate how much Sara has saved already and from babysitting.\n3. Determine how much more money Sara needs to earn.\n4. Calculate the number of times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional money.\n\nLet's solve this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library for handling rational numbers\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost_per_pair = 100\ntotal_shoe_cost = 2 * shoe_cost_per_pair\n\n# Total cost for jacket and 2 pairs of shoes\ntotal_cost = jacket_cost + total_shoe_cost\n\n# Earnings from babysitting\nbabysittings = 10\nearnings_per_babysit = 5\ntotal_babysitting_earnings = babysittings * earnings_per_babysit\n\n# Initial savings\ninitial_savings = 100\n\n# Total current money Sara has\ntotal_current = initial_savings + total_babysitting_earnings\n\n# Required additional amount to afford the purchases\nneeded_amount = total_cost - total_current\n\n# Earnings from mowing the lawn\nearnings_per_mow = 10\n\n# Times she needs to mow the lawn\ntimes_to_mow = Rational(needed_amount, earnings_per_mow)\n\nprint(f\"Sara needs to mow the lawn {times_to_mow} times.\")\n\n# The result is in Rational form, but since she can't mow a fraction of a time, we round up.\ntimes_to_mow_rounded_up = int(times_to_mow) if times_to_mow == int(times_to_mow) else int(times_to_mow) + 1\nprint(f\"Sara must mow the lawn {times_to_mow_rounded_up} times to afford the jacket and shoes.\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will provide us with the exact number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn. Let's box the final answer.\n\n\\[\\boxed{10}\\]"
