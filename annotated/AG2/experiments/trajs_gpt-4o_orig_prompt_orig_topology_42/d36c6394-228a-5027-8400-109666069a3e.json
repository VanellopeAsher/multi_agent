You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\n48 people are riding a bus.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break down the steps based on what happens at each stop. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: There are 48 people on the bus.\n\n2. **First Stop**:\n   - 8 passengers get off.  \n   - Number of passengers after 8 leave: \\(48 - 8\\).\n   - 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. Therefore, \\(5 \\times 8\\) passengers get on.\n   - Before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again.\n\n3. **Second Stop**:\n   - 21 passengers get off.\n   - 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off. This means the number of people getting on is \\(\\frac{21}{3}\\).\n\nLet's now write a Python program to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Initial number of passengers\npassengers = 48\n\n# First stop\npassengers -= 8  # 8 passengers get off\npassengers += 5 * 8  # 5 times 8 passengers get on\npassengers -= 2  # 2 people get off before departure\n\n# Second stop\npassengers -= 21  # 21 passengers get off\npassengers += 21 // 3  # 3 times fewer passengers (21//3) get on\n\n# Output the number of passengers after the second stop\nprint(passengers)\n```\n\nBy evaluating this code, you will get the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop."
