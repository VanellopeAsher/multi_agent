You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDerrick has a bakery that makes doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut.

      "content": "Let's solve the problem using the following approach:\n\n**Key Idea**: Since Derrick sells each doughnut for $2 and assuming he sells all the doughnuts he makes every day, we just need to determine how many doughnuts are made each day in June, multiply that by the number of days in June, and finally multiply by the selling price per doughnut.\n\nGiven that we don't have the daily production number, we can assume he makes \\( n \\) doughnuts per day.\n\nTo calculate Derrick's revenue for June, we use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June: \\( n \\times 30 \\), since June has 30 days.\n2. Calculate the total money made: \\( (n \\times 30) \\times 2 \\).\n\nLet's assume Derrick produces \\( n \\) doughnuts per day and implement the calculations in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the variable for the number of doughnuts made per day\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Calculate the total revenue for June\ntotal_days = 30\nprice_per_doughnut = 2\n\n# The total revenue\ntotal_revenue = n * total_days * price_per_doughnut\n\nprint(total_revenue)\n```\n\nIn this code, \\( n \\) is a symbolic representation of the number of doughnuts made per day. The printed expression will show the formula for total revenue in terms of \\( n \\). You can replace \\( n \\) with any specific number of doughnuts made per day to get a numerical result."
