You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard.

Identify the heights of the three trees:\n   - The shortest tree is 60 feet.\n   - The second tree is 50 feet more than the shortest tree, which means it is \\(60 + 50\\) feet.\n   - The tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined.\n\n2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and the second tree.\n3. Calculate the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height from step 2.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform these calculations using sympy for exact arithmetic:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Heights of the first two trees\nheight_shortest = Rational(60)\nheight_second = height_shortest + 50\n\n# Combined height of shortest and second tree\ncombined_height = height_shortest + height_second\n\n# Height of the tallest tree\nheight_tallest = 2 * combined_height\n\n# Output the height of the tallest tree\nprint(height_tallest)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will correctly calculate and print the height of the tallest tree.
