In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll first take note that there are 200 kids divided equally into boys and girls, so there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n\nKey idea: Each boy brings back 600 shells, so in total, the boys bring back \\(100 \\times 600\\) shells. Each girl brings back as many shells as one boy plus four times that amount. We aim to find out how many shells each girl brought back by solving this using Case 1 - a direct computation with Python.\n\nConsidering the problem statement:\n- Total shells brought by boys: \\(100 \\times 600\\)\n- To find the number of shells brought by the girls, note each girl brought back as many shells as one boy, plus four times more. We'll represent the number of shells brought by one girl with a variable and solve for it.\n\nLet's proceed with implementing this in Python code:\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy to handle symbolic calculations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the number of shells each girl brings\nshells_per_girl = symbols('shells_per_girl')\n\n# Number of shells each boy brought back\nshells_per_boy = 600\n\n# Equation: A girl brings back equal to one boy plus four times more = 5 times shells per boy\ntotal_shells_for_girls = shells_per_girl * 100\nequation = Eq(shells_per_girl, shells_per_boy + 4 * shells_per_boy)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, shells_per_girl)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThe Python code above defines a symbolic variable for the shells brought back by each girl, sets up an equation based on the problem's conditions, and solves for the number of shells each girl brought back. When you run this code, it will return the number of shells per girl using the specified conditions."
