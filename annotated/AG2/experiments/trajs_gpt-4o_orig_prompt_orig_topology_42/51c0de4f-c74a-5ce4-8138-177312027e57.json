  "problem": "Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

Calculate the total amount collected from neighbors and the online fund combined.\n2. Determine how much Walter's lawyer's donation amount corresponds to three times the total donation (excluding the friend's contribution).\n3. Subtract the combined amount of the donations from the lawyer's contribution to find the friend's contribution.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step reasoning in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total donations from neighbors and the online fund\nneighbors_donation = 500\nonline_fund_donation = 1500\ntotal_others_donation = neighbors_donation + online_fund_donation\n\n# Step 2: Set up the equation\n# Let x be the amount the friend gave\nx = symbols('x')\n# The lawyer donates three times the total of neighbors', online fund, and friend's donations\nlawyer_contribution = 6600\n\n# Equation: 3 * (total_others_donation + x) = lawyer_contribution\nequation = Eq(3 * (total_others_donation + x), lawyer_contribution)\n\n# Solve for x\nfriend_donation = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(friend_donation)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the amount Walter's friend gave him, which we'll put in the \\(\\boxed{}\\) notation once we have the result."
