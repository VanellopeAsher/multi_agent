You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarl purchases ten packages of biscuits.

Calculate the total number of biscuits.\n2. Find the total cost of the biscuits.\n3. Subtract the total cost from $10 to find the change.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to compute these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total number of biscuits\npackages = 10\nbiscuits_per_package = 6\ntotal_biscuits = packages * biscuits_per_package\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the biscuits\nprice_per_biscuit = Rational(1, 10)  # $0.10 in fraction form\ntotal_cost = total_biscuits * price_per_biscuit\n\n# Calculate the change from a $10 note\namount_paid = 10\nchange = amount_paid - total_cost\n\n# Print the change as a fraction\nprint(change)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the change Carl will receive after purchasing the biscuits.
