You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $15.00 each and a ballpen at $5.00 each.

This problem can be solved with Python code directly by calculating the total cost based on the number of notebooks and ballpens William purchased.\n\nWe need to calculate the total cost as follows:\n- Calculate the cost of the notebooks: number of notebooks times the price per notebook\n- Calculate the cost of the ballpens: number of ballpens times the price per ballpen\n- Sum the costs to get the total amount William spent.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Number and prices of items\nnum_notebooks = 50\nprice_per_notebook = 15.00\nnum_ballpens = 10\nprice_per_ballpen = 5.00\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = (num_notebooks * price_per_notebook) + (num_ballpens * price_per_ballpen)\n\n# Output the result using print and ensure it's shown in a proper format\nprint(f\"The total amount William spent is ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total amount William spent.
