You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

Therefore, we can determine that there are 10 boys and 10 girls. Each boy brings back 60 shells. The total number of shells collected by all boys is 10 * 60 = 600 shells. The total number brought back by all the girls is the same number of shells collected by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys collected. We need to calculate the number of seashells each girl collected.\n\nLet's write the program to find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Importing relevant library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define number of boys and girls\nnum_girls = 10\nnum_boys = 10\n\n# Seashells collected by each boy\nshells_per_boy = 60\n\n# Total shells collected by all boys\ntotal_boy_shells = num_boys * shells_per_boy\n\n# Let x be the number of shells brought by each girl\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total shells collected by all girls\n# Total shells collected by girls = Total shells collected by boys + 4.5 * total shells by boys\ntotal_girl_shells = total_boy_shells + 4.5 * total_boy_shells\n\n# So x * number of girls = total_girl_shells\neq = Eq(x * num_girls, total_girl_shells)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nshells_per_girl = solve(eq, x)[0]\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nOnce you run the code, it will give you the number of seashells each girl brought back."
