You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

The key idea is to express the number of cards each person has in terms of a single variable and then solve for that variable.\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step using Python:\n\n1. Let \\( P \\) represent the number of cards PJ has.\n2. Then Smendrick has \\( 4P \\) cards because Smendrick has 4 times the cards PJ has.\n3. Becca has \\( 4P + 15 \\) cards because Becca has 15 more than Smendrick.\n4. The sum of all these cards is 447, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nP + 4P + (4P + 15) = 447\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we have:\n\n\\[\n9P + 15 = 447\n\\]\n\n5. Solve for the number of cards Becca has.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python using sympy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nP = symbols('P')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(P + 4*P + (4*P + 15), 447)\n\n# Solve for the number of cards PJ has\nsolutions = solve(equation, P)\n\n# Calculate the number of cards Becca has\nP_value = solutions[0]\nBecca = 4*P_value + 15\n\n# Print the result\nprint(Becca)\n```\n\nUpon executing this code, we will find the number of cards Becca has."
