You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

We'll use the key idea of setting up the problem mathematically by calculating the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running during that week.\n\nHere's how we can tackle the problem:\n\n1. **Determine the total distance he runs per week:** According to the problem, John runs 60 miles a week.\n\n2. **Calculate the time spent running across 3 days:**\n   - First day: He runs for 3 hours.\n   - The other two days: He runs half as long as the first day, which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours each day.\n\n3. **Total time spent running:** Add up the time spent running on each day.\n\n4. **Calculate the running speed:** We can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n   \\]\n\nLet's write a Python code to calculate his speed in miles per hour.\n\n```python\n# Code to calculate John's running speed\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total distance John runs in a week\ntotal_distance = 60  # miles\n\n# Time spent running\ntime_first_day = 3  # hours\ntime_other_days = 1.5  # hours for each of the other two days\ntotal_time_running = time_first_day + 2 * time_other_days\n\n# Calculate speed using fraction\nspeed = Rational(total_distance, total_time_running)\n\n# Output John's running speed in miles per hour\nprint(f\"John's running speed is {speed} miles per hour\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us John's average running speed in miles per hour in fraction form."
