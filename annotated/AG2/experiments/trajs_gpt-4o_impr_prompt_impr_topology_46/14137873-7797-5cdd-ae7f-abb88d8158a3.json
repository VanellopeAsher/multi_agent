Let's define variables and set up equations based on the narrative.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the initial number of french fries in the packet.\n\n2. **Data Extraction and Initial Information:**\n   - Dave consumed 14 french fries.\n   - The seagull ate half the number Dave ate, which is \\( \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\) fries.\n   - So, after Dave and the seagull, the packet contains: \n     \\[\n     x - 14 - 7 = x - 21\n     \\]\n\n3. **Pigeons Contribute to Consumption:**\n   - Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, in total: \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) fries.\n   - Fries remaining after the pigeons ate:\n     \\[\n     x - 21 - 9 = x - 30\n     \\]\n\n4. **Raccoon Steal:**\n   - The raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries:\n   - If \\( y \\) represents the fries remaining at this point, then:\n     \\[\n     y = x - 30\n     \\]\n   - The raccoon took:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{3}y = \\frac{2}{3}(x - 30)\n     \\]\n   - The fries left after the raccoon visited:\n     \\[\n     y - \\frac{2}{3}y = \\frac{1}{3}y = \\frac{1}{3}(x - 30)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Ants and Final Count:**\n   - Ants took 1 fry, leaving 5 fries remaining:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5\n     \\]\n\n6. **Formulate and Solve the Equation:**\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x - 30 = 18\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 48\n     \\]\n\nThus, Dave initially purchased a packet containing 48 french fries."
