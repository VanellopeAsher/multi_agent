      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine Joey's and Marcy's current scores and then find the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score to see how much Joey is winning by.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Scores:**\n   - Joey's score before his turn: 214 points\n   - Marcy's score before her turn: 225 points\n\n2. **Points Scored:**\n   - Joey scores some points on his turn. Let \\( x \\) be the number of points he scores.\n   - Marcy scores 10 points on her turn.\n\n3. **New Scores:**\n   - Joey's new score: \\( 214 + x \\)\n   - Marcy's new score: \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\)\n\n4. **Determine How Many Points Joey is Winning By:**\n   To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = (214 + x) - 235\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 214 + x - 235 = x - 21\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Joey is winning by \\( x - 21 \\) points, where \\( x \\) is the number of points he scored during his turn. Without knowing the exact number of points Joey scored, this is the general expression for how much Joey is winning by. \n\nI suggest we now discuss this solution and verify if this approach aligns with everyone's calculations."
