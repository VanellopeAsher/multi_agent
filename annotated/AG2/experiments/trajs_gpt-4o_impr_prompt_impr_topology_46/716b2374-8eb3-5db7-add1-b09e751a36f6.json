He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each pack of cloths, given Kim's weekly income, profit, and expenses on bleach. \n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Clients**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Current clients} = 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Potential clients} = 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total clients assumed} = 3 + 5 = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Expense on Bleach**: \n   - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach, so the total number of bottles needed is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ clients} \\times 2 \\text{ bottles per client} = 16 \\text{ bottles}\n     \\]\n   - Since each bottle costs $2, the total bleach cost is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per bottle} = 32 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Establish the Relationship between Income, Profit, and Expenses**: \n   - Total expenses include both the cost of bleach and cloths.\n   - Profit is the difference between income and total expenses:\n     \\[\n     \\text{profit} = \\text{income} - \\text{expenses}\n     \\]\n   - Given that the profit is $20 and income is $92:\n     \\[\n     20 = 92 - \\text{expenses}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for expenses:\n     \\[\n     \\text{expenses} = 92 - 20 = 72\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Cost of Cloths**:\n   - The total expenses ($72) include both bleach ($32) and cloths.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the cost of one pack of cloths. Each client requires 1 pack, so:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ clients} \\times x = 72 - 32\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     8x = 40\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\), the cost of each pack of cloths:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{40}{8} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, each pack of cloths costs $5."
