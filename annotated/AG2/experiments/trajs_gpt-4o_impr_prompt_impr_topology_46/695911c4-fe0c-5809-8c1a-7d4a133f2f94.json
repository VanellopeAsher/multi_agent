A 150% increase on $10 would add \\(1.5 \\times \\$10 = \\$15\\) to the original cost, making the new cost per visit \\( \\$10 + \\$15 = \\$25\\).\n   - Total cost for 1 year after the increase = \\(3 \\text{ visits} \\times \\$25/\\text{visit} = \\$75\\).\n   - Total cost for 3 years after the increase = \\(3 \\text{ years} \\times \\$75/\\text{year} = \\$225\\).\n\n3. **Total cost over 13 years**:\n   - Total cost for the first 10 years: \\$300\n   - Total cost for the next 3 years: \\$225\n   - Total cost = \\$300 + \\$225 = \\$525\n\nTherefore, Pauline spent a total of \\$525 on all her visits to the museum over the 13 years."
