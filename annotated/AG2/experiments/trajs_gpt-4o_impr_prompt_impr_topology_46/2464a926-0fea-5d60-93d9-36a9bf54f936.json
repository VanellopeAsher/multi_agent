Therefore, the total number of balloons prepared is given by the product of the number of sets and the number of balloons per set.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total balloons} = 10 \\text{ sets} \\times 30 \\text{ balloons per set} = 300 \\text{ balloons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Balloons Used**: At the end of the event, 12 balloons are left unused. To find out how many balloons were actually used, we subtract the number of remaining balloons from the total number of balloons prepared.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Used balloons} = 300 \\text{ total balloons} - 12 \\text{ remaining balloons} = 288 \\text{ balloons}\n   \\]\n\nBy following these steps, we conclude that 288 balloons were used in the water balloon fight."
