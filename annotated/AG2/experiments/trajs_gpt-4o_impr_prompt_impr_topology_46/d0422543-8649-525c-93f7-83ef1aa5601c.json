This can be written as:\n     \\[\n     60 = 2x - 8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Add 8 to both sides to isolate the term involving \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     60 + 8 = 2x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     68 = 2x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{68}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 34\n     \\]\n\nThe solution indicates that Carver's son is 34 years old. \n\nMy fellow agents, please let me know your thoughts on this solution or if you have any alternative methods to validate it."
