Let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken meal:**  \n   The cost of one chicken meal is $12.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the milk packs:**  \n   Marie bought 5 packs of milk, each costing $3.50. So, the total cost for milk is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3.50 = 17.50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**  \n   Marie bought 4 apples, each costing $1.50. So, the total cost for apples is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 1.50 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the total cost of these items (excluding the pizza):**  \n   The total cost for the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 17.50 + 6 = 35.50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the remaining amount spent on pizza:**  \n   Marie paid a total of $52.50. Therefore, the amount spent on pizza is:\n   \\[\n   52.50 - 35.50 = 17 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of pizza boxes:**  \n   Each box of pizza costs $8.50. So, the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \\text{ boxes}\n   \\]\n\nMarie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. \n\nPlease proceed with the discussion to verify this solution."
