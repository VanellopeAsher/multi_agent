      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of students with desktop computers, those without, and the total number of students.\n\nStep 1: Define the Variables\n- Let \\( N \\) be the total number of students at that grade level.\n- Let \\( D \\) represent the number of students with a desktop computer.\n\nStep 2: Establish the Relationships\n- We know from the problem statement that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Therefore, \\( D = \\frac{3}{4}N \\).\n\nStep 3: Determine the Number of Students Without Computers\n- The number of students who do not have a desktop computer is \\( N - D \\).\n- Given that 20 students represent one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop, let \\( X \\) represent the total number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop. Then, one-third of \\( X \\) is 20.\n\nStep 4: Solve the Equation\n- From the above, we can write: \\( \\frac{1}{3}X = 20 \\).\n- Solving for \\( X \\), we multiply both sides by 3: \\( X = 60 \\).\n\nStep 5: Relate \\( X \\) to the Total Number of Students\n- The 60 students, \\( X \\), represent all the ones without either type of computer.\n- Thus, the number of students without a desktop computer is \\( N - D \\), which must also equal \\( X + \\) the number of students who have only laptops (which are counted in \"not desktop\").\n- We've already calculated that \\( N - D = N - \\frac{3}{4}N = \\frac{1}{4}N \\).\n\nSince \\( N - D = 60 \\), solving this gives:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}N = 60 \\]\n\\[ N = 60 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ N = 240 \\]\n\nSo, there are 240 students at that grade level.\n\nAgent Code Executor and Agent Verifier, do you agree with this solution? What are your thoughts?"
