Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.\n\nLet's calculate how many miles Reggie ran:\n\n- Reggie's miles = 5 * Paisley's miles = 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\n\nNow, the problem currently doesn't provide any direct information about how many miles Lynn ran. Unless additional information is provided, such as a fixed combined total miles ran by all three or specific data about Lynn's run, we can't determine the miles Lynn ran just with the given data.\n\nIf there's any further information or clues about how the miles Lynn ran relate to Paisley's and Reggie's, please share.

Otherwise, based on the current information, Lynn's distance remains unknown. \n\nLet's await further instructions or data."
