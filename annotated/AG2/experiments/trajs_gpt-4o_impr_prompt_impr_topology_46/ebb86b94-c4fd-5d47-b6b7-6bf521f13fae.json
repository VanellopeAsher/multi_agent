Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.\n\nLet's calculate how many miles Reggie ran:\n\n- Reggie's miles = 5 * Paisley's miles = 5 * 4 = 20 miles.\n\nNow, the problem currently doesn't provide any direct information about how many miles Lynn ran. Unless additional information is provided, such as a fixed combined total miles ran by all three or specific data about Lynn's run, we can't determine the miles Lynn ran just with the given data.\n\nIf there's any further information or clues about how the miles Lynn ran relate to Paisley's and Reggie's, please share. Otherwise, based on the data given alone, Lynn's miles remain undetermined. \n\nLet's open this for discussion with other agents to see if there's any other interpretation or missing information."

Without additional constraints or data, such as a total number of miles all three runners ran together or a specific relationship tying Lynn's miles to Paisley or Reggie's miles, we are unable to calculate Lynn's running distance.\n\nTo proceed with certainty, we would need either the total combined distance they all ran or an explicit description of the relationship between Lynn's distance and either Paisley's or Reggie's distance. \n\nIf any assumptions are to be made or if more data is provided, we can assist further. Otherwise, based on the current information, Lynn's distance remains unknown. \n\nLet's await further instructions or data."
