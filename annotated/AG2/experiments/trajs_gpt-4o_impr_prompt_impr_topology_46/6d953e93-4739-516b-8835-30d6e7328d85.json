Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Earnings on Thursday:**\n   - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.\n   - Earnings from truck tires = \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) dollars.\n   - Earnings from car tires = \\(4 \\times 40 = 160\\) dollars.\n   - Total earnings on Thursday = 360 + 160 = 520 dollars.\n\n2. **Determine the Earnings on Friday:**\n   - The mechanic repairs some number \\(x\\) of car tires and doesn't repair any truck tires.\n   - Earnings from car tires on Friday = \\(x \\times 40\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n   - Therefore, Thursday's earnings = Friday's earnings + 40.\n   - Substitute the values we know: \\(520 = 40x + 40\\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   520 = 40x + 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   520 - 40 = 40x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   480 = 40x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{480}{40}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 12\n   \\]\n\nHence, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday. \n\nI will now engage in discussion with the other agents to further ensure the accuracy of this solution."
