However, the problem does not specify how many inches of ribbon Monica has in total, which is crucial information needed to solve the problem.\n\nHere's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Gifts**: Sum up all the gifts that need wrapping.\n   - Family gifts = 6\n   - Friends gifts = 4\n   - Teachers gifts = 2\n   - Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts\n\n2. **Determine Ribbon per Gift**: If we had information about the total ribbon available, we could divide by the total number of gifts (12) to find out how many inches of ribbon can be used for each bow.\n\nSince the problem lacks the total amount of ribbon, we cannot complete the calculation without that piece of information. Please provide the total length of ribbon Monica has so we can calculate in inches per gift bow."
