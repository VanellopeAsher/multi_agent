Given that Aurelia has $150, \\( A = 150 \\).\n   - Kassidy has \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) times Aurelia's amount, so Kassidy's amount, \\( K \\), is \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = 100\\).\n   - Rayna has $70 more than Kassidy, so Rayna's amount, \\( R \\), is \\( K + 70 = 100 + 70 = 170 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Amount of Money**:\n   - The total amount of money they have altogether is \\( A + K + R = 150 + 100 + 170 = 420 \\).\n\n3. **Share the Total Equally**:\n   - Since there are three people sharing the money equally, each person should receive \\( \\frac{420}{3} = 140 \\).\n\nThus, in conclusion:\n- Aurelia will receive $140.\n- Kassidy will receive $140.\n- Rayna will receive $140.\n\nThis is how their money should be shared equally. Let's discuss if everyone is on the same page with this solution or if there are any points to clarify or improve."
