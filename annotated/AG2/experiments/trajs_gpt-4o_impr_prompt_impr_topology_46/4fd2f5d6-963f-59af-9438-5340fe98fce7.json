This is because:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost (DIY)} = \\text{Professional Cost} \\times (1 - 0.20) = \\text{Professional Cost} \\times 0.80\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Cost:**\n   - If we need to calculate the exact numeric total cost, we need to know the professional cost or cost details related to materials, but these details are not provided.\n\nGiven this outline and the current information, additional details (like professional cost or absolute material costs) would be required to compute an exact numeric answer. However, essentially, any professional expense Ethan might have avoided is factored in as a 20% cost reduction in our calculation model.\n\nNow, I'll open the discussion to other agents for further insights in case there are other perspectives or assumptions to consider."

This means that if a professional service would have cost, let's say, $X, Ethan's cost by doing it himself would be $0.8X (or 80% of the professional cost).\n\nIn order to find the total cost of the DIY project, we'd ideally need to know the professional cost or at least the cost of materials, to deduct it from the standard 100% cost and understand how much was saved.\n\nSuppose we don't have the professional cost, $X, or the cost of materials; we can only determine relationships or ratios like in the above deduction but can't give an exact absolute cost amount without such baseline references or specifics.\n\nAgent Code Executor, could you confirm from the calculation that our interpretation is correct or suggest a way to calculate with hypothetical costs?

Then Ethan saves 20% by doing it DIY:\n\n1. **Calculate the DIY cost in terms of $X**:\n   - DIY Cost = Professional Cost * (1 - Savings Percentage) = $X * 0.80\n\nWe can write a Python script that calculates Ethan's total cost for any given professional cost. Without the specific professional cost, this calculation will remain theoretical, demonstrating the relationships between the values.\n\n```python\n# Hypothetical professional cost\nprofessional_cost = 100  # For demonstration purposes, you can choose any value\n\n# Calculate Ethan's total cost with 20% savings\ntotal_diy_cost = professional_cost * 0.80\n\n# Print the calculated result\nprint(total_diy_cost)\n```\n\nThis code calculates and displays Ethan's total cost with a hypothetical professional cost of $100. You can replace this number with any other value. The outcome will consistently be 80% of the professional cost specified. \n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to execute this demonstration or provide additional explanation!"

Let's consolidate:\n\nThe problem intrinsically relies on two variables: the professional service cost and the resultant cost after saving through DIY. The latter is given as a percentage of the former, but without knowing the initial professional cost (or any other specific numerical value related to materials or service), it remains impossible to determine the actual cost Ethan incurred.\n\nBoth Problem Solver and Code Executor have verified that:\n- DIY saves 20%, meaning the total cost Ethan spent would equate to 80% of hiring a professional.\n- Without explicit numerical values, any attempt to solve will not yield a definitive cost, merely indicating relational data.\n\nThus, given the absence of any initial professional cost or materials cost, we conclude:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**\n\nThis reflects the inability to discern an exact monetary value without additional provided context."
