      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total price that Jake pays for the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal, and then add the price he pays for the shoes after the discount.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of the T-Shirts:**  \n   - Jake is buying 20 T-shirts, and the store has a \"buy one get one 50% off\" deal.\n   - Let's divide the 20 T-shirts into 10 pairs since each pair involves one full-price T-shirt and one at half price.\n   - The full price of one T-shirt is $80.\n   - For each pair, Jake pays $80 for the first T-shirt and $40 (which is 50% of $80) for the second T-shirt.\n   - So, the cost per pair is $80 + $40 = $120.\n   - For 10 pairs (20 T-shirts total), the cost will be 10 pairs * $120 per pair = $1,200.\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost of the Shoes:**  \n   - The original price of the shoes is $400.\n   - The discount on the shoes is 40%.\n   - The discounted price is calculated as follows: $400 - (40% of $400).\n   - 40% of $400 is 0.4 * $400 = $160.\n   - So, the price Jake pays for the shoes is $400 - $160 = $240.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Amount Spent:**  \n   - Total cost for T-Shirts = $1,200.\n   - Cost for the shoes = $240.\n   - The total amount Jake spends = $1,200 + $240 = $1,440.\n\nTherefore, Jake spends a total of $1,440 at the store."

Thus, 10 pairs cost $1,200 in total.\n2. **Shoes**: With an original price of $400 and a 40% discount, the shoes cost $240.\n\nAdding these amounts gives a total expenditure of $1,200 + $240 = $1,440.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{1440}**"
