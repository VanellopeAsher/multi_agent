Then, the inequality representing the condition is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve the Inequality**: \n   To find \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the inequality by \\( x \\) and divide both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   60 \\leq 10x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 6\n   \\]\n\n   This implies Manny must attend at least 6 classes.\n\n7. **Determine Classes Manny Can Miss**:\n   If there are 10 classes total, and Manny must attend at least 6 classes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Classes Manny can miss} = 10 - 6 = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10."
