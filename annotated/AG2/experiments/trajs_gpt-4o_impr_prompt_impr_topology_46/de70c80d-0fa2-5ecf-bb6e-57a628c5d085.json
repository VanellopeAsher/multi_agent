Each time she writes the full alphabet, she writes 26 letters, since there are 26 letters in the alphabet.\n\n    - First full alphabet: 26 letters\n    - Second full alphabet: 26 letters\n    - Third full alphabet: 26 letters\n\n   Therefore, in the initial phase, she writes: \n\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 26 = 78 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Half Alphabet Writing**: After writing the full alphabet three times, she writes half of the alphabet once more. Half of the alphabet would consist of the first 13 letters (A to M).\n\n    - Half alphabet: 13 letters\n\n3. **Rewriting Everything**: After the initial and half writings, Elise rewrites everything she has written so far. This means she rewrites the full amount she has written in the previous steps, which is 78 letters (full alphabets) + 13 letters (half alphabet).\n\n    - Total letters written before rewriting: \\(78 + 13 = 91\\) letters\n\n    - She rewrites these 91 letters once more: \n\n    \\[\n    91 \\text{ letters rewritten}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Total Letters Written**: Therefore, the total number of letters Elise writes is the sum of her initial writings (91 letters) plus the rewriting (91 letters):\n\n    \\[\n    91 + 91 = 182 \\text{ letters}\n    \\]\n\nThus, in total, Elise has written **182 letters**."
