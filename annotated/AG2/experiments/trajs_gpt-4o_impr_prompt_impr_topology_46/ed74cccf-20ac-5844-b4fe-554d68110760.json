      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of students participating in all the activities (tennis, volleyball, and soccer). Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Tennis Players:**\n   - We are told there are 6 students playing tennis.\n\n2. **Volleyball Players:**\n   - The number of volleyball players is twice the number of tennis players.\n   - Therefore, the number of volleyball players = 2 * 6 = 12.\n\n3. **Soccer Players:**\n   - It is given that there are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer.\n   - Since the exact number of boys is not provided, we cannot determine the precise number of soccer players unless additional information is given (such as the total number of boys).\n   - However, for the purpose of finding total participants and assuming all students can be accounted by known values and unknown boys, the variable representing boys cannot be zero since they differentiate between boys and girls in soccer.\n\n4. **Total Number of Students:**\n   - Total students = Tennis players + Volleyball players + Soccer players.\n   - Total = 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + (22 + number of boys) (soccer).\n\nWithout the exact number of boys, there is no numerical solution. However, the expression for the total number of students is:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = 6 + 12 + 22 + \\text{(number of boys)} = 40 + \\text{(number of boys)}. \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of students depends on the number of boys playing soccer, given by the expression \\(40 + \\text{number of boys}\\). Let's discuss the approach or if anyone has a solution involving the number of boys if additional information is provided."

I'll write a simple Python function with SymPy that calculates this. \n\nWe will create a symbolic representation for the number of boys and provide an expression to calculate the total number of students based on the constraint we established. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the symbol for the number of boys\nboys = symbols('boys')\n\n# Tennis players\ntennis_players = 6\n\n# Volleyball players (twice the number of tennis players)\nvolleyball_players = 2 * tennis_players\n\n# Soccer players (22 girls plus the number of boys)\nsoccer_players = 22 + boys\n\n# Total students\ntotal_students = tennis_players + volleyball_players + soccer_players\n\n# Display the result as an expression\nprint(total_students)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

The expression \\(40 + \\text{boys}\\) accounts for all given information, which reflects the structure needed to find the total number of students given additional information on the number of boys.\n\nTherefore, since the problem's core requirement for providing an exact numerical answer cannot be addressed due to the lack of specific data on the number of boys, the expression derived is the best form of answer we can provide.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = 40 + \\text{number of boys}\\]\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{\\text{boys} + 40}**"
