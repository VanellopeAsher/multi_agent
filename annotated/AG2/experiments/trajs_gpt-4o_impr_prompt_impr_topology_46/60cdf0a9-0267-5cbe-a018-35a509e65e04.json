Thus, the total number of crayons (or small pieces in this context) is:\n\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 64 = 192 \n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Muffin Crayons**:\n\n   If each muffin crayon is made from 8 small pieces, then the total number of muffin crayons made is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{192}{8} = 24 \n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Price of Each Muffin Crayon**:\n\n   Kate sold all her muffin crayons and made $36 in total. Therefore, the selling price per muffin crayon is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$36}{24} = \\$1.50\n   \\]\n\nSo, each muffin crayon sells for $1.50. \n\nNext, let's discuss this calculation."
