      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n    - Let \\( x \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n    - Let \\( y \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n\n2. **Relate Large and Small Animal Sales**:\n    - According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Therefore, we can write the equation \\( y = 2x \\).\n\n3. **Define Small Stuffed Animals Pricing**:\n    - Each small stuffed animal costs $40.\n\n4. **Define Large Stuffed Animals Pricing**:\n    - Large stuffed animals are priced at three times the price of small ones. Hence, each large stuffed animal costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Revenue**:\n    - The total revenue from selling the small stuffed animals is \\( 40y \\).\n    - The total revenue from selling the large stuffed animals is \\( 120x \\).\n    - Together, the total revenue from both kinds of sales is given in the problem as $1200, which gives the equation:\n      \\[\n      40y + 120x = 1200\n      \\]\n\n6. **Substitute \\( y = 2x \\) in the Revenue Equation**:\n    - Substitute for \\( y \\) in the revenue equation:\n      \\[\n      40(2x) + 120x = 1200\n      \\]\n    - Simplify this equation to find \\( x \\):\n      \\[\n      80x + 120x = 1200 \\\\\n      200x = 1200 \\\\\n      x = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n      \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the Number of Small Stuffed Animals Sold**:\n    - We know \\( y = 2x \\). Therefore, substitute \\( x = 6 \\):\n      \\[\n      y = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n      \\]\n\nSo, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. \n\nLet's discuss if everyone agrees with this approach or if anyone has other ways of tackling the problem."
