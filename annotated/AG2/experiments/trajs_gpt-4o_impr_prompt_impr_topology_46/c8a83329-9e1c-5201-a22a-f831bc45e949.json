      "content": "To determine how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we'll break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Erica's Initial Cards**: Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.\n2. **Additional Cards from Dad**: Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. We need to know how many cards are in each box to add this to her total. However, this detail is missing, so we'll denote the number of cards per box as \\( x \\). Therefore, she received \\( 2x \\) additional cards.\n3. **Cards Passed Out**: Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. This is a total of \\( 24 + 5 = 29 \\) cards passed out.\n4. **Cards Erica Received**: Erica received 17 cards from her family and friends.\n\n**Calculation of Remaining Cards:**\n- Total cards Erica initially had including the ones from her dad: \\( 20 + 2x \\).\n- Cards Erica has after passing out: \n  \\[\n  (20 + 2x) - 29\n  \\]\n- Cards received from family and friends:\n  \\[\n  (20 + 2x) - 29 + 17\n  \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \n20 + 2x - 29 + 17 = 8 + 2x\n\\]\n\nThus, Erica currently has \\( 8 + 2x \\) Valentine's Day cards. To find the exact number, the number of cards per box \\( x \\) must be provided."
