Griffin initially had 30 fries.\n\n2. **Kyle took 6 fries** from Griffin, leaving Griffin with:\n   \\[\n   30 - 6 = 24 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle**, so he took:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n   Now Griffin has:\n   \\[\n   24 - 12 = 12 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Colby took 3 less fries than the number Kyle took**, so he took:\n   \\[\n   6 - 3 = 3 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n   Before considering Ginger's input, Griffin has:\n   \\[\n   12 - 3 = 9 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n\n5. **In the end, Griffin has 33 fries**, which means Ginger gave him enough fries in addition to his remaining fries to reach 33:\n   Let \\( x \\) represent the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.\n\n   Since Griffin ended up with 33 fries, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   9 + x = 33\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 33 - 9 = 24\n   \\]\n\nHence, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries. \n\nLet me know if this reasoning aligns with your own or if there are questions we could discuss further."
