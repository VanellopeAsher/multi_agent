The number of boys is indeed 10, and each collects 60 shells, bringing the total for boys to 600.\n2. The girls collect an amount equal to what the boys collected plus four and a half times that amount. So:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total for girls} = 600 + 4.5 \\times 600 = 600 + 2700 = 3300\n   \\]\n\n3.
