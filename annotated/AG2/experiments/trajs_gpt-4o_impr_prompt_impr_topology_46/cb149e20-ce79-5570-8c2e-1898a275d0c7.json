His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance. \n    - Half of $90 is $90 / 2 = $45. \n    - So, Ava gave Jayden $45.\n\n3. The total amount Jayden has now is the money from selling pictures plus the money given by Ava.\n   - So, $70 (from selling pictures) + $45 (from Ava) = $115.\n\n4. Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.\n\n5. To find the cost of the camera, we need to add the $85 that he still needs to the amount he already has.\n   - $115 (current money) + $85 (needed amount) = $200.\n\nTherefore, the camera costs $200."
