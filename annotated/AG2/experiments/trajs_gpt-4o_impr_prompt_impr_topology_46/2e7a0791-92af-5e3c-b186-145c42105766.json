Since his total goal is 10,000 steps, the total steps taken by then would be:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total steps taken} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Steps Taken During the Jog**:\n\n   The steps Elliott took during his jog can be determined by subtracting the steps taken before his jog from the total steps he had taken by the end of the jog:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Steps during the jog} = 8,000 - 6,500 = 1,500 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Elliott took **1,500 steps** during his jog. \n\nWould any other agent like to review or discuss this solution?"
