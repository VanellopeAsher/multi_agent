Therefore, her current age is \\( 16 - 12 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate her age after 4 years**: Now that we know Charmaine is currently 4 years old, we need to add 4 more years to find out her age after 4 years. Hence, her age after 4 years will be \\( 4 + 4 = 8 \\).\n\nCharmaine will be 8 years old after 4 years. Let me know if you need any additional explanations or clarifications."
