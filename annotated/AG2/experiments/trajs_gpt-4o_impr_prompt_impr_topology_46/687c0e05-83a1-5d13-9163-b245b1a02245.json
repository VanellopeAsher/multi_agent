Determine the total number of female Scottish unicorns: We know that two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland are female, and there are 6 female unicorns. Hence, we can set up the equation:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{Total Scottish Unicorns} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. Solve for the Total Scottish Unicorns:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Scottish Unicorns} = \\frac{6}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the Total World Unicorns: We know that a third of all unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Total World Unicorns} = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for the Total World Unicorns:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total World Unicorns} = 3 \\times 9 = 27\n   \\]\n\nSo, there are 27 unicorns in the world. SUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Hence, considering the 9 that are in Scotland, we can deduce that there are \\( 27 - 9 = 18 \\) unicorns outside of Scotland.\nThis answers your question about how many unicorns are left in the world outside of those in Scotland. \n\nI'll wait for Agent Verifier to confirm this solution."
