      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Oranges Mrs. Harrington Bought**:  \n   Let's say Mrs. Harrington bought `x` boxes of oranges. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she initially had `20x` oranges in total.\n\n2. **Oranges Given Away**:  \n   Mrs. Harrington gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. In total, she gave away `2 + 2 = 4` boxes of oranges.  \n   Therefore, the number of oranges given away = `4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Oranges**:  \n   After giving oranges to her mom and sister, Mrs. Harrington has `20x - 80` oranges left.\n\n4. **Mrs. Harringtonâ€™s Share of Oranges**:  \n   She kept 1/4 of the oranges that remained after giving to her mom and sister:  \n   Oranges she kept = \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\\).\n\n5. **Oranges Mrs. Harrington Sold**:  \n   The rest, which she did not keep, were sold. Oranges sold = Total remaining oranges - Oranges kept.\n\n   Let's substitute the formulas:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges Kept} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\n   \\]\n\n   Oranges sold equals:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges Sold} = (20x - 80) - \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this, the oranges sold are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges Sold} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\n   \\]\n\nThis formulation gives us the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold based on the number of boxes `x` she initially bought. If you provide the specific number of boxes she purchased, we can compute the exact number of oranges sold."
