However, because a fellow actor is absent, Sean has to memorize 15 lines.  \n     So, even though he originally had \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\) lines, due to the absence of an actor, this number is now explicitly given as 15 lines instead of calculated lines.\n\n4. **Total Lines Memorized by Sean:**  \n   Sum of lines Sean has to memorize:\n   - Lyrics to the solo song: 54 lines\n   - Lines in the first scene: 36 lines\n   - Lines in the second scene: 15 lines (as per the situation with the absent actor)\n\nAdding them up, Sean has to memorize a total of:\n\\[ 54 + 36 + 15 = 105 \\]\n\nThus, Sean has to memorize 105 lines in total."
