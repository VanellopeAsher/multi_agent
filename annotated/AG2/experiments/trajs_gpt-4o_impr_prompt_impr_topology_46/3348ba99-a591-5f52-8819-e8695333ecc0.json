Thus, we convert the number of questions:\n\\[ \n\\frac{105 \\text{ questions}}{10 \\text{ questions per set}} = 10.5 \\text{ sets}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mark left 10.5 sets of ten questions incomplete."

Let me walk you through my approach to solving this problem using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Initial data\nquestions_per_set = 10\nrate_of_completion_per_hour = 0.5 * questions_per_set  # questions per hour\n\n# Test 1\ntest1_sets = 7.5\ntime_for_test1 = 0.8 * 10  # in hours\ntotal_questions_test1 = test1_sets * questions_per_set\nquestions_completed_test1 = time_for_test1 * rate_of_completion_per_hour\nincomplete_questions_test1 = total_questions_test1 - questions_completed_test1\n\n# Test 2\ntest2_sets = 10\ntime_for_test2 = 0.6 * 10  # in hours\ntotal_questions_test2 = test2_sets * questions_per_set\nquestions_completed_test2 = time_for_test2 * rate_of_completion_per_hour\nincomplete_questions_test2 = total_questions_test2 - questions_completed_test2\n\n# Total incomplete questions\ntotal_incomplete_questions = incomplete_questions_test1 + incomplete_questions_test2\nincomplete_sets = total_incomplete_questions / questions_per_set\n\ntotal_incomplete_questions, incomplete_sets\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- For Test 1:\n  - Calculate the total number of questions (7.5 sets × 10 questions/set).\n  - Calculate how many questions Mark can complete in the given time (0.8 sets of hours × 10 hours/set).\n  - Subtract the completed questions from the total questions to find the incomplete ones.\n\n- Similarly for Test 2:\n  - Calculate the total number of questions (10 sets × 10 questions/set).\n  - Calculate the number of questions completed in the available time (0.6 sets of hours × 10 hours/set).\n  - Subtract the completed questions from the total questions to find the incomplete ones.\n\nFinally, sum the incomplete questions from both tests and convert them into sets by dividing by 10.\n\n### Running the code gives us:\n- `total_incomplete_questions` should be 105,\n- `incomplete_sets` should thus be 10.5.\n\nSo, Mark left 105 questions or 10.5 sets of ten questions incomplete.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10.5}"
