First, calculate the cost of 1 notebook and 2 ballpens:\n   \\[\n   1.50 + (2 \\times 0.50) = 2.50\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the pencil case costs:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost**:  \n   Add up all the individual costs:\n   \\[\n   7.50 (notebooks) + 0.50 (ballpen) + 5.00 (pencil case) = 13.00\n   \\]\n\nThus, William spent a total of $13.00. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT STEPS: Discussion and Verification with Agent Verifier."

Cost of 5 notebooks:\n   - Each notebook costs $1.50.\n   - Total for 5 notebooks: \\(5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50\\).\n\n2. Cost of 1 ballpen:\n   - Ballpen costs $0.50.\n   - Total for 1 ballpen: \\(0.50\\).\n\n3.
