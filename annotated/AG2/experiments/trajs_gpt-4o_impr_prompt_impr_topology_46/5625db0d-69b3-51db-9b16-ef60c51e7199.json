      "content": "To solve this problem, I will calculate the total cost of the apples for both Clara and Sheila and then find the difference between the two totals. Here’s how we approach it step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Clara’s Total Cost\n- Clara bought 15 apples, each costing $15.\n- Without any discounts, the cost for Clara is \\(15 \\times 15 = \\$225\\).\n- She had a voucher that gave her $3 off, so her final cost was \\( \\$225 - \\$3 = \\$222 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Sheila’s Total Cost\n- The next day, apples cost $25 each. Sheila bought 15 apples.\n- Without any discounts, the cost for Sheila is \\(15 \\times 25 = \\$375\\).\n- On the day Sheila bought the apples, there was a 15% discount.\n- To find the discount amount Sheila received, we calculate 15% of $375:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Discount} = 0.15 \\times 375 = \\$56.25  \n  \\]\n- Therefore, Sheila’s final cost after the discount is:  \n  \\[\n  375 - 56.25 = \\$318.75  \n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Difference in Final Costs\n- Clara’s final cost: $222\n- Sheila’s final cost: $318.75\n- The difference in the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:  \n  \\[\n  318.75 - 222 = \\$96.75  \n  \\]\n\nThus, the difference between the final prices paid for the apples on the two days is $96.75. \n\nI will now open the floor for discussion to see if there are alternative approaches or additional insights."
