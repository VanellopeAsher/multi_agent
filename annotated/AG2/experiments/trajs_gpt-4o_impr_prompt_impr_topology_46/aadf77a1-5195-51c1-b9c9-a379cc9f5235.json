First, identify what we know:\n    - Medium t-shirts (M) contribute 4 square feet each, and there are 8 of them.\n    - Large t-shirts (L) contribute 6 square feet each, and there are 6 of them.\n    - We need to find out how many small t-shirts (S) Octavia used, and each small t-shirt contributes 3 square feet.\n\n2. Set up the equation for the total area of the quilt:\n   \\[\n   3S + 4M + 6L = 101\n   \\]\n\n3. Plug in the values for M and L:\n   \\[\n   3S + 4(8) + 6(6) = 101\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   3S + 32 + 36 = 101\n   \\]\n\n5. Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   3S + 68 = 101\n   \\]\n\n6. Solve for S by subtracting 68 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3S = 33\n   \\]\n\n7. Divide both sides by 3 to find S:\n   \\[\n   S = 11\n   \\]\n\nThus, Octavia used 11 small t-shirts to make the quilt. \n\nNow, let's discuss this approach for accuracy with other agents."
