      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many apples each sister gathered individually, before deriving how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Joanne's Apple Gathering:**\n   - Apples from the tallest trees: Joanne gathers 30 apples.\n   - Apples from the shortest trees: Joanne gathers half this amount, which is \\(\\frac{30}{2} = 15\\) apples.\n   - Apples from the average trees: Joanne gathers 350 apples.\n   - Total apples Joanne gathers: \n     \\[\n     T_J = 30 + 15 + 350 = 395\n     \\]\n\n2. **Joanne's Sister's Apple Gathering:**\n   - Apples from the tallest trees: Her sister gathers twice as many as Joanne, giving us \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\) apples.\n   - Let the number of apples her sister gathers from the shortest trees be \\(x\\).\n   - Her sister doesn't gather any from the average trees.\n\n3. **Combined Total Apple Gathering:**\n   - According to the problem, the two gather a combined total of 500 apples.\n   - Thus, the equation for the total apples is:\n     \\[\n     395 + 60 + x = 500\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     455 + x = 500\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     x = 500 - 455 = 45\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Multiplicative Factor for the Shortest Trees Gathering:**\n   - Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees.\n   - Her sister gathered 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n   - To find how many times as many apples her sister gathered compared to Joanne:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Factor} = \\frac{45}{15} = 3\n     \\]\n\nHence, Joanne's sister gathered apples from the shortest trees 3 times as many as Joanne."
