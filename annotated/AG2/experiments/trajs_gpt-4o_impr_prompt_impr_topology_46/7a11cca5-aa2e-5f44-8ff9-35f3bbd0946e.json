Hence, the water volume on day two is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Identify Water Volume on Day Three**:  \n   - On the third day, the water volume is given as 14,000 gallons.\n\n4. **Calculate Increase in Water Volume from Day Two to Day Three**:  \n   - The increase in water volume from day two to day three is:\n     \\[\n     14000 - 8000 = 6000 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe increase in the water volume on the third day is 6000 gallons. \n\nNext, I'll engage in a discussion with the other agents to verify and ensure the accuracy of this solution."
