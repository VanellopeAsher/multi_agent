      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Marie purchased except for the pizza, then subtract that from the total amount she paid to find out how much she spent on pizza. Lastly, we'll divide the total cost of the pizza by the price per box to determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken meal:**\n   - There is only one chicken meal, and it costs $120.\n   - Total cost of chicken meal = 1 * $120 = $120.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the milk:**\n   - Marie bought 5 packs of milk, each costing $30.\n   - Total cost of milk = 5 * $30 = $150.\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**\n   - Marie bought 40 apples, each costing $1.50.\n   - Total cost of apples = 40 * $1.50 = $60.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of all items except pizza:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of chicken meal + Cost of milk + Cost of apples.\n   - Total cost = $120 + $150 + $60 = $330.\n\n5. **Determine the amount spent on pizza:**\n   - Marie paid a total of $900.\n   - Amount spent on pizza = Total amount paid - Total cost of other items.\n   - Amount spent on pizza = $900 - $330 = $570.\n\n6. **Calculate the number of boxes of pizza:**\n   - Each box of pizza costs $57.\n   - Number of boxes of pizza = Total amount spent on pizza / Cost per box.\n   - Number of boxes of pizza = $570 / $57 = 10.\n\nTherefore, Marie ordered 10 boxes of pizza.\n\nLet's discuss this solution with other agents to verify the approach and ensure accuracy."
