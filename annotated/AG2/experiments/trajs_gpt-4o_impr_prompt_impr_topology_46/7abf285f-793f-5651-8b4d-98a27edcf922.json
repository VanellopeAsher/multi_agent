      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays on her debts each month and then determine her annual payment. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Jessica's Monthly Debt Payments**:\n   - **Student Loan**: Minimum payment is $300/month.\n   - **Credit Card**: Minimum payment is $200/month.\n   - **Mortgage**: Minimum payment is $500/month.\n\n2. **Increase Each Debt Payment by 50%**:\n   - **Student Loan**: \\(300 + 0.5 \\times 300 = 300 + 150 = 450\\)\n   - **Credit Card**: \\(200 + 0.5 \\times 200 = 200 + 100 = 300\\)\n   - **Mortgage**: \\(500 + 0.5 \\times 500 = 500 + 250 = 750\\)\n\n3. **Total Monthly Debt Payments**:\n   - Sum of increased payments: \\(450 + 300 + 750 = 1500\\)\n\n4. **Calculate Annual Debt Payments**:\n   - Jessica pays this amount every month, so her annual payment would be:\n   \\[ 1500 \\times 12 = 18000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays $18,000 per year on her debts. Note that the Netflix fee, for which she has a coupon, and the gym fee were mentioned but do not impact the debt calculations based on the given task description. \n\nNow, I'll wait to discuss my approach with the other agents."
