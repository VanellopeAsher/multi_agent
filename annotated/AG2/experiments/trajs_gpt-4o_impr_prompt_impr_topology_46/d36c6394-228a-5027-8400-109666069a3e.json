The number of new passengers is 5 times the number who got off:\n     \\( 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\).\n   \n   - Adding these new passengers, the total number of passengers is:\n     \\( 40 + 40 = 80 \\).\n\n   - Before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again:\n     \\( 80 - 2 = 78 \\).\n\n3. **Second Stop**:\n   - 21 passengers get off the bus:\n     \\( 78 - 21 = 57 \\).\n   \n   - 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means \\(\\frac{21}{3} = 7\\) passengers get on.\n\n   - Updating the total number of passengers:\n     \\( 57 + 7 = 64 \\).\n\nAfter systematically going through each step, we find that there are 64 passengers riding the bus after the second stop."
