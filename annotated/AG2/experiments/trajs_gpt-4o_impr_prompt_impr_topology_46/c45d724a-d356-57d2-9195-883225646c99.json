The total cost for the notebooks is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of notebooks} = 50 \\times 15 = 750 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Calculating the Cost of Ballpens**\n1.

The total cost for the ballpens is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of ballpens} = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Calculating the Total Cost**\n1.
