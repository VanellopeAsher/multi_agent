      "content": "To solve this problem, let's determine the number of squares for each color, based on the information given, and then calculate how many fewer white squares there are than green squares.\n\n1. **Red Squares**:  \n   Brittany's comforter has 14 red squares.\n\n2. **Blue Squares**:  \n   There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18 blue squares.\n\n3. **Green Squares**:  \n   There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24 green squares.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Known Squares**:\n   The total number of the known colored squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares  \n   = 14 (Red) + 18 (Blue) + 24 (Green) = 56 squares.\n\n5. **Total Squares on the Comforter**:\n   The comforter is 68 square feet, which implies it has 68 squares in total, as there is 1 square per square foot.\n\n6. **Calculate White Squares**:\n   Total white squares = Total squares on the comforter - Total known colored squares  \n   = 68 (total) - 56 (known colored) = 12 white squares.\n\n7. **Determine How Much Fewer White Squares Are Compared to Green Squares**:\n   Green squares are 24, and white squares are 12. Hence, white squares are 24 - 12 = 12 fewer than green squares.\n\nTherefore, the white squares are 12 fewer than the green squares."
