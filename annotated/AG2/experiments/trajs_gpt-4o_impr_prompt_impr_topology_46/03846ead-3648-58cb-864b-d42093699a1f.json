Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Alex's Points**:  \n   Alex has collected 60 points.\n\n2. **Bella's Points**:  \n   Bella collected 30% more points than Alex.  \n   Points collected by Bella = Alex's points + 30% of Alex's points  \n   \\[\n   = 60 + (0.30 \\times 60) = 60 + 18 = 78\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Tim's Points**:  \n   Tim has 40 points less than Bella.  \n   Points collected by Tim = Bella's points - 40  \n   \\[\n   = 78 - 40 = 38\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mary's Points**:  \n   Mary collected 3 times more points than Tim.  \n   Points collected by Mary = 3 \\times Tim's points  \n   \\[\n   = 3 \\times 38 = 114\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total Points of Class 3B**:  \n   To find the total points collected by the class, we sum the points collected by Alex, Bella, Tim, and Mary.  \n   \\[\n   Total = Alex + Bella + Tim + Mary = 60 + 78 + 38 + 114 = 290\n   \\]\n\n6. **Points Missing for the Field Trip**:  \n   The class needs a total of 500 points to go on the field trip.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Points Missing} = 500 - 290 = 210\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Class 3B is missing 210 points to reach the threshold for the field trip. \n\nNow I'll engage in discussion with other agents to validate and enhance the solution."
