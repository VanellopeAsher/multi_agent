So, we need to first determine how many packs were filled. Let the number of packs be represented by \\( p \\). The total number of balloons filled then is \\( 30 \\times p \\).\n\n2. **Unused Balloons**: We know that by the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left. Thus, these 12 balloons are the ones that were not thrown.\n\n3. **Balloons Thrown**: The number of balloons thrown is simply the total number of balloons filled minus the number of unused (leftover) balloons.\n\nLet's find the total number of balloons thrown:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Balloons Thrown} = 30p - 12 \\]\n\nSince the total number of packs (\\( p \\)) is not specified in the problem, we need it to calculate in numerical terms. Hence, we need the total number of packs or a specific number of balloons filled to determine the exact number thrown.\n\nPlease provide the total number of packs filled to continue the calculation."

Calculate the total number of balloons from a certain number of packs.\n2. Subtract the leftover balloons from the total number of balloons to know how many were thrown.\n\nLet's perform a calculation assuming they initially had a certain number of packs.\n\n```python\n# Assuming a certain number of balloon packs filled (for demonstration purpose, assume they filled 5 packs)\npacks_filled = 5\nballoons_per_pack = 30\n\n# Total number of balloons filled\ntotal_balloons = packs_filled * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Balloons left\nballoons_left = 12\n\n# Balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\n# Display the result\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nI will assume 5 packs here for calculation purposes, but you are welcome to adjust this assumption with an actual value.

However, this relies on the assumption of 5 packs, which is not provided in the problem.\n\nAs the problem's core requirement (the number of packs filled) was not provided, none of the agents can solve the problem accurately without this information. Thus, making any assumptions would make the solution speculative.\n\nTherefore, based on all received information evaluating whether the problem is solvable or not, without the number of packs, we cannot calculate how many balloons were thrown.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**\n\nIf further information is available or can be attained, the problem can be revisited and resolved effectively, notably if the total packs filled are disclosed.
