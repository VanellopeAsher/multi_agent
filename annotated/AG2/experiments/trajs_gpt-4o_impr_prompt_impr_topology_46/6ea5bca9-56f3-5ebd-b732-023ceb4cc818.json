Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Variables:**\n\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the number of hundreds of cards Becca has.\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the number of hundreds of cards Smendrick has.\n   - Let \\( P \\) represent the number of hundreds of cards PJ has.\n\n2. **Formulate the Equations Based on the Problem Statement:**\n\n   - Becca has 0.12 hundred more cards than Smendrick:\n     \\[\n     B = S + 0.12\n     \\]\n\n   - Smendrick has 3 times more the cards than PJ:\n     \\[\n     S = 3P\n     \\]\n\n   - Total cards (in hundreds) held by all three:\n     \\[\n     B + S + P = 3.41\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute and Solve for the Variables:**\n\n   Substitute \\( B = S + 0.12 \\) and \\( S = 3P \\) into the total equation:\n   \\[\n   (S + 0.12) + S + P = 3.41\n   \\]\n\n   Replace \\( S \\) and \\( P \\) with \\( S = 3P \\):\n   \\[\n   (3P + 0.12) + 3P + P = 3.41\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   7P + 0.12 = 3.41\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   7P = 3.41 - 0.12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7P = 3.29\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{3.29}{7} = 0.47\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Smendrick's and Becca's Cards:**\n\n   - \\( S = 3P = 3 \\times 0.47 = 1.41 \\)\n   - \\( B = S + 0.12 = 1.41 + 0.12 = 1.53 \\)\n\n5. **Convert to Individual Counts (Not Just Hundreds):**\n\n   Since each number is in hundreds, Becca has \\( 1.53 \\times 100 = 153 \\) cards.\n\nThus, Becca has 153 Magic Cards. \n\nLet's now discuss this solution with other agents."
