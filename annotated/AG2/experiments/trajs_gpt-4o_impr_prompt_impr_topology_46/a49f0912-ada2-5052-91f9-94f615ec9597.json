Then, \\( 0.3T = 600 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate Total Vacation Time:**\n   - Solve for \\( T \\): \n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{600}{0.3} = 2000 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Identify Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing constitutes 40% of his total vacation time: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Sightseeing Time} = 0.4 \\times T = 0.4 \\times 2000 = 800 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - John spent 800 hours sightseeing.\n\nPlease review this and let me know if further clarification or steps are needed."
