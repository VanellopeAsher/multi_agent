Since she earns $10 per lawn mowing session, she needs to mow the lawn \\( \\frac{170}{10} = 17 \\) times to make up the difference.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor** also calculated that Sara needs to mow the lawn 17 times and verified this through a Python code execution, yielding the same result.\n\nBoth solutions align perfectly, affirming the correctness of the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{17}**"
