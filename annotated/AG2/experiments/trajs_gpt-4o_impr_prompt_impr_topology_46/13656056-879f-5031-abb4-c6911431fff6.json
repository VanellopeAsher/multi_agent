Total earnings for the week: \\( 300 \\, \\text{dollars/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 2100 \\, \\text{dollars} \\)\n\n2. Amount left after spending: \\( 2100 \\, \\text{dollars} - 1000 \\, \\text{dollars} = 1100 \\, \\text{dollars} \\)\n\nTherefore, Gerald has $1100 left after spending $1000 from his weekly earnings."
