This is done by multiplying the price per gallon by the number of gallons purchased.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial cost} = 3.00 \\text{ (dollars/gallon)} \\times 10 \\text{ gallons} = 30.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cashback calculation:** Determine the total cashback for the purchase. This is calculated by multiplying the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons purchased.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cashback} = 0.20 \\text{ (dollars/gallon)} \\times 10 \\text{ gallons} = 2.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost after cashback:** Deduct the cashback from the initial cost to find the cost after cashback.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost after cashback} = 30.00 \\text{ dollars} - 2.00 \\text{ dollars} = 28.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Discount calculation:** Apply the 10% discount on the remaining cost after cashback. \n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \\times 28.00 \\text{ dollars} = 2.80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final cost:** Subtract the discount amount from the cost after cashback to get the final amount to be paid.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final cost} = 28.00 \\text{ dollars} - 2.80 \\text{ dollars} = 25.20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final amount to be paid for 10 gallons of gas, after both the cashback and the discount, is **$25.20.**\n\nLet's discuss and confirm if everyone agrees with the solution provided so far."
