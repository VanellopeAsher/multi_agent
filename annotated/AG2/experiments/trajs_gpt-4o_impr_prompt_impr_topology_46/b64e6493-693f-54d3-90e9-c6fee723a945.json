      "content": "To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents and then determine how many gumballs he can purchase with that amount, given that each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel).\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate the total value of coins in cents:**\n    - **Quarters**: Colby has 80 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of quarters is:\n      \\[\n      80 \\times 25 = 2000 \\text{ cents}\n      \\]\n    - **Dimes**: Colby has 60 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of dimes is:\n      \\[\n      60 \\times 10 = 600 \\text{ cents}\n      \\]\n    - **Nickels**: Colby has 140 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so the total value of nickels is:\n      \\[\n      140 \\times 5 = 700 \\text{ cents}\n      \\]\n    - **Pennies**: Colby has 150 pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so the total value of pennies is:\n      \\[\n      150 \\times 1 = 150 \\text{ cents}\n      \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total value of all coins:**\n   \\[\n   2000 + 600 + 700 + 150 = 3450 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of gumballs he can buy:**\n   - Each gumball costs 5 cents. Hence, the number of gumballs he can buy is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3450}{5} = 690 \\text{ gumballs}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Colby can buy 690 gumballs. \n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe problem was straightforward, involving simple arithmetic calculations to determine the total funds available and how they relate to the cost of the gumballs. If there are any other approaches or insights into this problem, or if any considerations were missed (such as potential errors in assumptions or operations), let's discuss!"
