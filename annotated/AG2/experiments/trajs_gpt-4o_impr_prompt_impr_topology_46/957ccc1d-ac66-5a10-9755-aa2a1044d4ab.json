This discrepancy likely arises from considering different numbers of days (Agent Code Executor's calculation accommodates for a leap year and also considers rounding precision).\n\nTo ensure complete consistency, let's verify again with precise date calculation:\n\n- From December 31, 2023, to July 19, 2024, a leap year, we have:\n  - January: 31 days\n  - February: 29 days (2024 being a leap year)\n  - March: 31 days\n  - April: 30 days\n  - May: 31 days\n  - June: 30 days\n  - July: 19 days\n  - Total: \\(31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 \\, \\text{days}\\)\n\nHence, the daily deficit calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Daily calorie deficit} = \\frac{105,000 \\, \\text{calories}}{201 \\, \\text{days}} \\approx 522.39 \\, \\text{calories/day}\n\\]\n\nThus, both the numerical results are consistently reasonable under their respective interpretations, and Agent Code Executor's execution aligns better with the given timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the verified and correct solution is:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{522.39}**"
