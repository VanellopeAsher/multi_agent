To find out how much ribbon she can allocate for each present, divide the total ribbon by the total number of presents:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ribbon per present} = \\frac{\\text{Total ribbon}}{\\text{Total presents}} = \\frac{144 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ presents}} = 12 \\text{ inches per present}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Monica can allocate 12 inches of ribbon for each present's bow. \n\nLet's discuss this in case there are other considerations or factors to include."
