Therefore, Jerry's share can be calculated by subtracting Richard's and Robert's cherries from the total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jerry's cherries} = 6000 - (3000 + 2000) = 1000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the difference in cherries between Robert and Jerry:**\n   To find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000\n   \\]\n\nThus, Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry."
