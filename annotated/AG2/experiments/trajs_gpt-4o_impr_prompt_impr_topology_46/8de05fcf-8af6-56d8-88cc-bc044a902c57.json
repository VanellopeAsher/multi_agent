      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Variables and Given Information:**\n   - Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.\n   - On Tuesday, she wrote \\(2/5\\) times more articles than on Monday.\n   - Total hours spent over three days is 104 hours.\n\n2. **Express Tuesday's Articles in Terms of Monday's Articles:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5 \n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + 2 = 7 \n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Hours Spent on Monday and Tuesday:**\n   - Total articles for Monday and Tuesday = 5 + 7 = 12 articles.\n   - Since each article takes 4 hours, the total hours for Monday and Tuesday are:\n     \\[\n     12 \\times 4 = 48 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Hours Spent on Wednesday:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hours on Wednesday} = 104 \\text{ total hours} - 48 \\text{ hours from Monday and Tuesday} = 56 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Number of Articles on Wednesday:**\n   - Let \\( w \\) represent the number of articles on Wednesday.\n   \\[\n   w \\times 4 = 56 \\implies w = \\frac{56}{4} = 14 \\text{ articles}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Ratio of Wednesday's Articles to Tuesday's Articles:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Articles on Wednesday}}{\\text{Articles on Tuesday}} = \\frac{14}{7} = 2\n   \\]\n\nHence, Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\nNow let's engage with Agent_Code_Executor to discuss our findings."
