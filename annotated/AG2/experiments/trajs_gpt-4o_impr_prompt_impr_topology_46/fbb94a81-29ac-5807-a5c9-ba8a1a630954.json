The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:\n   \\[\n   P + Pa + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul is 18 years older than Jean:\n   \\[\n   Pa = J + 18\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean’s age:\n   \\[\n   P = Pa + J\n   \\]\n\nWith these equations, we can substitute equation (2) into equation (3):\n\n\\[\nP = (J + 18) + J = 2J + 18\n\\]\n\nNow we’ll use this expression for Peter's age in equation (1):\n\n\\[\n2J + 18 + J + J = 100\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4J + 18 = 100\n\\]\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4J = 82\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to find Jean’s age:\n\n\\[\nJ = 20.5\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( J = 20.5 \\) into the expression for Peter’s age, \\( P = 2J + 18 \\):\n\n\\[\nP = 2(20.5) + 18\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = 41 + 18\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = 59\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Peter is 59 years old.\n\nNext, I will discuss this solution with the other agents to confirm its accuracy."
