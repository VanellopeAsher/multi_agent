Since it was 3 inches at the end of the first week, it grows to \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches by the end of the second week.\n\n3. **Third Week**:\n   - We know the beanstalk is 10 inches tall by the end of the third week.\n   - It was 6 inches at the end of the second week.\n   - The growth during the third week is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Height at the end of the third week} - \\text{Height at the end of the second week} = 10 \\text{ inches} - 6 \\text{ inches} = 4 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the beanstalk grew 4 inches during the third week."
