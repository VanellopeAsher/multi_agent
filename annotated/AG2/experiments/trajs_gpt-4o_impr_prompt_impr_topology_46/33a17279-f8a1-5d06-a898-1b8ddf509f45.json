Therefore, her earnings from cookies are:\n     \\[\n     80 \\text{ cookies} \\times \\$1/\\text{cookie} = \\$80\n     \\]\n   - She also sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each. Therefore, her earnings from cupcakes are:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ cupcakes} \\times \\$4/\\text{cupcake} = \\$240\n     \\]\n   - So, Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes are:\n     \\[\n     \\$80 + \\$240 = \\$320\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Expenses**:\n   - Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each. Thus, the total given to her sisters is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times \\$10 = \\$20\n     \\]\n   - She also donated $15 to a local charity.\n\n3. **Subtract Expenses From Earnings**:\n   - The total expenses (sisters + charity) are:\n     \\[\n     \\$20 + \\$15 = \\$35\n     \\]\n   - Finally, subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to determine how much money Suzanne has left:\n     \\[\n     \\$320 - \\$35 = \\$285\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Suzanne has $285 left from her earnings."
