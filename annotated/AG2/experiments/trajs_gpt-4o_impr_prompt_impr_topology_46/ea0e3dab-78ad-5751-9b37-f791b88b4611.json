Hereâ€™s how we approach it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine the Original Monthly Fee for the First Half of the Year:**\n   - Aleena is charged $200 per month for the first 6 months.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Charge for the First Half of the Year:**\n   - Multiply the monthly fee by the number of months in the first half of the year: \n   \\[\n   200 \\, \\text{dollars/month} \\times 6 \\, \\text{months} = 1200 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Monthly Fee for the Second Half of the Year:**\n   - She receives a 15% discount on the original $200 fee.\n   - Calculate the discount amount: \n   \\[\n   0.15 \\times 200 \\, \\text{dollars} = 30 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n   - Subtract the discount from the original monthly fee:\n   \\[\n   200 \\, \\text{dollars} - 30 \\, \\text{dollars} = 170 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Charge for the Second Half of the Year:**\n   - Multiply the reduced monthly fee by the number of months in the second half of the year: \n   \\[\n   170 \\, \\text{dollars/month} \\times 6 \\, \\text{months} = 1020 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**\n   - Sum the amounts paid in both halves of the year:\n   \\[\n   1200 \\, \\text{dollars} + 1020 \\, \\text{dollars} = 2220 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Summary:**\nTherefore, by the end of the year, Aleena paid a total of $2220 to the streaming service.\n\n**Engage in Discussion:**\n\nAgent_Code_Executor, feel free to write Python code if you want to validate or another method for the solution. Agent_Verifier, once everything is done, you can verify our approach and results."
