Let's denote the number of cougars killed last night as \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Understand Today's Actions**:\n   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today.\n   - Rick also killed three fewer cougars than he did last night.\n\n3. **Mathematical Representation of Today's Actions**:\n   - Denote the number of cougars Rick killed today as \\( c_{\\text{today}} \\).\n   - Since Rick killed three fewer cougars today than last night: \n     \\[\n     c_{\\text{today}} = c - 3\n     \\]\n   - For the wolves, since the number of wolves killed today is three times the cougars killed today:\n     \\[\n     w_{\\text{today}} = 3 \\times c_{\\text{today}}\n     = 3 \\times (c - 3)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Total Number of Animals Killed Today**:\n   - Today, the number of animals killed is the sum of cougars and wolves killed today.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total today} = c_{\\text{today}} + w_{\\text{today}}\n   = (c - 3) + 3 \\times (c - 3)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = (c - 3) + 3c - 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 4c - 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Summarize Total Animals Killed Over Both Days**:\n   - Since the total from last night was \\( 10 + c \\):\n   - The overall total number of animals killed over both days is:\n   \\[\n   (10 + c) + (4c - 12)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 5c - 2\n   \\]\n\nWithout loss of further clarifications on what \\( c \\) should be, this solution outlines how to analyze the problem with hypothetical variables to quantify Rick's actions mathematically.\n\nTo make the numerical conclusion about the specific total kills, further numerical information or assumptions about \\( c \\) are needed. \n\nLet's start a discussion based on this solution."

So, he killed (c - 3) cougars today.\n\n# Thus, the total wolves killed today is 3*(c - 3)\n\n# Total animals killed today is then:\n# (c - 3) cougars + 3*(c - 3) wolves = 4(c - 3)\n\n# Set up the equation for the total number of animals killed over both nights should equal a complete number:\n# Total = animals killed last night + animals killed today\n\ntotal_killed = (10 + c) + 4*(c - 3)\ntotal_killed_simplified = 5*c - 2\n\n# Since the total killed should be a positive integer, assume it equals something reasonable:\n# Let's assume the cougars killed initially (last night) was such that the formula yields a non-negative integer total\n\n# Example: Solve for when the total is a specific integer, such as when it's first positive:\nfor specific_total in range(0, 30):\n    equation = Eq(total_killed_simplified, specific_total)\n    cougar_last_night = solve(equation, c)\n    if cougar_last_night and cougar_last_night[0] > 0:\n        break\n\n# Display the evaluating result\nresult = (10 + cougar_last_night[0] + 4*(cougar_last_night[0] - 3)).evalf()\nprint(result)\n```\nI have processed the above code to solve for the number of cougars killed, by first assuming total killed results in a positive whole number and back-solving for the number of cougars.
