      "content": "To determine the number of bags the trader sold, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Definitions and Variables:**\n   - Let \\( n \\) be the number of bags of wheat.\n   - Purchase cost per bag is $20.\n   - Transport cost per bag is $2.\n   - Selling price per bag is $30.\n   - Total profit is given as $400.\n\n2. **Total Cost:**\n   - The total cost involved for the trader involves both the purchase and the transportation of the bags. Therefore, the total cost for all bags is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost} = n \\times (\\text{purchase cost per bag} + \\text{transport cost per bag}) = n \\times (20 + 2) = 22n\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Revenue:**\n   - The total revenue generated from selling all the bags is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Revenue} = n \\times \\text{selling price per bag} = 30n\n     \\]\n\n4. **Profit Equation:**\n   - Profit is defined as the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the total profit is $400. Hence, we write:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost} = 30n - 22n = 8n\n     \\]\n   - Set this equal to the given total profit:\n     \\[\n     8n = 400\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{400}{8} = 50\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
