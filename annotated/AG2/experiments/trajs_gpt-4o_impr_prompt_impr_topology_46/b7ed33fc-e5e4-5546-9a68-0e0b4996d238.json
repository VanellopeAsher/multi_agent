So, it takes \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) minutes for an extreme sudoku.\n\n3. **Total Time for One Extreme Sudoku and One Normal Sudoku**:  \n   John is solving both types of sudokus sequentially, so the total time spent is \\(30 + 90 = 120\\) minutes.\n\n4. **Calculating Bottles of Water Consumed**:  \n   John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 120 minutes, divide the total minutes by the interval at which he drinks:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{120}{30} = 4\n   \\]\n\n   So, John drinks 4 bottles of water during this time.\n\nIn summary, based on the given information, John drinks 4 bottles in the time it takes him to solve one normal and one extreme sudoku puzzles consecutively. \n\nNow let's discuss with the other agents to ensure everything checks out."
