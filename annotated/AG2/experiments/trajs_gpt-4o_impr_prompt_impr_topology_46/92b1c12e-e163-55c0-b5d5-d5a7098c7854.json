Let:\n   - \\( C \\) be Carver's age (given as 45 years).\n   - \\( D \\) be the daughter's age.\n   - \\( S \\) be the son's age.\n\n2. According to the problem, Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter:\n   \\[\n   C = 2D - 5\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute Carver's age:\n   \\[\n   45 = 2D - 5\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( D \\) (the daughter's age):\n   \\[\n   2D = 45 + 5 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2D = 50\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   D = 25\n   \\]\n\n5. The daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of the son:\n   \\[\n   D = 3S + 4\n   \\]\n\n6. Substitute \\( D = 25 \\) in the equation:\n   \\[\n   25 = 3S + 4\n   \\]\n\n7. Solve for \\( S \\) (the son's age):\n   \\[\n   3S = 25 - 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3S = 21\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = 7\n   \\]\n\nThus, the son is 7 years old. My solution indicates that the son is 7 years old. Let's discuss this to see if everyone agrees or has different approaches."
