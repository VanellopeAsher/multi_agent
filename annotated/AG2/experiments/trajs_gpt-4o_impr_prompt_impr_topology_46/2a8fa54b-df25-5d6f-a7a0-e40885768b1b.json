The mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by the total count of numbers.\n\n1. **Count the known scores:** Sally has 8 known scores and 1 unknown, making a total of 9 scores.\n\n2. **Calculate the sum for the known scores:** First, let's add up the known scores:\n   \\[\n   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up the equation with the mean:** The mean (average) score is given as 70. Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\frac{570 + x}{9} = 70\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( x \\) is the forgotten score.\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):** Multiply both sides of the equation by 9 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   570 + x = 630\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract 570 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 630 - 570\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 60\n   \\]\n\nThe forgotten score is 60.\n\nNow, let's discuss with the team for any alternate approaches or verifications."
