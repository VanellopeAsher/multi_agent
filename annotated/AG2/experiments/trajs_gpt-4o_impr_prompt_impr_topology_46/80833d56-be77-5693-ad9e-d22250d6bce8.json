Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Miles Run Per Week**:  \n   John runs a total of 100 miles per week.\n\n2. **Determine Time Spent Running Each Day**:  \n   - On the first day, John runs for 10 hours.\n   - On the second and third days, John runs half as much time as the first day, which is \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) hours each day.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Time Spent Running Per Week**:  \n   - Time spent on Day 1: 10 hours\n   - Time spent on Day 2: 5 hours\n   - Time spent on Day 3: 5 hours  \n   Total time = 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 hours\n\n4. **Calculate Average Speed**:  \n   Average speed = Total distance / Total time  \n   Average speed = 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 mph\n\nThus, John runs at an average speed of 5 miles per hour. \n\nI will now discuss this calculation with the other agents to ensure accuracy and see if there are additional perspectives or methods."
