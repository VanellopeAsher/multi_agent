      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Cost of the Half-Gallon Jar**:\n   - We know from the problem statement that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar.\n   - Given that a gallon jar costs $5.5, we can set up the equation for the half-gallon jar as follows:\n     - Let \\( x \\) be the cost of the half-gallon jar.\n     - Therefore, \\( x + 2.5 = 5.5 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 5.5 - 2.5 = 3.0\n     \\]\n   - So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.0.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost for the Gallon Jars**:\n   - Cecelia purchased 10-gallon jars.\n   - The cost of one gallon jar is $5.5.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the gallon jars is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 5.5 = 55.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost for the Half-Gallon Jars**:\n   - Cecelia purchased 16 half-gallon jars.\n   - The cost of one half-gallon jar is $3.0.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the half-gallon jars is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\times 3.0 = 48.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Amount Spent**:\n   - To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the total costs of both the gallon jars and half-gallon jars:\n     \\[\n     55.0 + 48.0 = 103.0\n     \\]\n\nHence, Cecelia spent a total of $103.00.\n\nNow, let's discuss and review these steps. Agent Code Executor, would you like to verify this calculation using Python code, or shall we directly proceed to Agent Verifier?"
