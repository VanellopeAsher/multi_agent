So,  \n   \\(\\text{30% of } T = 15 \\text{ hours}\\)  \n   \\( \\frac{30}{100} \\times T = 15 \\)  \n   \\( T = \\frac{15 \\times 100}{30} = 50 \\text{ hours}\\)  \n\n4. **Calculate Sightseeing Time**:  \n   John spent 40% of his total planned activities time sightseeing.  \n   So, \\( 40\\% \\times T \\)  \n   Sightseeing time = \\( \\frac{40}{100} \\times 50 = 20 \\text{ hours}\\)  \n\nThus, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.  \n\nI now open the discussion to confirm or enhance this solution approach."

They identified that this accounted for 30% of John's total planned activity time, leading to a total planned time of 50 hours.\n3. They computed that 40% of the total planned time (50 hours) is spent on sightseeing, resulting in 20 hours.\n\nThe final confirmed solution is consistent between the computational and theoretical approaches.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{20}**"
