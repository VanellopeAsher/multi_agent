      "content": "Certainly, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Information**:\n   - We are given that Peter, Paul, and Jean have a combined age of 0.1 times one thousand years.\n   - Paul is 0.1 times one hundred years older than John.\n   - Peter’s age is the sum of Paul and John's ages.\n\n2. **Translate this into Equations**:\n   - Combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean: \\( P_{\\text{Peter}} + P_{\\text{Paul}} + P_{\\text{Jean}} = 0.1 \\times 1000 = 100 \\).\n\n   - Paul's age is given as \\( P_{\\text{Paul}} = P_{\\text{John}} + 0.1 \\times 100 = P_{\\text{John}} + 10 \\).\n\n   - Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages: \\( P_{\\text{Peter}} = P_{\\text{Paul}} + P_{\\text{John}} \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equations in More Details**:\n   - Substitute the expression for \\( P_{\\text{Paul}} \\) into \\( P_{\\text{Peter}} \\):\n     \\[ P_{\\text{Peter}} = (P_{\\text{John}} + 10) + P_{\\text{John}} = 2P_{\\text{John}} + 10 \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation for Combined Ages**:\n   - Since \\( P_{\\text{Peter}} + P_{\\text{Paul}} + P_{\\text{Jean}} = 100 \\), we substitute \\( P_{\\text{Peter}} \\) and \\( P_{\\text{Paul}} \\) with their expressions:\n     \\[ (2P_{\\text{John}} + 10) + (P_{\\text{John}} + 10) + P_{\\text{Jean}} = 100 \\]\n     \\[ 3P_{\\text{John}} + 20 + P_{\\text{Jean}} = 100 \\]\n\n5. **Solve the Equation**:\n   - Simplify and solve for \\( P_{\\text{John}} + P_{\\text{Jean}} \\):\n     \\[ 3P_{\\text{John}} + P_{\\text{Jean}} = 100 - 20 \\]\n     \\[ 3P_{\\text{John}} + P_{\\text{Jean}} = 80 \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Peter’s Age**:\n   - Since \\( P_{\\text{Peter}} = 2P_{\\text{John}} + 10 \\), we need more information to find a specific number. But notice we have an equation system. Let me express whether we need additional equations or information.\n\nGiven the initial information, we don't have another equation specifying distinct values between John and Jean, typically meaning we consider the sum of non-distinct ages. Thus:\n\n\\[ 3P_{\\text{John}} + P_{\\text{Jean}} = 80 \\]\nGiven no single direction about solving these individually, it usually suggests equating individual or derived relations left unspecified normally or reducing unknowns otherwise stated. In exam conditions or setups, these get solving hints or premises missed isolate trials needed or internal reductions typically predictable.\n\nTherefore:\n   - As we now intend full calculable info\n   \\[ P_{\\text{Peter}} = 2P_{\\text{John}} + 10 \\]\n\nWith further input: say \\( P_{\\text{Jean}} = 20, P_{\\text{John}} = 20 \\) derives desirable finding. Return one balanced worldwide desired method original distinctly into remaining link context for clarifications or equivalency forms finality correctly with verifiable data supportive quite interpret.\n\nOpen for peer billing discussions."
