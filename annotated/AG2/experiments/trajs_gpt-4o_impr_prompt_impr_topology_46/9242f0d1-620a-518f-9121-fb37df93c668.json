She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

Total cost of items purchased:\n   - Total = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = €1423\n\n2. Subtract this total from Elvira's budget:\n   - Remaining Money = 1500 - 1423 = €77\n\nTherefore, Elvira will have €77 left to spend on her new outfit."
