Each sister is 16 years old.\n    - One of the brothers is 12 years old.\n    - The 12-year-old brother is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the age of the older brother is:\n      \\[\n      12 \\times 2 = 24 \\text{ years old}\n      \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Total Age**:\n    - The total ages of the 10 sisters (each 16 years old) can be calculated as:\n      \\[\n      10 \\times 16 = 160 \\text{ years}\n      \\]\n    - The ages of the two brothers (12 years and 24 years respectively) sum up to:\n      \\[\n      12 + 24 = 36 \\text{ years}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Adding the Total Ages**:\n    - Now, we add the total age of the sisters to the total age of the brothers:\n      \\[\n      160 + 36 = 196 \\text{ years}\n      \\]\n\nSo, the total age of all the siblings combined is 196 years."
