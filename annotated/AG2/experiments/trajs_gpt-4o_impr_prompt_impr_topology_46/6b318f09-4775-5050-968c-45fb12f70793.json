Calculate the number of people who couldn't attend due to illness:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the number of people who had previous commitments:\n   - 1/4 of those who couldn't attend due to illness:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n\n5. Calculate the total number of people who couldn't attend:\n   \\[\n   16 + 4 = 20 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n6. Calculate the number of people who will show up for the party by subtracting those who couldn't attend from the total invited:\n   \\[\n   132 - 20 = 112 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\nSo, 112 people will show up for Martha's party."
