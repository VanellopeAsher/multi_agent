The problem doesn't specify the exact height, so we'll refer to it as \\( h \\).\n\n2. **End of Second Week**: After the second week, the beanstalk doubles in height. Thus, the height of the beanstalk becomes \\( 2h \\).\n\n3. **End of Third Week**: In the third week, the beanstalk grows another 4 inches. Therefore, the height by the end of the third week will be the second week's height plus 4 inches. Thus, the height will be \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nSince we do not have the exact initial height (the height after the first week), we cannot calculate a numerical value for the beanstalk's height after three weeks. We can express the final height after three weeks in terms of the initial height:\n\n\\[ \\text{Height after 3 weeks} = 2h + 4 \\]\n\nThe problem requires knowing the initial height \\( h \\) to provide a complete numerical answer."
