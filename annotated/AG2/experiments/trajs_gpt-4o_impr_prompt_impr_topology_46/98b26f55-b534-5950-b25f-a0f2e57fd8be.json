      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Jordan spends playing video games each day, and then use that information to calculate his potential earnings if he spent that time working at his part-time job.\n\nHereâ€™s how we can calculate Jordan's earnings in a week:\n\n1. **Determine Daily Video Game Hours**: Identify the number of hours per day that Jordan spends playing video games. For example, let's assume he plays for \"x\" hours each day.\n\n2. **Calculate Weekly Hours**: Multiply the daily video game hours by 7 to determine how many hours he would work in a week instead of playing video games.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly Working Hours} = x \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Weekly Earnings**: Since Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, multiply the weekly working hours by this hourly rate to find his weekly earnings.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly Earnings} = (\\text{Weekly Working Hours}) \\times 10\n   \\]\n\nFor example, if he plays video games 2 hours per day, his weekly earnings would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly Earnings} = (2 \\times 7) \\times 10 = 14 \\times 10 = 140\n   \\]\n\n4. **Unit Verification**: Make sure the calculations are done in consistent units, all based on hours and dollars.\n\nOnce we have the value of \"x\", we can replace it in the equations above to get the precise weekly earnings. \n\nI suggest we now discuss if there are other factors we should include or clarify further assumptions."

Based on this assumption:\n\n- **Daily Video Game Time**: 3 hours\n- **Weekly Video Game Time (or Hours He Would Work)**: \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) hours\n\nNow, I will calculate how much money he would make if he worked those 21 hours at his part-time job earning $10 per hour. \n\nThis will provide us with Jordan's potential weekly earnings.
