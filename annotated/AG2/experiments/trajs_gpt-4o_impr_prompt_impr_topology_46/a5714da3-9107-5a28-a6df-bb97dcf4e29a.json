Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Cost of the Aquarium**: $10.00\n\n2. **Cost of the Rocks**:  \n   - She bought 2 bags of rocks, each costing $2.50.\n   - Total cost for rocks = 2 bags * $2.50/bag = $5.00\n\n3. **Cost of the Coral**:  \n   - She bought 3 pieces of coral, each costing $2.00.\n   - Total cost for coral = 3 pieces * $2.00/piece = $6.00\n\n4. **Cost of the Fish**:  \n   - The problem does not specify the cost of each fish. Assuming the fish were purchased at a fixed per-fish price, but since there is no given price, consider the fish price as $0.00 unless specified otherwise.\n\n5. **Cost of the Fish Food**: $2.00\n\n6. **Add Up All the Expenses**:  \n   Total spent = Cost of the aquarium + Cost of the rocks + Cost of the coral + Cost of fish (if specified) + Cost of the fish food  \n   Total spent = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $2.00 = $23.00\n\nTherefore, Scarlett spent a total of $23.00. \n\n(Note: If there is a price given for the fish that I need to account for, we can add that to our calculation as necessary)."
