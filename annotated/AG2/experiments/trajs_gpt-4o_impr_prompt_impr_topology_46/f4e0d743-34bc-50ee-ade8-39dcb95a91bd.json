We will add up the monthly expenses for each item and then calculate the total cost per year.\n\n1. **Weekly Food Costs**: $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is \\(4 \\times 25\\).\n2. **Monthly Treats Costs**: $20 per month.\n3. **Monthly Medicine Costs**: $100 per month.\n4. **Monthly Shampoo Costs**: $15 per month.\n5. **Toys Costs**: $10 every two months. This means $10 every 2 months, or $5 per month.\n\nNow we calculate the total monthly cost and then multiply it by the number of months in a year to get the annual cost.\n\n```python\n# Calculate monthly expenses\nweekly_food_cost = 25\nweeks_per_month = 4\nmonthly_food_cost = weekly_food_cost * weeks_per_month\n\nmonthly_treats_cost = 20\nmonthly_medicine_cost = 100\nmonthly_shampoo_cost = 15\n\n# Toy costs are $10 every two months, i.e., $5 per month\nmonthly_toy_cost = 10 / 2\n\n# Calculate total monthly costs\ntotal_monthly_cost = (monthly_food_cost + monthly_treats_cost + \n                      monthly_medicine_cost + monthly_shampoo_cost + \n                      monthly_toy_cost)\n\n# Calculate annual cost\nmonths_per_year = 12\ntotal_annual_cost = total_monthly_cost * months_per_year\n\nprint(total_annual_cost)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent_Code_Executor"

Since this implies one purchase per two months, the monthly equivalent cost is $5.\n   - Over a year, this adds up to \\(12 \\times 5 = 60\\) dollars.\n\nTo find the total expense for the year, we add all of these yearly costs together:\n\n- Total annual food cost: $1200\n- Total annual treats cost: $240\n- Total annual medicine cost: $1200\n- Total annual shampoo cost: $180\n- Total annual toy cost: $60\n\nAdding them up gives us the total annual expense: \\(1200 + 240 + 1200 + 180 + 60 = 2880\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Madeline spends $2,880 annually on her dog.\n\nAre there any further clarifications or checks you would suggest?"
