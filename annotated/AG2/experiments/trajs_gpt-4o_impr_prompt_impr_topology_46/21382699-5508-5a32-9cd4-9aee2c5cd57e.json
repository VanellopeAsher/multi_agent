We need to calculate what Allen's age will be in 10 years.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations**:\n   - Let Darrell's age be \\(7x\\).\n   - Let Allen's age be \\(11x\\).\n\n   According to the problem, their total age is given by:\n   \\[\n   7x + 11x = 162\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\)**:\n   - Simplify the equation: \n     \\[\n     18x = 162\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{162}{18} = 9\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Determine Current Ages**:\n   - Darrell's age is \\(7x = 7 \\times 9 = 63\\).\n   - Allen's age is \\(11x = 11 \\times 9 = 99\\).\n\n5. **Calculate Allen's Age in 10 Years**:\n   - Allenâ€™s age in 10 years will be:\n     \\[\n     99 + 10 = 109\n     \\]\n\nThus, Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years."
