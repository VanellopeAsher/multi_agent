Let’s break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Number of Kids**: There are 200 kids in total.\n2. **Division into Groups**: They were divided equally into girls and boys, which means there are:\n   - 100 boys\n   - 100 girls\n\n3. **Seashells Collected by Boys**:\n   - Each boy collected 600 seashells.\n   - Therefore, the total number of seashells collected by boys = 100 boys × 600 seashells per boy = 60,000 seashells.\n\n4. **Seashells Collected by Girls**:\n   - The total number of seashells brought by the girls is equal to the number collected by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\n   - Therefore, the total number of shells collected by the girls = 60,000 (collected by boys) + 4 × 60,000 = 300,000 seashells.\n\n5. **Seashells Collected by Each Girl**:\n   - Since 100 girls collected a total of 300,000 seashells, the number of seashells brought by each girl equals:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000\n   \\]\n\nHence, each girl collected 3,000 seashells. \n\nLet's move on to discussion to make sure everything is clear and verify the solution."
