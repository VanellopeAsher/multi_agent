First, convert all heights to the same unit. Since we want the answer in feet, we will later convert our final answer from inches to feet. However, for all calculations, let's work with inches first.\n\n2. Let \\( h_4 \\) be the height of the fourth child in inches. We are given that \\( h_4 = 72 \\) inches.\n\n3. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. Therefore, the height of the third child \\( h_3 \\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   h_3 = h_4 - 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h_3 = 72 - 3 = 69 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. The third child is five inches shorter than the second child. Thus, the height of the second child \\( h_2 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   h_2 = h_3 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h_2 = 69 + 5 = 74 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n5. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. Thus, the height of the first child \\( h_1 \\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   h_1 = h_2 - 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h_1 = 74 - 2 = 72 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n6. Finally, convert the height of the first child from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot:\n   \\[\n   h_1 = \\frac{72}{12} = 6 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the first child is 6 feet tall."

The fourth child is 72 inches tall.\n2. The third child is 3 inches shorter than the fourth child, which makes them 69 inches tall.\n3. The second child is 5 inches taller than the third child, which makes them 74 inches tall.\n4.
