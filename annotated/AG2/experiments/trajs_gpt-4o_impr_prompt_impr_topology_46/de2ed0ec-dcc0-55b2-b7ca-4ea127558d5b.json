      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the information we have about the fourth child to find the height of the first child.\n\n1. First, convert all heights to the same unit. Since we want the answer in feet, we will later convert our final answer from inches to feet. However, for all calculations, let's work with inches first.\n\n2. Let \\( h_4 \\) be the height of the fourth child in inches. We are given that \\( h_4 = 72 \\) inches.\n\n3. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. Therefore, the height of the third child \\( h_3 \\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   h_3 = h_4 - 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h_3 = 72 - 3 = 69 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. The third child is five inches shorter than the second child. Thus, the height of the second child \\( h_2 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   h_2 = h_3 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h_2 = 69 + 5 = 74 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n5. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. Thus, the height of the first child \\( h_1 \\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   h_1 = h_2 - 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h_1 = 74 - 2 = 72 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n6. Finally, convert the height of the first child from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot:\n   \\[\n   h_1 = \\frac{72}{12} = 6 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the first child is 6 feet tall."

Let's evaluate the proposed solutions:\n\nBoth agents started with the known height of the fourth child (72 inches) and worked backward through the problem to find the height of the first child.\n\n1. The fourth child is 72 inches tall.\n2. The third child is 3 inches shorter than the fourth child, which makes them 69 inches tall.\n3. The second child is 5 inches taller than the third child, which makes them 74 inches tall.\n4. Finally, the first child is 2 inches shorter than the second child, making them 72 inches tall.\n\nBoth agents correctly converted the height from inches to feet by dividing by 12:\n\\[\n72 \\div 12 = 6 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nBoth agents concluded that the height of the first child is 6 feet. Given that both the logic and calculations align correctly with the problem statement and both agents arrive at the same conclusion, I am confident in declaring the final solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{6}**"
