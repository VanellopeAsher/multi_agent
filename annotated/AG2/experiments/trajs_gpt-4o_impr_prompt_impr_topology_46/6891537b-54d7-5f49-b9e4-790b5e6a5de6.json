Therefore, the total number of basketball cards is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ basketball cards}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Baseball Cards**: Miss Maria has 5 boxes, each containing 40 baseball cards. Therefore, the total number of baseball cards is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 40 = 200 \\text{ baseball cards}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Cards**: The total number of both basketball and baseball cards is:\n   \\[\n   150 + 200 = 350 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cards Miss Maria Keeps**: Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.\n\n5. **Cards Given to Students**: After keeping 50 cards, the number of cards Miss Maria distributes is:\n   \\[\n   350 - 50 = 300 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Cards for Each Student**: Each student receives 10 cards.\n\n7. **Number of Students**: To find the number of students, divide the total number of cards distributed by the number of cards each student receives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300}{10} = 30\n   \\]\n\nThus, Miss Maria has 30 students who received cards.\n\n**Engage in Discussion**:\n\nMy solution outlines the calculation for determining Miss Maria's number of students based on the given card distributions. Please let me know if there are additional factors or if further validation is needed."
