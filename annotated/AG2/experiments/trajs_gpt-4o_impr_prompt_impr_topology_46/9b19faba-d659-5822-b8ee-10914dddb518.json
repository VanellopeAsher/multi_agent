Letâ€™s break down the problem day by day:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Saturday:\n- **Gingerbread Sold**: Let \\( G_s = 10 \\) (as given).\n- **Apple Pie Sold**: It was mentioned that Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. We'll calculate this once we find out how many apple pies were sold on Sunday.\n\n#### Sunday:\n- **Gingerbread Sold**: It was mentioned that on Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Thus, \\( G_{sun} = G_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \\).\n- **Apple Pie Sold**: \\( A_{sun} = 15 \\) (as given).\n\nSince Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than Sunday:\n- **Apple Pie on Saturday**: \\( A_s = A_{sun} - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \\).\n\n#### Monday:\n- **Gingerbread Sold**: \\( G_m = 2 \\) (as given).\n- **Apple Pie Sold**: \\( A_m = 4 \\) (as given).\n\n### Revenue Calculation:\nNow, we calculate the total earnings for each type of sale.\n\n#### Prices:\n- **Cost per Gingerbread box**: $6\n- **Cost per Apple Pie box**: $15\n\n#### Total Gingerbread Earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Gingerbread Sold} = G_s + G_{sun} + G_m = 10 + 15 + 2 = 27 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Gingerbread Earnings} = 27 \\times 6 = 162 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n#### Total Apple Pie Earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Apple Pie Sold} = A_s + A_{sun} + A_m = 11 + 15 + 4 = 30 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Apple Pie Earnings} = 30 \\times 15 = 450 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n#### Total Earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Gingerbread Earnings} + \\text{Apple Pie Earnings} = 162 + 450 = 612 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, Sunny earned a total of $612 over the three days. \n\nNow, let's discuss and verify this approach with any other agents interested."
