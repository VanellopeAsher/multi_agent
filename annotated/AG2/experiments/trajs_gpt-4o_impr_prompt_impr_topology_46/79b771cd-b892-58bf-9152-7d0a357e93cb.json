Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and whether this distance places her outside the reach of the dragon's flames.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Determine Polly's Throwing Distance with the Gemstone**:\n   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin up to 4000 feet.\n   - Holding the sapphire gemstone triples this distance. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Throwing Distance with Gemstone} = 3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Safe Distance**:\n   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 10,000 feet.\n   - Polly can throw the javelin 12,000 feet with the gemstone.\n   - To find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the flames and still hit the dragon, calculate:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Extra Distance} = \\text{Throwing Distance with Gemstone} - \\text{Dragon's Flame Reach} = 12000 - 10000 = 2000 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Polly can stand 2000 feet beyond the reach of the dragon's flames and still successfully hit the dragon with the gold javelin."

      "content": "The problem involves determining how far Polly could be outside of the dragon's reach when she can throw a javelin with the sapphire gemstone. The key calculation here is:\n\n1. **Throwing Distance with the Sapphire Gemstone**:\n   - Without the gemstone: 4000 feet.\n   - With the gemstone, it becomes three times further: \\(3 \\times 4000 = 12000\\) feet.\n\n2. **The Dragon's Fire Reach**: \n   - This is 10000 feet.\n\n3. **Distance Outside Dragon's Reach**:\n   - Since Polly can throw the javelin up to 12000 feet with the gemstone while the dragon's reach is only 10000 feet, Polly can stand \\(12000 - 10000 = 2000\\) feet outside of the dragon's flame reach and still manage to hit the dragon.\n\nSo, the maximum distance Polly can stand away from the dragon's reach while still being effective is 2000 feet.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2000}**"
