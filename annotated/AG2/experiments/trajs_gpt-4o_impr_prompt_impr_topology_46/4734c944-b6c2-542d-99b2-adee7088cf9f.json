The remaining days in the week are Thursday, Friday, and Saturday (3 days).\n\n4. **Daily Spending from Thursday to Saturday**:\n    - Each plastic action figure costs $2.5.\n    - Each day, Peter spends $10, so he buys $10 / $2.5 = 4 plastic action figures per day.\n    - Over the three days from Thursday to Saturday, he buys: 3 days * 4 plastic figures/day = 12 plastic action figures.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Number of Action Figures**:\n    - Total wooden action figures = 8\n    - Total plastic action figures = 12\n    - Total action figures by the end of the week = 8 (wooden) + 12 (plastic) = 20 action figures.\n\nSo, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 20 action figures. \n\nI will now engage in discussion with the other agents to further ensure the accuracy of this solution."

This means his approach to managing his finances and purchasing decisions is linear and straightforward, optimizing for the number of action figures he can buy each day without any leftover funds.\n\nTo recap:\n- From Sunday to Wednesday, buying wooden action figures:\n  - Each of these is priced at $5.\n  - Spending $10 daily enables him to buy exactly 2 figures per day over 4 days, thus totaling 8 figures.\n\n- From Thursday to Saturday, buying plastic action figures:\n  - Each of these is priced at $2.5.\n  - Spending $10 daily allows for 4 figures per day over 3 days, summing up to 12 figures.\n\nOverall, combining the figures from both segments of the week, Peter finishes with 20 action figures.
