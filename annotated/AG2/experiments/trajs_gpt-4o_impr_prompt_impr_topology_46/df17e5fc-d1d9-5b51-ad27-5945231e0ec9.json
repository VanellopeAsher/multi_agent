This means:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yellow Paint} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Total Paint Volume} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Paint for Other Colors**: The remaining paint, which is for red, white, and purple, is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Paint for Red, White, and Purple} = 12 - 6 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equally Divide Remaining Paint**: Since the remaining paint is equally distributed among red, white, and purple, we can calculate the pints for each color by dividing the 6 pints by the 3 colors:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Red Paint} = \\text{White Paint} = \\text{Purple Paint} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the mural used 2 pints of red paint. \n\nI'm ready to discuss this approach or review other possible solutions with the team."
