This is $1100.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total after savings} = 2100 + 1100 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract Expenditures**: Subtract the amounts spent on the comic book and the puzzle:\n\n   - First, subtract the $500 for the comic book:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total after comic book} = 3200 - 500 = 2700\n     \\]\n\n   - Next, subtract the $1900 for the puzzle:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total after puzzle} = 2700 - 1900 = 800\n     \\]\n\n4. **Result**: Therefore, the amount of money Raymond has left after all transactions is $800.\n\nThis plan outlines how to manually calculate the remaining amount of money step-by-step using basic arithmetic operations. Let me know if you need any more assistance or verification of this calculation!"
