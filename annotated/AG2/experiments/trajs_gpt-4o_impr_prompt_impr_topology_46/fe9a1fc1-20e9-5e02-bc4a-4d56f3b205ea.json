Therefore, based on the calculations and nearest rounding:\n\nKatarina might have counted 68 cookies individually - hence, the fractional part might indicate overestimation - we stick close to significant digits for the question.\n\nTotal approximate (considering practical rounding down/up where applicable): 287 cookies.\n\n**Discussion is open to verify and re-evaluate based on practical application and interpretation.**"
