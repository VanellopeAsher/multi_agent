Since 15 hours is 30% of this time, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.30x = 15\n   \\]\n   - Solving for \\(x\\), we divide both sides by 0.30:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   - This means he spent a total of 50 hours on his vacation.\n\n4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - The time spent sightseeing would be the total vacation time minus the time spent on the other activities:\n   - Sightseeing time = Total vacation time - Time spent on the listed activities\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sightseeing time} = 50 - 15 = 35 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, John spent 35 hours sightseeing. Let's now discuss the solution to ensure accuracy and completeness."

Based on the information that this accounts for 30% of his total vacation time, they determined that John spent a total of 50 hours on vacation, which leaves 35 hours for sightseeing.\n\n- **Agent Code Executor** used a Python script to confirm the calculations, arriving at the same conclusion: 35 hours spent on sightseeing.\n\nBoth agents have reached the same conclusion through different methodologies.
