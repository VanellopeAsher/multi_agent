We know that 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein.\n2. John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day.\n\nFirstly, we calculate how much protein is in the 300 grams of mushrooms John eats each day:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Protein in 300g of mushrooms} = \\frac{300 \\text{ grams}}{150 \\text{ grams}} \\times 4 \\text{ grams of protein} = 8 \\text{ grams of protein per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily protein consumption by 7 (days):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly protein intake} = 8 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 56 \\text{ grams/week}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John consumes **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{56}** grams of protein from mushrooms per week."
