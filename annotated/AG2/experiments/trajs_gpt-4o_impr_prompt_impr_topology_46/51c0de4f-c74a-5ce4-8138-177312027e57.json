      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount donated by everyone else, i.e., the sum Walter's neighbors and the online fund contributed. Then, we can use this information to determine the amount donated by Walter's friend, given that Walter's lawyer contributed three times as much as everyone else.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Donations (Without the Lawyer):**\n   - Walter collected $500 from his neighbors.\n   - Walter collected $1500 from his online fund.\n   - Total amount collected by Walter from neighbors and fund = $500 + $1500 = $2000.\n\n2. **Total Contributions by Everyone (Neighbors + Fund + Friend):**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the amount donated by Walter's friend.\n   - The total donations including Walter's friend = $2000 + \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Lawyer's Contribution:**\n   - The problem states the lawyer donates three times as much as everyone else combined.\n   - Therefore, the lawyer's donation = 3 * (Total contributions by others) = $6600, according to the problem.\n\n4. **Form the Equation:**\n   - Set up the equation based on lawyer's condition:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (2000 + x) = 6600\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - Divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   2000 + x = 2200\n   \\]\n   - Subtract 2000 from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 2200 - 2000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 200\n   \\]\n\nThus, Walter's friend contributed $200. \n\nWould you like to discuss this solution?"
