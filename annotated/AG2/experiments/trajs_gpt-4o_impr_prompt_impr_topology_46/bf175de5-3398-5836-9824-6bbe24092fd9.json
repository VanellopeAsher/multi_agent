Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine Individual Work Rate**:\n   - A single individual can paint half a house in 5 days.\n   - Therefore, the rate of work for one person is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) house in 5 days.\n\n2. **Calculate Full House Paint Time for One Person**:\n   - If \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) house takes 5 days, then painting a full house (i.e., 1 house) will take 5 days \\(\\times\\) 2 = 10 days for one person.\n\n3. **Convert Days to Hours**:\n   - There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days equals \\( 10 \\times 24 = 240 \\) hours.\n   - A single person would take 240 hours to paint the entire house.\n\n4. **Calculate the Team Work Rate**:\n   - If one individual takes 240 hours to paint the house, 5 individuals working together can divide the work among them.\n   - Therefore, 5 individuals would take \\( \\frac{240}{5} = 48 \\) hours to complete the painting together, assuming they work concurrently and efficiently share the workload.\n\nThus, it will take a team of 5 individuals 48 hours to paint the entire house."
