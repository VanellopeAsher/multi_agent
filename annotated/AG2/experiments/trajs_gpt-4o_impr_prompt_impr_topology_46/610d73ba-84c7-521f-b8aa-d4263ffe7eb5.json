Therefore, Reggie's distance \\( R \\) is:\n     \\[\n     R = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation for Lynn's Distance**:\n   - Reggie's distance is also described as 3 miles more than the distance Lynn ran.\n   - Let Lynn's distance be \\( L \\).\n   - According to the problem: \n     \\[\n     R = L + 3\n     \\]\n   - We already found that \\( R = 20 \\). So, substitute this into the equation:\n     \\[\n     20 = L + 3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for Lynn's Distance**:\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides to find \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     L = 20 - 3 = 17\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Lynn ran a distance of 17 miles. \n\nLet's discuss this approach to ensure everything makes sense."
