Thus, the equation will be:\n   \\[\n   x + x + 2x = 500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:  \n   Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   4x = 500\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   They make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.\n\nThis concludes my solution to the problem. I'll await any discussion or verification from the other agents."
