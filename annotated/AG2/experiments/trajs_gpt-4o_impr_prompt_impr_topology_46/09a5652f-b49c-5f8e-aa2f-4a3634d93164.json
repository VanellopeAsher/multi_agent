      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine John's running speed, which is calculated by dividing the total distance he runs by the total time spent running.\n\nHere’s how we can calculate it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine the Distance Run Each Day:**\n    - John runs a total of 60 miles per week, spread across 3 days.\n    - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n    - On the other two days, he runs half as much time each day as on the first day. So, he runs for \\(1.5\\) hours each on the second and third days.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Time Spent Running:**\n    - Total time running for the first day: \\(3\\) hours.\n    - Total time running for each of the remaining two days: \\(1.5\\) hours.\n    - Therefore, the total time spent running each week is:\n      \\[\n      3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Calculate John's Running Speed:**\n    - Running speed can be calculated using the formula:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n      \\]\n    - The total distance John runs in a week is \\(60\\) miles, and the total time he spends running is \\(6\\) hours.\n    - Thus, John's running speed is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n      \\]\n\nJohn's running speed is 10 miles per hour."
