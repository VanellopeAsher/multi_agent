So, he runs for \\(1.5\\) hours each on the second and third days.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Time Spent Running:**\n    - Total time running for the first day: \\(3\\) hours.\n    - Total time running for each of the remaining two days: \\(1.5\\) hours.\n    - Therefore, the total time spent running each week is:\n      \\[\n      3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Calculate John's Running Speed:**\n    - Running speed can be calculated using the formula:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n      \\]\n    - The total distance John runs in a week is \\(60\\) miles, and the total time he spends running is \\(6\\) hours.\n    - Thus, John's running speed is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n      \\]\n\nJohn's running speed is 10 miles per hour."
