So, he runs for \\(1.5\\) hours each on the second and third days.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Time Spent Running:**\n    - Total time running for the first day: \\(3\\) hours.\n    - Total time running for each of the remaining two days: \\(1.5\\) hours.\n    - Therefore, the total time spent running each week is:\n      \\[\n      3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Calculate John's Running Speed:**\n    - Running speed can be calculated using the formula:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n      \\]\n    - The total distance John runs in a week is \\(60\\) miles, and the total time he spends running is \\(6\\) hours.\n    - Thus, John's running speed is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n      \\]\n\nJohn's running speed is 10 miles per hour."

Let's examine the calculation step by step.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Distance and Time:**\n   - John runs a total of 60 miles in a week over 3 days.\n   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n   - On the second and third days, he runs for 1.5 hours each (since it's half as much as on the first day).\n\n2. **Calculating the Total Running Time:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Running Time} = 3 \\text{ hours (Day 1)} + 1.5 \\text{ hours (Day 2)} + 1.5 \\text{ hours (Day 3)} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Average Speed:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\nAfter verifying the calculations step by step, I find that the running speed is calculated correctly.
