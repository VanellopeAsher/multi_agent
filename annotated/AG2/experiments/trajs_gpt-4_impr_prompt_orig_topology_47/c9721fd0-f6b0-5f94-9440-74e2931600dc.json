      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

      "content": "First, we can calculate the total labor cost by multiplying the hourly rate of $35 by the number of hours worked. \n\nAlso, note that the company bills the full $35 even for a fraction of an hour. This means, for 2.25 hours of work, Patty's Plumbing will charge for 3 hours ($35 x 3).\n\nThen, we add the service fee of $40 and the cost of parts which is $60.\n\nLet's proceed to compute it using Python.\n\n```python\n# Definitions\nservice_fee = 40\nhourly_rate = 35\nhours_worked = 2.25\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# Calculate labor cost (rounding up to the nearest whole number)\nlabor_cost = hourly_rate * round(hours_worked)\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nPlease run this piece of python code and provide the output."

Add the service fee: $105 + $40 = $145.\n3. Finally, add the cost of parts: $145 + $60 = $170.\n\n Thus, the final answer is $170. This matches with the result we derived. \n\nHence, the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing is \\boxed{170}."
