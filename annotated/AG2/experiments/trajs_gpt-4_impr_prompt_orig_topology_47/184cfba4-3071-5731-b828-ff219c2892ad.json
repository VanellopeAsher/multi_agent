Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

      "content": "Approach:\nThis problem can be solved by formulating and solving an equation using the given conditions. Let's denote the quantity of small and large stuffed animals as 's' and 'l' respectively. The key information provided in the problem is:\n1. Price of a small stuffed animal = $40.\n2. Price of a large stuffed animal = 3 * Price of a small stuffed animal = 3*40 = $120.\n3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.\n4. She earned a total of $1200.\n\nWe can use these to write the following equations:\n1. s = 2*l (Quantity relationship between small and large stuffed animals she sold)\n2. 40s + 120l = 1200 (Total income she earned from the sales)\n\nNow, we substitute s = 2*l into the second equation and solve it for 'l'. The number of small stuffed animals 's' can be found by multiplying 'l' by 2. Let's do this using Python."

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: If she sold 12 small stuffed animals, this means she sold 12/2 = 6 large stuffed animals.\n2. Total income: The total income from the small stuffed animals is 12 * $40 = $480. The total income from large stuffed animals is 6 * $120 = $720. The total income, therefore, is $480 + $720 = $1200 which matches the given total income in the problem.\n3. As the calculated result checks out in the context of the problem, we can be confident that the calculated result is correct.\nFinal result:\nThe number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is \\boxed{12}."
