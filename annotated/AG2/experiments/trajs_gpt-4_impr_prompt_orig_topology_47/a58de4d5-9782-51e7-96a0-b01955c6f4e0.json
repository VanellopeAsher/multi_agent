  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend.

From there we can compute the profit.\n\nHere's how we can solve this:\n\n1. Compute the cost per jar by multiplying each ingredient weight by its price per pound and then summing them up.\n\nPython calculation 1: `cost_per_jar = 2 * 6 + 1.5 * 8 + 2 * 10`  \n\n2. Compute the total cost by multiplying the cost per jar by the number of jars.\n\nPython calculation 2: `total_cost= cost_per_jar * 10`  \n\n3. Compute the total income by multiplying the selling price per jar by the number of jars.\n\nPython calculation 3: `total_income = 50 * 10`  \n\n4. Compute the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total income.\n\nPython calculation 4: `profit = total_income - total_cost`\n\nThe final answer will be the value of `profit` calculated in step 4.\n\nLet's perform the computations."

Our costs per jar were calculated with formula `2*6 + 1.5*8 + 2*10`, which corresponds to 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound, and 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound. This should give us the total cost per jar.\n\n2. We then calculated the total cost for 10 jars by multiplying the cost per jar with 10.\n\n3. Total income was calculated by multiplying the 10 jars sold by $50 each.\n\n4. Finally we calculated the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total income.\n\nEverything seems correct, therefore he manages to make a profit of $60 by selling 10 jars. \n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{60}."
