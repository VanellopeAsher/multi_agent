Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPaisley, Reggie, and Lynn went for a run. Paisley covered a distance of 4 miles. Reggie ran a distance that was five times the distance that Paisley ran and also 3 miles more than what Lynn ran. Can you determine the distance that Lynn ran?"

      "content": "Approach: Direct Python Solution\n\nKey Concept:\nThe problem can be solved by setting up simple algebraic equations according to the given conditions and then solving those equations.\n\nLet's denote:\nP = distance run by Paisley\nR = distance run by Reggie\nL =  distance run by Lynn\n\nFrom the problem, we know\n1. P = 4 (Paisley ran 4 miles)\n2. R = 5P (Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran)\n3. R = L + 3 (Reggie ran 3 more miles than Lynn)\n\nWe can substitute the value of P in equation 2 and 3 and solve the simultaneous equations to find out the values of R and L. Let's implement this in Python. \n\n```python\n# define distances run by each person\nP = 4 \n\n# using the equations\nR = 5 * P # equation 2\nL = R - 3 # equation 3\n\nprint(L)\n```\nThis Python code will print out the distance that Lynn ran. \n\nVerification:\nWe can verify the solution by substituting the derived values of L and R into the given equations.\n1. R should equal 5P.\n2. R should be L + 3.\nThese checks will ensure the correctness of our solution."

Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran. (R = 5*P)\n3. Reggie ran 3 more miles than Lynn. (R = L + 3)\n\nSubstitute:\n\nFrom the Python code:\n1. Reggie's distance (R) = 5 * 4 = 20 miles \n2. Lynn's distance (L) = R - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 miles\n\nVerification:\n1. Reggie's distance is 5 times Paisley's distance: 20 = 5 * 4 (TRUE)\n2. Reggie's distance is 3 miles more than Lynn's distance: 20 = 17 + 3 (TRUE)\n\nAs we can see, the calculated values verify with the conditions given in the problem. \n\nHence, the final solution to the problem is: Lynn ran a total distance of 17 miles. \n\nAnswer: \\boxed{17}."
