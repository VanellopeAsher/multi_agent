Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDave purchased a big packet of french fries and consumed fourteen before a ravenous seagull snatched the packet from his grasp. Upon landing, the seagull devoured half the quantity of french fries that Dave had consumed. Subsequently, three pigeons chased him away from the meal, and each pigeon consumed three fries. Later, a raccoon pilfered two thirds of the remaining fries. A single french fry was then carried away by ants, leaving only five behind.

      "content": "To find the original number of french fries, we need to reverse all the actions starting from the end. \n\nHere are the steps to reverse:\n\n1. Add the single french fry taken by the ants to the final count of fries.\n2. To counteract the effect of the raccoon eating two thirds of the fries, we need to triple the result from step 1. \n3. Next, add the number of fries eaten by the three pigeons.\n4. Double the number from step 3 to account for the seagull eating half of what Dave ate.\n5. Finally, add the number of fries that Dave ate. \n\nBy adding all the fries consumed and left over, we should get the total number of fries originally in the packet. \n\nNow, let's implement these steps in Python and get that original quantity.\n\n```python\n# Final quantity left after the ants took one fry\nfinal_quantity = 5\n\n# Adding the single fry taken by the ants\nstep1 = final_quantity + 1\n\n# Countering the raccoon effect\nstep2 = step1 * 3\n\n# Adding fries taken by pigeons\nstep3 = step2 + (3 * 3)\n\n# Countering the seagull effect\nstep4 = step3 * 2\n\n# Adding fries eaten by Dave\noriginal_quantity = step4 + 14\n\nprint(original_quantity)\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, we will get the original quantity of french fries that Dave had."
