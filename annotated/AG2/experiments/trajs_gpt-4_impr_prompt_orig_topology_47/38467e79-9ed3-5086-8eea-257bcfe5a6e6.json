Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home. If 30 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?"

Two-thirds of students have desktop computers.\n2. 30 students don't have desktop computers.\n\nFrom this, it can be deduced that 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the students do not have desktop computers. This group, according to the problem, comprises 30 students. \n\nHence, we can calculate the total number of students by using the proportion:\n1/3 is to 30 as 1 is to X. \n\nLet's translate this into Python code and solve it."

If we calculate 2/3 of 90 (which should give us the number of students who have computers), we'll have:\n2/3 * 90 = 60\n\nThis means, at that grade level:\n- 30 students don't have desktop computers (which we knew from the problem)\n- 60 students have desktop computers\n- The total number of students is 90 (which is the sum of the above two groups)\n\nThis aligns with our initial understanding and verifies that our calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the total number of students at that grade level is \\boxed{90}. \n(Note that although the calculated value was 90.0, since number of students must be an integer, we take it as 90.)"
