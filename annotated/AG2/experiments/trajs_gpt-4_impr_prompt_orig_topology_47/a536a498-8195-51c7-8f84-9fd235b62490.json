      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%.

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: Reasoning-Based Solution.\n\nThe question involves a simple calculation. According to Courtney, the audience size was 48. But Kelly claimed that Courtney had overstated this number by 20%. \n\nTo find out how many people Kelly thought were there, we need to reduce Courtney's count by 20%. This can be done using the formula:\n\nOriginal_count = Courtney_count - (Courtney_count * (Overstated_percentage / 100)) \n\nThe solution can therefore be obtained by substituting the given values into this formula."

Hence, rounding off to the nearest whole number, the number of attendees according to Kelly was 38. \n\nHowever, the problem statement text says 40 people really attended the concert. This seems to be a discrepancy in the problem itself. The expected calculations lead to Kelly's count as 38 but the problem states Kelly believed the count to be 40. This seems inconsistent.\n\nThe audience size reported by Courtney was 48 as given in the question. Given this context, there's no new calculation needed for Courtney's count - so the answer to \"What was the audience size according to Courtney?\" is \\boxed{48}."
