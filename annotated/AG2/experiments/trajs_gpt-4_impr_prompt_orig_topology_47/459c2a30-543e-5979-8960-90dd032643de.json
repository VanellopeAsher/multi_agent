Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and much fewer white squares than green squares.  Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet. How much fewer are white squares  than green squares?"

Thanks for confirming the result. \n\nAfter following through the process, we find that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares on Brittany's comforter.\n\nVerification:\nThe total number of red squares is 14. Given that there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, this makes 18 blue squares. Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, there are a total of 24 green squares. Summing red, blue, and green squares, we have 14 + 18 + 24 = 56 squares. Having a total of 68 squares, this leaves 68 - 56 = 12 squares as white squares. We can also see that there are indeed 12 fewer white squares than the 24 green squares. \n\nHence, the final answer, in accordance with the Verification Steps is: \\boxed{12}."
