Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows. She has 6 presents for her family members, 4 presents for her buddies, and 2 presents for her educators. She possesses 144 inches of ribbon for this task. What is the length in inches of ribbon that she can allocate for each present's bow?"

      "content": "Key Idea: \nThe key idea of this problem lies in equal distribution of a total amount. To find the length of ribbon Monica can allocate for each present's bow, we need to divide the total length of ribbon she has (144 inches) by the total number of presents she has.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nThis problem can be solved directly by using Python to perform the computation.\n\nPython Solution:\n```python\ntotal_presents = 6 + 4 + 2  # Total number of presents\ntotal_ribbon = 144  # Total length of ribbon in inches\n\nribbon_per_present = total_ribbon / total_presents  # The length of ribbon Monica can allocate for each present's bow\n\nprint(ribbon_per_present)\n```\n\nNext, we can consider the verification steps needed and then offer a conclusion with the final result."

Check the mathematical operation of division: \n    - The total length of ribbon (144 inches) is divided by the total number of presents (12). The division is correctly executed in the above computation. \n\n2. Check the logic behind the operation: \n    - The question asks for the length of ribbon that can be allocated for each of the presents' bows. This necessitates dividing the total length of the ribbon available by the total number of gifts, which is precisely what the calculation accomplished.\n\nGiven that we have conducted an accurate mathematical operation within the correct logical structure of the problem, we can accurately conclude that \n\nThe length in inches of ribbon that Monica can allocate for each present's bow is \\boxed{12}."
