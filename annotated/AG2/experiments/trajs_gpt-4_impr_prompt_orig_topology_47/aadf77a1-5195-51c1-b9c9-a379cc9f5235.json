Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

      "content": "Nice work! The Python script correctly calculated that Octavia used 11 small shirts to make the quilt. Let's document this verification.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. The problem involved finding the total area covered by medium and large shirts, which is (4 sq. ft. * 8 shirts) + (6 sq. ft. * 6 shirts) = 32 sq. ft. + 36 sq. ft. = 68 sq. ft.\n2. The total area of the quilt is 101 sq. ft., so subtracting the area covered by the medium and large shirts leaves 101 sq. ft. - 68 sq. ft. = 33 sq. ft. still needing to be covered.\n3. Since each small shirt can cover an area of 3 sq. ft., the number of small shirts needed is 33 sq. ft. / 3 sq. ft. = 11 shirts.\n4. Our Python script correctly arrived at the answer of 11, meaning that it functions as expected.\n\nThe number of small shirts used to make the quilt is 11. Hence, the final answer is in the format ∎(boxed){_your_answer_}:\n\n∎(boxed){11}."
