      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

      "content": "Here is how we can approach this problem:\n\n1. Emil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad. Meaning, his dad will be 26 * 2 = 52 years old.\n\n2. At the same time, he will be twice as old as his brother. Meaning, his brother will be 26 / 2 = 13 years old.\n\n3. Therefore, the difference in age between Emil and his dad is 52 - 21 = 31 years. Similarly, the difference in age between Emil and his brother is 21 - 13 = 8 years.\n\n4. Hence, the current age of Emil's dad would be 31 + 21 = 52 years and the current age of Emil's brother would be 21 - 8 = 13 years. \n\n5. Finally, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now would be 52 + 13 = 65 years\n\nLet's verify this using python to prove our calculations."
