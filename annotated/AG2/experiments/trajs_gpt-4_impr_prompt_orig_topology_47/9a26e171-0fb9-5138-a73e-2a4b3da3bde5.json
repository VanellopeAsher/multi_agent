Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this number represents one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer at home, how many students are there at that grade level?"

Since all students have either a desktop or a laptop, the total number of students is equal to the number of students with a desktop plus the number of students without either a desktop or a laptop, so we have:\n\n3. `T = D + 60`\n\nWe now have a system of three equations with two variables, `D` and `T`. From equations 1 and 2 we can express `D` in terms of `T` and substitute it into equation 3. Let's do that using Python's sympy library."

Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. So `D = 3/4*T`.\n2. Twenty students do not have a desktop computer, so `N = T - D = T - 3/4*T = 1/4*T`.\n3. This 20 also represents one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop.

Thus, there are `3 * 20 = 60` students who do not have a computer. If we add the students with a desktop and who don't, we should obtain the total number of students: `D + 60 = 180 + 60 = 240`.\n\nSince the numbers match, we've narrowed down that the number of students in that grade level is 240.\n\nSo our final answer is $\\boxed{240}$."
