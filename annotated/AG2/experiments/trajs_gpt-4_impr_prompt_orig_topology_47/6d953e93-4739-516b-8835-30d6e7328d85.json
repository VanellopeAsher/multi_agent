For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.

      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "This is a word problem that can be resolved using algebra. We are given:\n\n1. The cost of repairing each truck tire ($60) and car tire ($40).\n2. The number of truck and car tires repaired on Thursday (6 and 4, respectively).\n3. The mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires on Friday.\n4. The mechanic makes $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n\nWe need to find out how many car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday.\n\nApproach:\n\nLet the number of car tires that the mechanic repairs on Friday be 'x'.\n\nAccording to the available information and fee charges provided:\n\n- On Thursday, the mechanic earns (6 * $60 for truck tires) + (4 * $40 for car tires).\n- As per the prompt, on Friday, the mechanic makes $40 less than on Thursday. \n\nSo, we can construct an algebraic equation from this information as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# equation based on the problem\nequation = Eq((60 * 6) + (40 * 4) - 40, 40 * x)\n\n# solve the equation\nnum_tires = solve(equation, x)\n\nprint(num_tires)\n```"

This process helps confirm the validity of our computed results.\n\nHere's how to verify it:\n - By substituting 'x' with 12 into the problem's equation, both sides of the equation will be equal.\n - The mechanic earns $400 on Thursday after repairing 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.\n - On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and earns $360.\n - The income on Thursday is indeed $40 more than the income on Friday.\n \nOur final answer is \\boxed{12}."
