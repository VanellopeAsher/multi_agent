Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGeorge needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000.5. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?"

Calculate the base cost for two tooth implants.\n2. Add the porcelain crown's cost to one of the implants.\n3. Deduct the deposit amount from the total cost to get the remaining amount.\n4. Divide the remaining amount by George's hourly wage to get the total hours he needs to work.\n\n# Python Solutions\n\n```python\n# The fee for each implant\nimplant_cost = 2000.5\n# The cost of the porcelain crown\nporcelain_crown_cost = 500.5\n# The amount of the deposit\ndeposit = 600\n# George's hourly wage\nhourly_wage = 15.3\n\n# The total price for two implants\ntotal_implant_cost = 2 * implant_cost \n\n# The overall cost including the porcelain crown for one implant\noverall_cost = total_implant_cost + porcelain_crown_cost\n\n# The remaining amount after deposit\nremaining_amount = overall_cost - deposit\n\n# The total hours George needs to work\ntotal_hours = remaining_amount / hourly_wage\n\ntotal_hours\n```\n\nPlease compute the result with the given code and provide the result."

An additional amount of $500.5 is added for the porcelain crown, bringing the total cost to $4501.\n3. A deposit of $600 is subtracted from this sum, resulting in a remaining balance of $3901.\n4. Given that George earns $15.3 per hour, we divide the remaining amount of $3901 by his hourly wage to calculate the number of hours he must work.\n5. The result, 255 hours, checks out with the given information and computation.\n\nTherefore the final result is $\\boxed{255}$ hours."
