Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "We can use Python to solve this problem directly.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of rows of each color of tulips Jackson will create based on how many tulips he has of each color and how many fit within a row. \n\nTo do this, we divide the number of tulips of each color by the number of tulips that fit in a row and round up to the nearest whole number, because even if there is a row that is not completely filled, it still counts as a row. The formula to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips is:\n\n```number_of_rows = ceil(number_of_tulips / tulips_per_row)```\n\nWhere:\n- number_of_tulips: The total number of tulips of a particular color that Jackson has.\n- tulips_per_row: The number of tulips of that color that can fit in a row.\n\nWe will use these calculated values to answer the final question: how many total rows of flowers will he plant.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\n\n```python\nfrom math import ceil\n\ndef calculate_rows(red_tulips, blue_tulips, yellow_tulips, red_per_row, blue_per_row, yellow_per_row):\n    # Calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips\n    red_rows = ceil(red_tulips / red_per_row)\n    blue_rows = ceil(blue_tulips / blue_per_row)\n    yellow_rows = ceil(yellow_tulips / yellow_per_row)\n\n    # Multiply the yellow rows by 2 since there is a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips\n    yellow_rows *= 2\n\n    # Calculate the total number of rows of flowers\n    total_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\n    print(total_rows)\n\ncalculate_rows(red_tulips=36, blue_tulips=24, \n               yellow_tulips=30, red_per_row=6, \n               blue_per_row=8, yellow_per_row=5)\n```\n\nThe output will be the total number of rows Jackson will plant in his garden."
