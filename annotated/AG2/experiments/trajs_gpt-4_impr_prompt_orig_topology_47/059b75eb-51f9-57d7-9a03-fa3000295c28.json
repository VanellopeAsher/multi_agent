Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain moment, a river is flowing with a volume of 4000 gallons of water. Following a day of intense rainfall, the water volume at the same location in the river becomes twice as much. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow at that point. What is the total volume of water flowing through that point of the river on the third day?"

You've run the code and returned the correct third day's total water volume.\n\nNow for verification:\n\nOn the first day, the volume of the water is given as 4000 gallons. \nOn the second day, the volume doubles, resulting in 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.\nOn the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the river's flow. So, the total volume on the third day becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.\n\nThe code's result matches our verification, so the total volume of water flowing through the river at that point on the third day is \\boxed{14000} gallons."
