Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSeth is twice as old as Brooke. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36. How old is Seth?"

      "content": "This problem involves crafting and solving a system of two linear equations. Let's denote Brooke's age as \"b\" and Seth's age as \"s\". We can form two equations based on the given information:\n\nEquation 1: Seth is twice as old as Brooke. This can be written as s = 2b.\nEquation 2: In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36, which translates to (s + 3) + (b + 3) = 36.\n\nOur goal is to find the value of \"s\", which indicates Seth's age. We can do so by solving these two equations. Let's proceed with Python and sympy to achieve our goal. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nb, s = symbols('b s')  # declare the symbols\neq1 = Eq(s, 2*b) \neq2 = Eq(s + 3 + b + 3, 36)\n\n# solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1,eq2), (s, b))\n\nprint(solution[s])\n```"

Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If Seth is 20, then Brooke is 10, which means condition 1 is satisfied.\n2. In 3 years, the sum of their ages is 36. This means that Seth will be 23 and Brooke will be 13, which gives us a total of 36. This confirms that condition 2 is also satisfied. \n\nThus, based on our evaluation, the solution seems to be valid."
