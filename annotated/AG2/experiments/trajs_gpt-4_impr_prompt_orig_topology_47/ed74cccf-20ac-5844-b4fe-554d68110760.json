Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?"

Understand that there are three different types of games played by the students which are tennis, volleyball, and soccer.\n2. Count the total number of students playing each game.\n3. Sum all the students to find the total number of students.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n1. There are 6 students playing tennis.\n2. There are twice the number of students who play tennis playing volleyball.\n3. There are an unknown number of boys (let's denote with variable 'b') and 22 girls playing soccer.\n\nLet's translate this information into a Python program:\n\n```python\n# Count of students who play tennis\ntennis = 6\n\n# The number of students who play volleyball is twice the number of students who play tennis\nvolleyball = 2 * tennis\n\n# Number of girls and boys who play soccer\ngirl_soccer = 22\nboy_soccer = 'b'  # 'b' represents some unknown ('undefined') quantity\n\n# Total count of students\ntotal_students = tennis + volleyball + girl_soccer + boy_soccer\n\nprint(total_students)\n```\nNote: The above program will not run successfully as it will encounter an error due to the undefined 'b'. It is necessary to know the number of boys who play soccer in order to calculate the total number of students. Thus, with the current information, the total number of students is indeterminable."

Verify by adding together all of the known quantities:\n  * 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 22 (soccer, girls only) = 40.\n3. Upon reviewing the problem, I can confirm that I have accounted for all given information - 6 tennis players, 12 volleyball players, and 22 girls who play soccer. However, the problem did not provide the number of boys playing soccer, which is a missing quantity.\n\nThe verification confirms that our calculation for the minimum known total of students, i.e. 40, is correct.
