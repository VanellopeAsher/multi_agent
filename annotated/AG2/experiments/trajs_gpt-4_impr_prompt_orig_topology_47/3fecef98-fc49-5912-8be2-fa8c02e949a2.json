Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. He also wants to make a duvet cover, 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.

      "content": "The question involves a simple calculation. Jim needs two pieces of fabric with sizes bigger than the size of the bed by 2 feet in each dimension. And he needs fabric for a duvet cover. We are asked to find the total area of fabric Jim needs to buy.\n\nHere's how we can calculate it:\n- The area of fabric he needs for a bed comforter is 2 times the area of a piece of fabric that is 2 feet larger in each dimension than the bed.\n- The area of fabric he needs for the duvet cover is simply its length times its width.\n\nThis problem can be solved directly using a Python code. Let's write a Python program to solve it.\n\n```python\n# The dimensions of the bed plus additional 2 feet in each dimension\ncomforter_length = 6 + 2\ncomforter_width = 8 + 2\n# The dimensions of the duvet cover\nduvet_length = 9\nduvet_width = 11\n\n# Area calculation for a both side comforter and a duvet cover\narea_comforter = 2 * comforter_length * comforter_width\narea_duvet = duvet_length * duvet_width\n\n# The total area of fabric Jim needs to buy\ntotal_area = area_comforter + area_duvet\n\nprint(total_area)\n```\n\nThe above code calculates the total area of fabric Jim needs to buy in square feet. If we need the result in approximate form, we can use the `round()` function. But in this case it is not necessary, because the result will be an integer."
