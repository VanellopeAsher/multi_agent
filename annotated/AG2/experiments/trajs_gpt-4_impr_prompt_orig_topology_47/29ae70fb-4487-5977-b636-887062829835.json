Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is that Manny's parents won't sign him up for karate classes again, if the cost per class exceeds $10. We are given that the total cost for all his karate classes is $60, but we don't know how many classes he can miss before the cost per class surpasses $10. Let's denote x as the number of classes Manny can miss, and then set up an equation we can solve using Python.\n\nHere's our reasoning:\n1. If Manny misses x classes out of the total 10, he'll actually attend 10 - x classes.\n2. The cost per class that Manny actually attends will then be $60 / (10 - x).\n3. We know this cost must remain at or below $10 per class for Manny's parents to sign him up again.\n\nBy putting it all together, we get the following inequality:\n\n$60 / (10 - x) <= $10\n\nLet's solve it as Python code. I'll use sympy to handle this. We will use the solve_univariate_inequality function from sympy to solve this inequality. It takes two arguments: the inequality and the variable to solve for. Finally, we will convert the solution to a set to extract the maximum number of classes Manny can miss. \n\nOur process is as follows:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules from sympy,\n2. Define the variable and the inequality,\n3. Solve the inequality,\n4. Extract the maximum number of classes that Manny can miss. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve_univariate_inequality\n\n# Define the variable and the inequality\nx = symbols('x')\ninequality = 60 / (10 - x) <= 10\n\n# Solve the inequality\nsolution = solve_univariate_inequality(inequality, x)\n\n# Extract the maximum number of classes Manny can miss\nmax_missed_classes = max(solution.as_relational(x).args) if solution.is_Relational else max(solution.args)\nprint(max_missed_classes)\n```"

The 'solve_univariate_inequality' function actually returns a Interval object which indicates a continuous range of real numbers for which the inequality holds true.

Hence, we should just solve this inequality within the range 0 to 10 (as you can't miss less than 0 or more than 10 classes). For each integer value, evaluate if the inequality $60 / (10 - x) <= 10 holds true.

The total cost for these 6 classes is $60, so the cost per class is $60 / 6 = $10.
