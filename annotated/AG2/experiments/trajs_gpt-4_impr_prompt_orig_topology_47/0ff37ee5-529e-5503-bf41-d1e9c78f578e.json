Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

After buying dinner, Ali had \\$32 left, which is 2/5 of the amount he had after giving half to his sister (because he used 3/5 of his money to buy dinner). \n\nHere are our steps:\n\n1. Ali's money after giving half to his sister = \\$32 / (2/5) = \\$80. \n2. Ali's original amount = \\$80 * 2 = \\$160.\n3. Subtract the amount of money from the $20 bills: \\$160 - \\$120 = \\$40.\n4. Divide this amount by $10 to find the number of $10 bills: \\$40 / \\$10 = 4. \n\nLet's do it in code. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner.\nafter_dinner = 32\n\n# Calculate how much money Ali had after giving half to his sister.\nafter_giving_sister = after_dinner / Rational(2, 5)\n\n# Ali's original amount\noriginal_amount = after_giving_sister * 2\n\n# The money from the $20 bills.\ntwenty_bills = 20 * 6\n\n# Subtract this amount from his original amount of money.\nremaining_money = original_amount - twenty_bills\n\n# The number of $10 bills.\nten_bills = remaining_money / 10\n\n# Print the results.\nprint(\"The number of $10 bills Ali had originally is\", ten_bills)\n```\n\nBy running the above python code, we can get the number of $10 bills Ali had originally."
