Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

This is given by multiplying her normal throwing distance by 3 (as she can throw three times farther).\n\nNext, to determine how far outside the dragon's flame range Polly can stand, we need to subtract the dragon's flame range from Polly's enhanced throwing distance.\n\nLet's write this calculation in Python:\n\n```python\n# regular javelin throw distance by Polly\nregular_throw_distance = 4000 \n\n# enhanced throwing distance\ngemstone_bonus_factor = 3\nenhanced_throw_distance = regular_throw_distance * gemstone_bonus_factor\n\n# dragon's flame range\ndragons_reach = 10000\n\n# distance outside of dragon's reach where Polly can stand\ndistance_outside_dragons_reach = enhanced_throw_distance - dragons_reach\n\nprint(distance_outside_dragons_reach)\n```"

With the sapphire gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin three times this distance (4000 feet * 3 = 12000 feet).\n3. The dragon's fire reached up to 10000 feet.\n4. Subtracting the dragon's fire range from Polly's enhanced throw distance (12000 feet - 10000 feet) results in the distance Polly could stand outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon.\n\nGiven these calculations, the results seem correct.\n\nSo, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly could stand \boxed{2000} feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
