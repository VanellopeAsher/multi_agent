Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16. What will be her age after 4 years?"

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach:\n\nThis problem can be solved using basic arithmetic operations. According to the problem statement, Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. This implies that Charmaine is currently 16 - 12 = 4 years old. After 4 years, her age will be 4 + 4 = 8 years old.\n\nWe can use Python to perform the above operations and calculate Charmaine's age after 4 years. \n\n```python\n# current age of Charmaine\ncurrent_age = 16 - 12\n\n# age of Charmaine after 4 years\nage_after_4_years = current_age + 4\n\nprint(age_after_4_years)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nStep 1: We computed Charmaine's current age by subtracting 12 from 16. The result was 4, which is the current age of Charmaine.\nStep 2: We then computed Charmaine's age after 4 years by adding 4 to her current age. The result was 8, which is Charmaine's age after 4 years.\n\nTherefore, Charmaine will be 420 years old after 4 years. The final answer is \boxed{8}."
