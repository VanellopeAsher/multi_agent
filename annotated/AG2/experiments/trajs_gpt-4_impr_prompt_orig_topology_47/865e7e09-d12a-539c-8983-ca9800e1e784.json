Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo girls each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water. Then a boy got 8 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?"

      "content": "Approach:\nThis problem can be tackled through a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Calculate the total volume of water received by the two girls. As each girl got 1/4 of 32 liters, we just multiply 1/4 by 32 liters for a single girl. To obtain the total volume for the two girls, we multiply the result by 2.\n2. Afterward, we subtract the volume received by the boy which is 8 liters.\n3. Finally, we subtract the total volume obtained by the girls and the boy from the original volume of 32 liters to find out the remaining volume.\n\nNow let's compute it using Python and sympy: \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the total volume of water\ntotal_volume = 32\n\n# calculate the total volume of water received by the two girls\ngirls_volume = 2 * Rational(1, 4) * total_volume\n\n# volume received by the boy\nboy_volume = 8\n\n# calculate the remaining volume of water\nremaining_volume = total_volume - girls_volume - boy_volume\n\nremaining_volume\n```"

So, both girls got 2*8 = 16 liters in total.\n3. The boy got 8 liters of water.\n4. After subtracting the total volume received by the girls and the boy from the total volume, we get: 32 (total) - 16 (girls) - 8 (boy) = 8 liters.\n\nTherefore, the remaining volume of water is 8 liters, which matches the computed solution.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{8}."
