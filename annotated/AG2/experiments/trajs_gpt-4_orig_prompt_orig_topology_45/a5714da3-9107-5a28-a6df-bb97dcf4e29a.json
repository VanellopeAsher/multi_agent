You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.

We can do this directly with Python:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the corals and the fish food. After that, we add these to the cost of the aquarium Scarlett bought at the yard sale.\n\nWhen calculating costs, we have to take into account the number of items bought. Scarlett bought 2 bags of rocks and 3 pieces of coral, and the prices given are for one piece. The fish food cost will be added as is, since no quantity is specified.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to solve this problem.\n\n```python\naquarium_cost = 10.00\nrocks_cost = 2.50 * 2\ncoral_cost = 2.00 * 3\nfood_cost = 2.00\n\ntotal_cost = aquarium_cost + rocks_cost + coral_cost + food_cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```"
