We know the total size of the comforter and the quantities of each colored square (in terms of red squares). We can use this information to find out how much fewer white squares there are than green squares.\n\nWe can start by calculating how many squares there are for each color, and then subtracting this from the total size of the comforter to get the number of white squares.\n\nAfter we obtained the quantity of the white squares, we subtract it from the quantity of the green squares to get the difference.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# first we define the symbols we're going to use\nred_squares, blue_squares, green_squares, white_squares, total_size = symbols('red_squares blue_squares green_squares white_squares total_size')\n\n# we state what we know\ntotal_size = 68\nred_squares = 14\nblue_squares = red_squares + 4\ngreen_squares = blue_squares + 6\n\n# we calculate the number of white squares\nwhite_squares_expr = total_size - red_squares - blue_squares - green_squares\nwhite_squares = solve(white_squares_expr)[0]\n\n# we calculate the difference between green and white squares\ngreen_white_diff = green_squares - white_squares\n\nprint(green_white_diff)\n```\nThe result is the difference between the green squares and the white squares."

We don't need to use the solve function here. Let me correct this.\n\nCorrected code:\n```python\n# first we define the symbols we're going to use\nred_squares, blue_squares, green_squares, white_squares, total_size = symbols('red_squares blue_squares green_squares white_squares total_size')\n\n# we state what we know\ntotal_size = 68\nred_squares = 14\nblue_squares = red_squares + 4\ngreen_squares = blue_squares + 6\n\n# we calculate the number of white squares\nwhite_squares = total_size - red_squares - blue_squares - green_squares\n\n# we calculate the difference between green and white squares\ngreen_white_diff = green_squares - white_squares\n\nprint(green_white_diff)\n```\nThis corrected code directly subtracts the total quantity of red, blue, and green squares from the total size - which is the correct way to calculate the number of white squares.
