You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

      "content": "From the problem statement, we can interpret that the ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts, then into 5 equal parts per each of the 4 parts, resulting in 5 x 4 = 20 equal parts in total. Each of those 20 equal parts is 5 cm long.\n\nSo the length of the ribbon can be calculated by multiplying the length of one part by the total number of parts, i.e., 5 cm/part * 20 parts = 100 cm.\n\nThus, we can solve this problem with Python code directly.\n\nLet's write a program to calculate the length of the ribbon."
