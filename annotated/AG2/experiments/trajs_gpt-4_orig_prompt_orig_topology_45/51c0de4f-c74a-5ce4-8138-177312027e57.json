So, we need to find out how much came from sources other than the friend in order for the lawyer to triple that. \n\nTo find the friend's contribution, we need to deduct the lawyer's contribution and the contributions before the friend's donation from the total amount. \n\nWe are given:\n- the lawyer's contribution = $6600\n- contribution from neighbors = $500\n- contribution from the online fund = $1500\n\nTo calculate the friend's contribution, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. The lawyer triples the total donation before the friend's contribution.\n   We will calculate this by dividing the lawyer's contribution by 3.\n\n2. To find out the friend's contribution, we will subtract the donation from neighbors and the online fund from the amount gotten from step 1.\n\nLet's complete these calculations using Python."
