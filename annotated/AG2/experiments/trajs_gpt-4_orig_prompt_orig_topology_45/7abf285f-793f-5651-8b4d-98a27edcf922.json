Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total minimum payment Jessica makes each month and then figure out how much is 50% more than this total minimum. This will give us her monthly debt payment. We then need to consider that this payment needs to be made over a year, so we multiply the monthly debt payment by 12 to get the payment for a full year.\n\nLet's start coding the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# setting the minimum payments\nstudent_loan_min_payment = 300\ncredit_card_min_payment = 200\nmortgage_min_payment = 500\n\n# setting the cost for Netflix and gym\nnetflix_cost = 15\ngym_cost = 0\n\n# calculating the total minimum payment\ntotal_min_payment = student_loan_min_payment + credit_card_min_payment + mortgage_min_payment\n\n# calculating how much is Jessica paying on top of the minimum\nadditional_payment = total_min_payment * 0.5\n\n# calculating Jessica's total monthly payment (including the additional 50%)\ntotal_monthly_payment = total_min_payment + additional_payment + netflix_cost + gym_cost\n\n# calculating the total yearly payment\ntotal_yearly_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\nprint(total_yearly_payment)\n```\n\nThe output from this code will give us the amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year.\nWe put the result in \\boxed{}."
