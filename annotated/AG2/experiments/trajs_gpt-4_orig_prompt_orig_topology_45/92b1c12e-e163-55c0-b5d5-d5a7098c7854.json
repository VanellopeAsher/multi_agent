You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.

Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his daughter's age. This translates to the equation 2 * y - 5 = 45.\n2. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of her brother. This translates to the equation y = 3 * x + 4.\n\nThese two equations form a linear system, which we can solve to find the values of x and y.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# declare the equations\neq1 = Eq(2*y - 5, 45)\neq2 = Eq(y, 3*x + 4)\n\n# solve the equations\nsolutions = solve((eq1,eq2), (x, y))\n\nprint(solutions)\n```\nThe result from this code will give us the ages of Carver's son (x) and daughter (y)."
