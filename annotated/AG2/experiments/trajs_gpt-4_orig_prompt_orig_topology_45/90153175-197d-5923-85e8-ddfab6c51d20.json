You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.

Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, so she consumes 3 eggs per day. \nOne week consists of 7 days and 12 weeks would consist of 7*12 days.\nEach dozen consists of 12 eggs.\n\nIt's a simple arithmetic problem that can be solved directly using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variables\neggs_per_omelette = 3\ndays_per_week = 7\nweeks = 12\neggs_per_dozen = 12\n\n# calculate total eggs consumed in 12 weeks\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_omelette * days_per_week * weeks\n\n# convert total eggs to dozens\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / eggs_per_dozen\n\nprint(dozens_of_eggs)\n```\nThe answer is the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks. The result should be represented as a simplified fraction if it's not an integer."
