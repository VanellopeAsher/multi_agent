It also says that he killed \"three fewer cougars than the previous night\", meaning he killed `x - 3` cougars today. \n\nAs a result, the total number of animals killed by Rick over the two days would be `10 + x (first night) + 3x + x - 3 (second night)`. \n\nLet's update our equation to reflect this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# total animals killed over the two days\ntotal_animals = Eq(10 + x + 3*x + x - 3)\n\n# solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(total_animals, x)\n\n# output the solution\nprint(sum(solution))\n```\n\nThis should give us the correct number of animals Rick killed over the two nights."

We should calculate the total number of animals directly, not solve an equation.\n\nThere's enough information to calculate the total number of animals. Let's denote the number of cougars Rick killed on the first day as `x`. Then, on the second day, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars he hunted on the first day, and three fewer cougars than the first day. So the total number of animals Rick hunted is `10 (wolves first day) + x (cougars first day) + 3x (wolves second day) + (x - 3) (cougars second day)`.\n\nTherefore, the task now is not to find `x` but to figure out a reasonable value for `x` which makes the total number of animals an integer.\n\nGiven that `x - 3` must be non-negative (since Rick can't kill negative numbers of cougars), the minimum value for `x` is 3. We can try this value and see if the total number of animals is an integer. If not, we can increase `x` by 1 and try again, and repeat this process until we find an integer total. We can use a while loop for this.\n\n```python\nx = 3\ntotal_animals = 10 + x + 3*x + x - 3\n\nwhile total_animals % 1 != 0:\n    x += 1\n    total_animals = 10 + x + 3*x + x - 3\n\nprint(total_animals)\n```"
