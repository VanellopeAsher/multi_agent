You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJake is shopping at a clothing store.

So out of every two shirts, one will be 80 dollars and the other will be 50% off, which is 40 dollars. Hence, for 20 shirts, the price would be 10 times the price of these two shirts. For the shoes, we calculate 40% off of the original price.\n\nLet's calculate these in Python directly:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# unit price of T-shirts\nshirt_price = 80\n# number of T-shirts\nshirt_number = 20\n# original price of shoes\noriginal_shoe_price = 400\n# discount rate of shoes\nshoe_discount_rate = 0.4\n\n# calculate the total price for T-shirts under the 'buy one get one 50% off' deal\nshirt_total_price = shirt_number/2 * (shirt_price + shirt_price/2)\n# calculate the discounted price for the shoes\ndiscounted_shoe_price = original_shoe_price * (1 - shoe_discount_rate)\n\n# calculate the total amount of money Jake spends\ntotal_amount = shirt_total_price + discounted_shoe_price\n\nprint(total_amount)\n```"
