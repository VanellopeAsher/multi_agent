You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

      "content": "From the problem statement, we can interpret three equations:\n1. When Emil turns 26, his dad's age will be double his own age, so dad's age will be 2 * 26 = 52.\n2. Also, Emil will be twice as old as his brother when Emil is 26. So, his brother's age will be 26/2 = 13.\n3. With the rates at which Emil, his dad, and his brother age, 5 years from now, Emil's age (26) is half his dad's age (52) and double his brother's age (13). Thus, we can find their current age by subtracting the 5 years.\n\nNow, let's set up the equations and solve for each person's current age. Then, we will find the sum of the age of Emil's dad and brother.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# set up symbols\ndad_age_future, bro_age_future = symbols('dad_age_future bro_age_future')\n\n# equations\neq1 = Eq(dad_age_future, 2*26)  # dad's future age\neq2 = Eq(bro_age_future, 26/2)  # brother's future age\n\n# solve the equations\ndad_age_future = solve(eq1)[0]\nbro_age_future = solve(eq2)[0]\n\n# find current age\ndad_age_now = dad_age_future - 5\nbro_age_now = bro_age_future - 5\n\n# print the sum of their ages\nprint(dad_age_now + bro_age_now)\n```\n\nThe output will be the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother."
