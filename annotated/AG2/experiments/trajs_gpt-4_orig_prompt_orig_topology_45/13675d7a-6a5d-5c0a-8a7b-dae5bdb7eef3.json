You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

The total number of wheels used is equal to the sum of the wheels used for each type of toy: 4 wheels for each car and 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Then, we add this number to the 276 wheels left in the box to get the total number of wheels that were in the box originally.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# the number of cars Henry needs to assemble\nnum_cars = 57\n\n# the number of motorcycles Henry needs to assemble\nnum_motorcycles = 73\n\n# the number of wheels per car\nwheels_per_car = 4\n\n# the number of wheels per motorcycle\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\n\n# the number of wheels left in the box after assembly\nwheels_left = 276\n\n# calculate the total number of wheels used for assembly\ntotal_wheels_used = (num_cars * wheels_per_car) + (num_motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle)\n\n# calculate the original number of wheels in the box\ntotal_wheels = total_wheels_used + wheels_left\n\nprint(total_wheels)\n```"
