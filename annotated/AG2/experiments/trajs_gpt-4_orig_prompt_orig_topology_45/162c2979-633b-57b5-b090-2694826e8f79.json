She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.

      "content": "Key Idea:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of the strawberry gum. Then we will calculate the total cost of the grape gum. Since the green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum, we find its cost. Finally, add all the costs to get the total cost.\n\nLet's calculate it using Python:\n\n```python\n# cost of Strawberry gum\ncost_strawberry = 2 * 2  # There are two packs of strawberry gum\n\n# cost of Grape gum\ncost_grape = 2  # There is one pack of grape gum\n\n# cost of  Green apple gum\ncost_green_apple = 2 / 2  # Green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_strawberry + cost_grape + cost_green_apple\nprint(total_cost)\n```\nAfter running this program, we can get the total cost of gum that Suzie paid."
