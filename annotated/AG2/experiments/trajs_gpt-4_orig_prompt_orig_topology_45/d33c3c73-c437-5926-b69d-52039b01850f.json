Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Calculate the difference between Tuesday's and Wednesday's depths.\n5. Calculate the increase on Thursday (1/2 of the difference).\n6. Calculate Thursday's depth (Wednesday's depth + increase).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# Define the depth on Monday\ndepth_monday = 17\n\n# Tuesday: The tank had 7 feet more water than it had on Monday\ndepth_tuesday = depth_monday + 7\n\n# Wednesday: The depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday\ndepth_wednesday = (2/3) * depth_tuesday\n\n# Thursday: The tank's water depth increased by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday\ndifference = depth_tuesday - depth_wednesday\nincrease_thursday = (1/2) * difference\n\n# Calculate the tank’s water depth on Thursday\ndepth_thursday = depth_wednesday + increase_thursday\n\nprint(depth_thursday)\n```"
