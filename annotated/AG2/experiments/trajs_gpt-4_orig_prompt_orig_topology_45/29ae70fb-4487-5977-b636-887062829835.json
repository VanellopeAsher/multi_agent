  "problem": "Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. Manny also signed up for a painting class that costs $30, but his parents don't care about the cost of this class. If there are 10 total Karate classes, how many Karate classes can he miss before they don't sign him up again?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.
