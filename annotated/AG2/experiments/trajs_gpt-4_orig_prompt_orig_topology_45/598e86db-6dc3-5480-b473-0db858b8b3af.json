You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

During his working days, he volunteered for 3 hours a day and in total, he helped 240 people. We can start by calculating how many days Billy worked between those dates, then we can then determine how many hours Billy worked in total. Finally, we can calculate how many people he helps per hour by dividing the total number of people served by the total hours worked.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can start by counting the number of days from March 1st to April 19th, then calculate 80% of those days to find out how many days Billy actually worked. After that, we can find the total hours he worked by multiplying the days by 3. Finally, divide the total number of people Billy helped by the total hours he worked.\n\nSo, the problem can be divided into three steps. Each step generates a sub-problem which can be solved using Python directly. Let's solve these sub-problems step-by-step.\n\nLet's start with the first step which is calculating the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th."
