  "problem": "Tim concocts a unique blend of honey and jam. To prepare one jar of this blend, he requires 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the special honey is $10 per pound. Each jar of this unique blend is sold for $50. What is the profit that Tim earns from selling 10 jars of this blend?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.
