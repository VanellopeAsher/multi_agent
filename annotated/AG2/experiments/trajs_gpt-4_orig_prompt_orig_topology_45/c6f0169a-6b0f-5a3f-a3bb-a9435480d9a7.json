You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOf the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic.

Then, we subtract the number of cars that are currently rented out or under maintenance from the total number of cars to find out how many cars are currently available. Finally, we calculate what fraction of the remaining cars are semi-automatic and convert this fraction into a percentage to get our answer.\n\nHere is the Python code for this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total number of cars\ntotal_cars = 20 \n\n# number of automatic and manual cars\nautomatic_cars = 12\nmanual_cars = 4\n\n# number of automatic cars rented out and manual cars under maintenance\nautomatic_cars_rented = 3\nmanual_cars_maintenance = 2\n\n# number of semi-automatic cars\nsemi_automatic_cars = total_cars - automatic_cars - manual_cars\n\n# number of cars remaining after rental and maintenance\nremaining_cars = total_cars - automatic_cars_rented - manual_cars_maintenance\n\n# fraction of remaining cars that are semi-automatic\nsemi_automatic_fraction = Rational(semi_automatic_cars, remaining_cars)\n\n# convert fraction to percentage\nsemi_automatic_percentage = semi_automatic_fraction * 100\n\nprint(semi_automatic_percentage)\n```\n\nYou can run the above Python code and provide the output.
