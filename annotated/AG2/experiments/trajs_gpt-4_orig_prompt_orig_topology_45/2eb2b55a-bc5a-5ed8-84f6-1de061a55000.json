Since we know the number of bandages used each day and the number of bandages acquired, we can calculate the total number of bandages they had at the beginning.\n\nHere's how we can do that: \n\nDay 1: Purchased 1 pack(50 bandages) and used 38 bandages. So, they have 50-38 bandages left at the end of Day 1.\n\nDay 2: Used 10 bandages less than Day 1 which is 28 bandages. So, they have Day 1 remaining - Day 2 used bandages left at the end of Day 2.\n\nDay 3: Purchased 2 packs(100 bandages) and used half pack(25 bandages). So, they have Day 2 remaining + Day 3 purchased - Day 3 used = 78 bandages.\n\nFrom this, we can derive the equation to find the total number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day.\n\nLet's use Python to solve it."
