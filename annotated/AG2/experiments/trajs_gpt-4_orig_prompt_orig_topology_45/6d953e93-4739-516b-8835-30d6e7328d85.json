  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "Key idea: The problem can be solved by setting up a simple algebraic equation. Since the earnings from Thursday and Friday are connected, we can make them into one equation and solve for the variable.\n\nFirstly, let's calculate the earnings from Thursday:\nFor the truck tires, it is 6 * $60 = $360. \nFor the car tires, it is 4 * $40 = $160. \nSo, Thursday's earnings are $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nLet x be the number of car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday. \nSince the mechanic earns $40 for each car tire, his earning on Friday would be $40 * x.\nAccording to the problem, Thursday's earnings are $40 more than Friday's earnings, we can set up the following equation: $520 = $40 * x + $40.\n\nNow we just need to solve this equation using Python.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\nx = sp.Symbol('x')\nequation = sp.Eq(520, 40 * x + 40)\n\nnum_of_tires = sp.solve(equation, x)\nprint(num_of_tires[0])\n```"
