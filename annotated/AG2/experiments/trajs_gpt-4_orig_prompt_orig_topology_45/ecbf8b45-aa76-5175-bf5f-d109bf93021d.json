I will be asking you how many packs of balloons they filled up. After you tell me the number of packs, I can calculate the total number of balloons initially. Then I subtract from this the number of balloons that are left to find the answer. \n```python\n# Your code\nballoons_per_pack = 30\n# Ask for the number of packs.\nballoons_left = 12\n```"
