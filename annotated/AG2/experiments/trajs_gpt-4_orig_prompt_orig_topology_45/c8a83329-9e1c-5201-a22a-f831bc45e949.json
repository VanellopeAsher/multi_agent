Erica initially has 20 cards she made herself.\n2. We don't know the number of cards in each box her dad brought, so let's use a variable to represent that: `cards_in_a_box`. Her dad brought her 2 boxes. Therefore, the total number of cards Erica has after her dad brought the boxes is `20 + 2 * cards_in_a_box`.\n3. Erica then passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which means she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards. After giving out these cards, the total number she has is `20 + 2 * cards_in_a_box - 29`.\n4. Erica received 17 cards from family and friends, increasing the total number of cards she has to `20 + 2 * cards_in_a_box - 29 + 17`.\n5. Simplifying the previous expression gives us `2 * cards_in_a_box + 8`, which is the final number of cards Erica has.\n\nUnless we have the number of cards in each box (i.e. the value of `cards_in_a_box`), we can't calculate a numerical answer. This means the best answer we can give right now is in the form of an expression: \\boxed{2 * \\text{cards\\_in\\_a\\_box} + 8}. This expression means Erica has twice the number of cards in a box, plus 8 more. \n\nTo receive a definitive numerical answer, please provide the number of cards in each box."
