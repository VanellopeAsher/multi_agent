You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it.

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. \n\nHence, given that there are 2 remoras each of 6 inches long, the total length of remoras will be 2*6 = 12 inches. \n\nWe can set up the equation as follows: \n0.10 * Shark's body length = Remoras' length\n\nWhen the problem statement is converted into a mathematical equation, we can solve it directly by Python.\n\nLet's call the shark's length `x`.\nThen we have: 0.10 * x = 12 inches\n\nWe are trying to solve the above equation for `x`.\n\nLet's set it up in Python and solve for `x`."
