You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed.

However, he needs an additional 2 feet on each side, making the dimensions 8 feet long and 10 feet wide. For his duvet cover, it's 9 feet long and 11 feet wide. \n\nWe need to double the area calculated for the comforter since he needs two pieces.\n\nAfterwards, we add the area of the comforter and the duvet cover.\n\nTo summarize:\n* Calculate the area of fabric for the comforter by multiplying the length and the width.\n* Multiply the result by 2 since he needs two pieces of fabric for the comforter.\n* Calculate the area for the duvet cover by multiplying its length and width.\n* Add the area of both the comforter and the duvet cover for the total area.\n\nHere's how you can solve it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.abc import l, w, a\n\n# Calculate area of fabric required for the comforter\ncomforter_length = 6 + 2\ncomforter_width = 8 + 2\ncomforter_area = comforter_length * comforter_width * 2 # Factor of 2 since he needs two pieces\n\n# Calculate area of fabric required for the duvet cover\nduvet_length = 9\nduvet_width = 11\nduvet_area = duvet_length * duvet_width\n\n# Total area required\ntotal_area = comforter_area + duvet_area\nprint(total_area)\n```\n\nThe answer will be the total area of fabric that Jim needs to buy, in square feet."
