You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11.

The problem also mentions that their combined age is 162. For finding Allen's age 10 years from now, firstly, we will calculate the present ages by solving the equation 7x+11x=162, and then adding 10 years to Allen's age.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(7*x + 11*x, 162)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation)\n\nprint(solution)\n\n# Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now\nAllen_age_future = 11*solution[0] + 10\n\nprint(Allen_age_future)\n```"
