  "problem": "James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 30-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 3 miles per hour.  He swims 70% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 30-mile lake.

Find the distance to swim before and after rest (70% and 30% of 30 miles).\n2. Compute the time it takes to swim these distances at the given speeds \n3. Compute the resting time (half the swimming time before rest).\n4. Add up these times to find the total time.\n\nLet's write the Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the total distance, speed, and portion of the distance to swim before rest.\ntotal_distance = 30\ninitial_speed = 3\ninitial_portion = 0.7\n\n# compute the distance to swim before rest\ninitial_distance = total_distance * initial_portion\n\n# compute the time to swim this distance\ninitial_time = initial_distance / initial_speed\n\n# compute the resting time\nrest_time = initial_time / 2\n\n# compute the distance to swim after rest\nfinal_distance = total_distance - initial_distance\n\n# compute the time to swim this distance (at half the speed)\nfinal_speed = initial_speed / 2\nfinal_time = final_distance / final_speed\n\n# compute the total time\ntotal_time = initial_time + rest_time + final_time\ntotal_time\n```\n\nLet's get the output for the code above."
