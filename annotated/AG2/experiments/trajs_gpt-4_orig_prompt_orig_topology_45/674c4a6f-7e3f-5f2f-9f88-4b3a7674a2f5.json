Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

The average of a set of numbers is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by the count of the numbers.\n\nWe can directly solve this problem using Python code. Since there are only 5 numbers, Python can calculate the result easily.\n\nHere are the steps in Python code.\nFirstly, I will add up all the test scores using the built-in `sum()` function. Secondly, I will divide the sum by the count of the test scores, which are 5, to get the average.\n\n```python\n# list of Wilson's test scores\ntest_scores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# calculate the sum of the test scores\nsum_scores = sum(test_scores)\n\n# calculate the average of the test scores\naverage_score = sum_scores / len(test_scores)\nprint(average_score)\n```"
