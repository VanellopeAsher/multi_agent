You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

Here are the steps:\n\n- Let's denote the number of $10 bills Ali has as x.\n- The total amount of money Ali has is $10*x + $20*6\n- Ali gives half of total money to her sister, the remaining is ($10*x + $20*6) / 2\n- Then Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner, the remaining after dinner is ($10*x + $20*6) / 2 * (1 - 3/5) = $32\n\nSo, we can form the equation and solve it using sympy.\n\nThe Python code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# create and solve the equation\nequation = sp.Eq(((10*x + 20*6) / 2) * (1 - 3/5), 32)\nsolution = sp.solve(equation, x)\n\n# print the result\nprint(\"The number of $10 bills Ali has originally is: \", solution[0])\n\n# For reading purposes let's make it as an integer\nprint(\"The number of $10 bills Ali has originally is: \", int(solution[0]))\n```\n\nMake sure to run this code to get your answer."
