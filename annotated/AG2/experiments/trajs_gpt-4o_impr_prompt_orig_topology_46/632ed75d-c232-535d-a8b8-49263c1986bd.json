Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we must determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft in relation to its total number of flights and its distribution to different destinations.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Total Flights of the Second Aircraft**:\n   - The second aircraft flies to Poland exclusively.\n   - It completes 44 flights, which represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Flights of the First Aircraft**:\n   - If 44 flights are half the total flights made by the first aircraft, then the total number of flights for the first aircraft can be calculated as \\(2 \\times 44\\).\n\n3. **Determine Distribution of the First Aircraft’s Flights**:\n   - Three-fourths (or \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)) of the first aircraft's flights go to Greece.\n   - The remaining \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of its flights are evenly split between France and Germany.\n\n4. **Calculate Flights to France**:\n   - Since the remaining flights are divided equally between France and Germany, flights to France represent half of the remaining flights.\n\nLet's implement a Python program using the `sympy` library to perform these calculations and ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols\n\n# Step 1: Define the known quantity\ntotal_flights_second_aircraft = 44\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total flights for the first aircraft\ntotal_flights_first_aircraft = total_flights_second_aircraft * 2\n\n# Verify that our interpretation is correct\n# If the second aircraft's flights are half, then first received flights should be twice\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the distribution of flights to Greece\nflights_to_greece = Rational(3, 4) * total_flights_first_aircraft\n\n# Step 4: Calculate remaining flights (to be split between France and Germany)\nremaining_flights = total_flights_first_aircraft - flights_to_greece\n\n# Step 5: Calculate flights to France\nflights_to_france = Rational(1, 2) * remaining_flights\n\n# Print the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France\nprint(flights_to_france)\n```\n\nLet's break down and verify each part of our calculation now:\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n\n- We calculated the total number of flights for the first aircraft as \\(2 \\times 44 = 88\\).\n- Three-fourths of 88 is the number of flights to Greece, calculated as \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\\).\n- This leaves \\(88 - 66 = 22\\) flights to be divided between France and Germany.\n- Since these remaining flights are split evenly, flights to France would be half of 22, which is \\(\\frac{22}{2} = 11\\).\n\nOur calculations have been verified as correct.\n\nThe final solution to the query about the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
