Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost. If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, how much was the total cost?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of Ethan's hand-painted wallpaper after he saves 20% on the materials cost.\n\n**Given Variables:**\n\n1. Ethan's Savings: 20% of the materials cost.\n2. Our goal: To find the total cost.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't provide the actual cost of materials or the total savings in numerical terms. Hence, we need more data to solve this problem directly.\n\nLet's break it down using the structured approach:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Known and Unknown Variables**\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the original materials cost.\n- The savings are \\( 0.2 \\times x \\).\n- Total cost after savings is \\( x - (0.2 \\times x) = 0.8 \\times x \\).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Problem**\n\nIf we knew the value of the total cost after savings or the original materials cost \\( x \\), we could compute the results.\n\nAs we don't have these numbers, if additional information about the initial or resultant cost were provided, we could directly proceed with these calculations.\n\nSince necessary numerical data is missing, let's conclude this problem as unsolvable with the given information.\n\nFinal step:\nSince the problem is unsolvable without specific numerical values for the material cost or savings:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)"
