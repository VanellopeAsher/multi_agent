      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in 12 weeks and then convert that quantity into dozens of eggs.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Number of Days in 12 Weeks:**\n   Since there are 7 days in a week, there are \\(12 \\times 7\\) days in 12 weeks.\n\n2. **Determine the Total Number of Eggs Used:**\n   Claire uses 3 eggs per day, so we'll multiply the total number of days by 3 to find out the total number of eggs she eats.\n\n3. **Convert Total Eggs to Dozens:**\n   Since a dozen equals 12 eggs, we'll divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.\n\nLet's translate this into Python code using the specified format:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of days in 12 weeks\ntotal_days = 12 * 7\n\n# Total number of eggs used\ntotal_eggs = 3 * total_days\n\n# Convert to dozens\ndozens = Rational(total_eggs, 12)\n\nprint(dozens)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Total Days Calculation:**\n   \\(12 \\times 7 = 84\\) days in 12 weeks.\n\n2. **Total Eggs Used:**\n   \\(3 \\times 84 = 252\\) eggs in 12 weeks.\n\n3. **Converting Eggs to Dozens:**\n   \\(\\frac{252}{12} = 21\\) dozens.\n\nAfter verifying each calculation step by hand, the entire solution checks out. Thus:\n\n\\(\\boxed{21}\\)"
