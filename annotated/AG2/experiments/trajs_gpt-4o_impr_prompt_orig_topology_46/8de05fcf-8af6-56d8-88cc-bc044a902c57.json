Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday in terms of how many articles she wrote on Tuesday.\n\n### Key Idea:\nLet's break down the problem using algebra to express the relationships between the articles written on each day and the total hours spent.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Variable Definitions:**\n    - Let \\( x \\) be the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday.\n    - She wrote \\( \\frac{7}{5}x \\) (since \\( 1 + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{7}{5} \\)) articles on Tuesday.\n    - Let \\( y \\) be the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday.\n\n2. **Total Articles and Hours:**\n    - The total hours spent writing is given as 104 hours.\n    - Since each article takes 4 hours, the total number of articles written over the three days can be expressed as:\n      \\[\n      4x + 4\\left(\\frac{7}{5}x\\right) + 4y = 104\n      \\]\n    - Simplifying the equation:\n      \\[\n      4x + \\frac{28}{5}x + 4y = 104\n      \\]\n    - Multiply throughout by 5 to clear the fraction:\n      \\[\n      20x + 28x + 20y = 520\n      \\]\n    - Combine like terms:\n      \\[\n      48x + 20y = 520\n      \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( y \\):**\n    - Simplify the equation by dividing the entire equation by 4:\n      \\[\n      12x + 5y = 130\n      \\]\n    - Solve for \\( y \\):\n      \\[\n      5y = 130 - 12x\n      \\]\n      \\[\n      y = \\frac{130 - 12x}{5}\n      \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the ratio of Wednesday's articles to Tuesday's articles:**\n    - We want the ratio of \\( y \\) to the number of articles on Tuesday, \\( \\frac{7}{5}x \\).\n    - Let's calculate:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{y}{\\frac{7}{5}x} = \\frac{\\frac{130 - 12x}{5}}{\\frac{7}{5}x} = \\frac{130 - 12x}{7x}\n      \\]\n\n5. **Verification:**\n    - Using the remaining values, check integer solutions for \\( x \\):\n\n    Since \\( x \\) must be a whole number such that the values result in a total of integer articles and corresponding hours, let's manually substitute plausible values for \\( x \\) into the equation until we find an integer solution for \\( y \\).\n\nLet's implement this into Python for computation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y', positive=True, integer=True)\n\n# Monday's articles\narticles_monday = 5\n# Articles on Tuesday: 2/5 more than Monday\narticles_tuesday = (7/5) * articles_monday\n\n# Total hours equation: 104 hours\nequation = Eq(4*articles_monday + 4*articles_tuesday + 4*y, 104)\n\n# Solve for y\ny_solution = solve(equation, y)\n# Calculate the ratio Wednesday's to Tuesday's\nratio = y_solution[0] / articles_tuesday\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"The ratio of articles written on Wednesday to Tuesday is:\", ratio)\n```\n\nThis code will solve for \\( y \\) and then output the ratio of articles written on Wednesday to those written on Tuesday.\n\nThe result should be checked to ensure it follows the given constraints before concluding with the boxed final result."

Let's format and confirm this solution properly:\n\n### Verification:\n1. Verify the number of articles written:\n   - Monday: 5 articles.\n   - Tuesday: \\(\\frac{7}{5} \\times 5 = 7\\) articles.\n   - Wednesday: Solve for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and ensure this was correctly computed.\n   - Total check: \\(5 \\times 4 + 7 \\times 4 + y \\times 4 = 104\\).\n\n2.
