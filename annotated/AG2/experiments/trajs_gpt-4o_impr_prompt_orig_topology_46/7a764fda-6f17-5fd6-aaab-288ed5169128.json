Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn November, a toy was $4000. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the final price of the toy after the given percentage increase in December and a subsequent decrease in January.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. Start with the original price in November.\n2. Apply the percentage increase to find the new price in December.\n3. From the December price, apply the percentage decrease to find the final price in January.\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for rational expressions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Define the initial price in November\nnovember_price = 4000\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the price in December after an 80% increase\n# For an 80% increase, we multiply the price by 1 + 80/100\ndecember_price = november_price * Rational(180, 100)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the price in January after a 50% decrease\n# For a 50% decrease, we multiply the price by 1 - 50/100\njanuary_price = december_price * Rational(50, 100)\n\n# Output the final price using the print function\nprint(january_price)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Initial Price:** $4000.\n2. **December Price Calculation:**\n   - 80% increase: \\( 4000 \\times 1.8 = 7200 \\).\n3. **January Price Calculation:**\n   - 50% decrease: \\( 7200 \\times 0.5 = 3600 \\).\n\nThe correct calculation confirms the final price after the adjustments in December and January is $3600.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3600} \\]"
