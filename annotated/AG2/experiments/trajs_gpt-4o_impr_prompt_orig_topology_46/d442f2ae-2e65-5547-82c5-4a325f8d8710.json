Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn goes to the market with $10,000 in his pocket. He buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. He also considers buying a horse for $2000 but decides against it. How much money did he spend at the market?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of how much money John spent at the market, we can address it using a straightforward approach by performing basic arithmetic.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nJohn buys some animals: \n- 3 goats at $500 each.\n- 2 cows at $1500 each.\n\n**Solution Approach:**\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. Since this is a basic arithmetic problem, we can calculate the total expenditure using Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the cost of goats\ncost_of_goats = 3 * 500\n\n# Calculate the cost of cows\ncost_of_cows = 2 * 1500\n\n# Total money spent\ntotal_spent = cost_of_goats + cost_of_cows\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nNow, let's carry out the calculations.\n\n- Cost for 3 goats: \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\) dollars.\n- Cost for 2 cows: \\(2 \\times 1500 = 3000\\) dollars.\n\nTotal money spent is the sum of these two amounts:\n\\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \\]\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. Verify the individual costs:\n   - For goats: \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\), which is correct.\n   - For cows: \\(2 \\times 1500 = 3000\\), which is correct.\n   \n2. Add the costs: \n   - Summing them gives \\(1500 + 3000 = 4500\\), which is verified as correct.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money John spent at the market is \\(\\boxed{4500}\\) dollars."
