Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $20 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 12 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss while keeping the cost per class at $20 or less.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nManny has paid $80 in total for his Karate classes. There are 12 total classes. We need to find out how many classes he can skip so that the average cost per attended class does not exceed $20.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the total number of classes:** 12\n2. **Calculate the condition for cost per class:** The cost per class Manny attends should be exactly $20 or less.\n3. **Set up the inequality for the number of classes Manny can attend:**\n\n   If \\( x \\) is the number of classes Manny attends, the cost per class is given by \\( \\frac{80}{x} \\). We need this to be at most $20:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the inequality:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20 \n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by \\( x \\) to get:\n   \\[\n   80 \\leq 20x \n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 20:\n   \\[\n   4 \\leq x\n   \\]\n\n   This means Manny must attend at least 4 classes.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of classes he can miss:**\n   If Manny must attend at least 4 classes, then he can miss:\n   \\[\n   12 - 4 = 8 \\text{ classes}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, let's verify the solution calculation:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n- If Manny attends exactly 4 classes, the cost per received class will be:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{80}{4} = 20\n  \\]\n- Thus, if he attends more than 4 classes (i.e., 5 to 12), the cost per attended class will be less than $20. Therefore, he meets the condition if he attends as few as 4 classes.\n\nThus, Manny can miss a maximum of \\(\\boxed{8}\\) classes before the cost per class would exceed $20."
