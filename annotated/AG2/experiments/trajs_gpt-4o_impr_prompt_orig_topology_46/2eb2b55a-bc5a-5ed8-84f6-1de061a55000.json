Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of bandages over the three days. Let us break this down step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the initial unknown variable:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of bandages at the beginning of the first day.\n\n2. **Describe the events each day:**\n   - **Day 1:**\n     - Bandages used: 38.\n     - Bandages purchased: 50 (1 large pack).\n     - Bandages at the end of Day 1 = \\( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \\).\n\n   - **Day 2:**\n     - Bandages used: 38 - 10 = 28.\n     - No bandages purchased.\n     - Bandages at the end of Day 2 = \\( (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16 \\).\n\n   - **Day 3:**\n     - Bandages purchased: 100 (2 large packs).\n     - Bandages used: 0.5 * 50 = 25.\n     - Bandages at the end of Day 3 = \\( (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59 \\).\n\n3. **Use the given condition to solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - At the end of the third day, 78 bandages were remaining.\n   - Thus, \\( x + 59 = 78 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Rearrange the equation: \\( x + 59 = 78 \\).\n   - Subtract 59 from both sides: \\( x = 78 - 59 = 19 \\).\n\nNow, let's use Python to verify this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the unknown variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the situation\nequation = Eq(x + 59, 78)\n\n# Solve for x\ninitial_bandages = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(initial_bandages)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Day 1 Calculation:**\n   - Start: \\( x = 19 \\).\n   - Used: 38.\n   - Purchased: 50.\n   - End of Day 1: \\( 19 - 38 + 50 = 31 \\). Calculation is correct.\n\n2. **Day 2 Calculation:**\n   - Start with Day 1 result: 31\n   - Used: 28.\n   - End of Day 2: \\( 31 - 28 = 3 \\). Calculation is correct.\n\n3. **Day 3 Calculation:**\n   - Start with Day 2 result: 3\n   - Purchased: 100.\n   - Used: 25.\n   - End of Day 3: \\( 3 + 100 - 25 = 78 \\). Calculation matches given data.\n\nEverything checks out, and the solution is verified as correct.\n\n\\(\\boxed{19}\\) is the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day."
