On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate Billy's and Sally's earnings and then compare them. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Billy's Hourly Wage:**\n   - Initially, Billy's wage was $10 per hour.\n   - After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, bringing it to $10.50 per hour for the next 10 months.\n   - On his first anniversary (12 months), he received a raise of $1.00 more per hour, making his hourly wage $11.50.\n\n2. **Determine Sally's Hourly Wage:**\n   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so she starts at $10.50 per hour.\n   - After 2 months, she receives a raise of $0.50, making it $11.00 per hour for the next 10 months.\n\n3. **Calculate the Earnings for 20 Hours of Work:**\n   - For Billy: After the first year anniversary, his wage is $11.50 per hour. For 20 hours: \\( 20 \\times 11.50 = 230 \\) dollars.\n   - For Sally: At the end of two months, her wage is $11.00 per hour. For 20 hours: \\( 20 \\times 11.00 = 220 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Earnings:**\n   - The difference in earnings for 20 hours is: \\( 230 - 220 = 10 \\) dollars.\n\nAdding this up, Billy will earn $10 more than Sally for the given 20 hours of work.\n\n```python\n# Python code to perform the calculations as per the explanation\n\n# Billy's and Sally's wages after their respective raises\nbilly_hourly_rate = 11.50\nsally_hourly_rate = 11.00\n\n# Earnings for 20 hours of work\nbilly_earnings = 20 * billy_hourly_rate\nsally_earnings = 20 * sally_hourly_rate\n\n# Difference in earnings\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Print the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nBy the steps we've calculated, Billy earns 10 dollars more than Sally for the 20 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: \\( \\boxed{10} \\)"
