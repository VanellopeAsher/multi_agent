Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

      "content": "To determine how much protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Proportion**: Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and contains 4 grams of protein, we first determine how many grams of protein are in 1 gram of mushrooms.\n\n2. **Calculate in 300 grams**: Using the protein per gram, find out how much protein is in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n\n3. **Calculate for a Week**: Since John consumes 300 grams of mushrooms daily, compute the total amount of protein he gets over a week (7 days).\n\nLet's use Python, specifically the sympy library, to perform this calculation with exact values rather than decimal approximations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Protein per gram in mushrooms\nprotein_per_gram = Rational(4, 150)\n\n# Step 2: Protein in 300 grams of mushrooms\nprotein_in_300g = 300 * protein_per_gram\n\n# Step 3: Protein per week (7 days)\nprotein_per_week = 7 * protein_in_300g\n\n# Print the result\nprint(protein_per_week)\n```\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Calculation of protein per gram**: \n   - 4 grams of protein in 150 grams gives \\( \\frac{4}{150} \\) grams per gram.\n\n2. **For 300 grams of mushrooms**:\n   - Multiplying \\( 300 \\times \\frac{4}{150} \\) simplifies to \\( 300 \\times \\frac{4}{150} = 8 \\) grams of protein.\n\n3. **Over 7 days**:\n   - \\( 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\) grams of protein over a week.\n\nThe math matches our expectations at each step. Therefore, with confidence, we conclude:\n\n\\(\\boxed{56}\\) grams of protein per week."
