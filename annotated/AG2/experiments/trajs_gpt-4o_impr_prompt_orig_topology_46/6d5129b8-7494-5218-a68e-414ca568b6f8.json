Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16. What will be her age after 4 years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps.\n\n1. **Identify Charmaine's Current Age:**\n   - The problem states that in 12 years, Charmaine will be 16 years old.\n   - Therefore, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.\n\n2. **Calculate Age After 4 Years:**\n   - Once we know Charmaine's current age, we can find out how old she will be in 4 years by adding 4 to her current age.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let's define the variables\ncurrent_age = symbols('current_age')\n\n# Equation to solve for Charmaine's current age\nequation = Eq(current_age + 12, 16)\n\n# Solving the equation\ncurrent_age_value = solve(equation, current_age)[0]\n\n# Calculate Charmaine's age after 4 years\nage_after_4_years = current_age_value + 4\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Charmaine's age after 4 years will be: {age_after_4_years}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify our steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Current Age:**\n   - Charmaine's current age is solved using the equation: \\( \\text{current age} + 12 = 16 \\)\n   - Solving this equation gives us a current age of \\( 16 - 12 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Age After 4 Years:**\n   - Add 4 years to the current age of 4, resulting in \\( 4 + 4 = 8 \\).\n\nThe solution works out correctly. Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old after 4 years.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
