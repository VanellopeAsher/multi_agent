Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another inches in the third week and the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inces tall. How many inches did the beanstalk grow in the third week?"

      "content": "Let's solve this problem using a step-by-step process.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Initial Height**: After the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.\n2. **Second Week Growth**: The beanstalk doubles in height, so at the end of the second week, it should be \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches tall.\n3. **Unknown Third Week Growth**: We know the beanstalk is 10 inches tall by the end of the third week. We need to find out how many inches it grew during the third week.\n\nTo calculate the growth during the third week, we can use the following equation for the height at the end of the third week:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height at end of third week} = \\text{Height at end of second week} + \\text{Growth during third week}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n10 = 6 + \\text{Growth during third week}\n\\]\n\nThus, solving for the growth during the third week:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Growth during third week} = 10 - 6\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate it using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculating growth in third week\nsecond_week_height = 6  # Height after the second week\nthird_week_final_height = 10  # Height after the third week\n\n# Growth during third week\ngrowth_third_week = third_week_final_height - second_week_height\nprint(growth_third_week)\n```\n\nNow let's verify the solution:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Initial height at the end of week 1**: 3 inches.\n2. **Height at the end of week 2 (after doubling)**: \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches.\n3. **Given final height at the end of week 3**: 10 inches.\n4. **Calculated growth in third week**: \\(10 - 6 = 4\\) inches.\n\nThe calculations match the expected conditions given in the problem.\n\nThus, the beanstalk grew \\(\\boxed{4}\\) inches in the third week."
