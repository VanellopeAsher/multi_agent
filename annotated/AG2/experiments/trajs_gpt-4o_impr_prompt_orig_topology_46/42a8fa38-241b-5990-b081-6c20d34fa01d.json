Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost based on the number of seed packets purchased and their individual prices.\n\nThe approach will be case 1: Direct Python Solution, because it involves straightforward arithmetic.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of tomato seed packets.\n2. Calculate the cost of celery seed packets.\n3. Add these two costs to get the total amount spent.\n\nLet's implement this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Given data\ntomato_packets = 20\ncelery_packets = 80\nprice_tomato_packet = 40\nprice_celery_packet = 30\n\n# Calculate total cost for each type of seed\ntotal_cost_tomato = tomato_packets * price_tomato_packet\ntotal_cost_celery = celery_packets * price_celery_packet\n\n# Calculate the overall total cost\ntotal_amount_spent = total_cost_tomato + total_cost_celery\n\n# Output the total amount spent\nprint(total_amount_spent)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we'll get the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on purchasing seed packets.\n\nLet's verify the solution now:\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. Calculate the cost for the 20 tomato seed packets:\n   - \\(20 \\times 40 = 800\\)\n\n2. Calculate the cost for the 80 celery seed packets:\n   - \\(80 \\times 30 = 2400\\)\n\n3. Calculate the total spent:\n   - \\(800 + 2400 = 3200\\)\n\nSince everything checks out, Mrs. Rylan spent a total of \\( \\boxed{3200} \\) dollars on seed packets."
