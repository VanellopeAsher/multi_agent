Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the number of calls Tim deals with per day and then extend that to calculate for his entire 5-day work week, considering the additional hours on Friday.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Find the number of calls Tim deals with from Monday to Thursday:**\n    - Tim works for 6 hours every day from Monday to Thursday.\n    - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so each day, Tim works for \\( 6 \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 360 \\, \\text{minutes/day} \\).\n    - It takes him 15 minutes to handle one call. Thus, the number of calls he handles in a day is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{360 \\, \\text{minutes/day}}{15 \\, \\text{minutes/call}}\n      \\]\n2. **Find the number of calls Tim deals with on Friday:**\n    - On Friday, he works for an additional 2 hours, making it an 8-hour workday.\n    - Therefore, he works for \\( 8 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 480 \\, \\text{minutes} \\) on Friday.\n    - The number of calls he handles on Friday is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{480 \\, \\text{minutes}}{15 \\, \\text{minutes/call}}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Sum up the total calls for the week:**\n   - Calculate the total number of calls from Monday to Friday.\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the number of calls per day from Monday to Thursday\ntotal_minutes_per_day = 6 * 60  # 6 hours in minutes\nminutes_per_call = 15\ncalls_per_day = total_minutes_per_day / minutes_per_call\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of calls on Friday\nfriday_minutes = 8 * 60  # 8 hours in minutes\ncalls_on_friday = friday_minutes / minutes_per_call\n\n# Step 3: Calculate total calls for the week\ntotal_calls_monday_thursday = calls_per_day * 4  # 4 days\ntotal_calls_week = total_calls_monday_thursday + calls_on_friday\n\n# Output the result\nprint(Rational(total_calls_week))\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. Each weekday from Monday to Thursday, he handles \\( \\frac{360}{15} = 24 \\) calls.\n2. On Friday, he handles \\( \\frac{480}{15} = 32 \\) calls.\n3. Total for Monday to Thursday = \\( 24 \\times 4 = 96 \\) calls.\n4. Total for the week = \\( 96 + 32 = 128 \\) calls.\n\nThe calculation has been verified accurately. Hence, the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{128}\n\\]"
