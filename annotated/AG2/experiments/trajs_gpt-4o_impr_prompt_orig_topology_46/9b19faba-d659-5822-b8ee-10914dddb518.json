Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings over three days based on the quantities of gingerbread and apple pie sold. We will use the given information to derive expressions for the number of boxes sold each day, and then calculate the total earnings.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the problem:**\n   - On Saturday:\n     - Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.\n     - The number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday is 4 fewer than on Sunday.\n   - On Sunday:\n     - Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which sums up to \\(10 + 5 = 15\\) boxes.\n     - Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie.\n   - On Monday:\n     - Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread.\n     - Sunny sold 4 boxes of apple pie.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday:**\n   - If Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, then on Saturday he sold \\(15 - 4 = 11\\) boxes.\n\n3. **Calculate the earnings:**\n   - Sunny's earnings come from gingerbread and apple pie over the three days.\n\nBelow is the Python code to calculate these earnings:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic computation, though not directly needed in this simple calculation\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Prices\ncost_gingerbread = 6\ncost_apple_pie = 15\n\n# Sales on Saturday\ngb_saturday = 10\nap_saturday = 15 - 4  # 11\n\n# Sales on Sunday\ngb_sunday = 10 + 5  # 15\nap_sunday = 15\n\n# Sales on Monday\ngb_monday = 2\nap_monday = 4\n\n# Total gingerbread and apple pie earnings for each day\nearnings_saturday = (gb_saturday * cost_gingerbread) + (ap_saturday * cost_apple_pie)\nearnings_sunday = (gb_sunday * cost_gingerbread) + (ap_sunday * cost_apple_pie)\nearnings_monday = (gb_monday * cost_gingerbread) + (ap_monday * cost_apple_pie)\n\n# Total earnings over three days\ntotal_earnings = earnings_saturday + earnings_sunday + earnings_monday\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nLet's verify our calculations:\n\n- **Saturday:** \\(10 \\times 6 + 11 \\times 15 = 60 + 165 = 225\\) dollars.\n- **Sunday:** \\(15 \\times 6 + 15 \\times 15 = 90 + 225 = 315\\) dollars.\n- **Monday:** \\(2 \\times 6 + 4 \\times 15 = 12 + 60 = 72\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total earnings are \\(225 + 315 + 72 = 612\\) dollars.\n\n**VERIFICATION STEPS:**\n1. Calculated number of boxes sold for each day correctly.\n2. Multiplied number of boxes by their respective costs.\n3. Added earnings for each day to find the total earnings.\n4. Rechecked all calculations for any potential errors.\n\nThus, the total amount of money Sunny earned by selling gingerbread and apple pie over the three days is \\( \\boxed{612} \\) dollars."
