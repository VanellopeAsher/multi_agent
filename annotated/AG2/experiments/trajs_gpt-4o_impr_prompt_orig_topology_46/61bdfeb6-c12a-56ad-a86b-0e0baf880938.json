Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSamwell owns an appliance store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, one-fifth are projection TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use the following approach:\n\n**Key Idea:**\nThe total number of TVs sold is divided into different categories based on the given fractions. We'll first calculate the number in each category (Smart TVs, Analog TVs, and Projection TVs), and the remainder will be the OLED TVs.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Let \\( T \\) be the total number of TVs sold, which is 40.\n\n2. Calculate the number of Smart TVs sold: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( T \\).\n\n3. Calculate the number of Analog TVs sold: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of \\( T \\).\n\n4. Calculate the number of Projection TVs sold: \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of \\( T \\).\n\n5. Subtract these numbers from the total to get the number of OLED TVs.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the `sympy` library for precise fraction calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of TVs sold\nT = 40\n\n# Calculate the number of each type of TV sold\nsmart_tvs = Rational(1, 4) * T\nanalog_tvs = Rational(1, 8) * T\nprojection_tvs = Rational(1, 5) * T\n\n# Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold\noled_tvs = T - (smart_tvs + analog_tvs + projection_tvs)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(oled_tvs)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate the number of Smart TVs: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10 \\).\n2. Calculate the number of Analog TVs: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times 40 = 5 \\).\n3. Calculate the number of Projection TVs: \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 40 = 8 \\).\n\nSum of Smart TVs, Analog TVs, and Projection TVs = \\( 10 + 5 + 8 = 23 \\).\n\n4. OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Smart + Analog + Projection TVs) = \\( 40 - 23 = 17 \\).\n\nEvery step checks out correctly. Hence, the number of OLED TVs sold is \\( \\boxed{17} \\)."
