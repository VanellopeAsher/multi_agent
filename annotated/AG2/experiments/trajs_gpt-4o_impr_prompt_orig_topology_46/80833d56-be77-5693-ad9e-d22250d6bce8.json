Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 100 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine John's average speed, given his running schedule.\n\nGiven Variables:\n- Total distance John runs each week: 100 miles\n- Number of days John runs per week: 3 days\n- Time spent running on the first day: 10 hours\n- Time spent running on each of the other two days: 5 hours (half of the first day)\n\nApproach: \nWe need to determine John's speed, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. Calculate the total time John spends running each week.\n   - For the first day: 10 hours\n   - For the second and third days: 5 hours each\n   - Total time = \\(10 + 5 + 5 = 20\\) hours.\n\n2. Use the total distance and total time to calculate the average speed.\n\nLet's implement the calculation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Calculate total distance and total time\ntotal_distance = 100  # miles\ntime_first_day = 10  # hours\ntime_other_days = 5  # hours per day\ntotal_time = time_first_day + 2 * time_other_days  # 10 + 5 + 5\n\n# Calculate average speed\naverage_speed = Fraction(total_distance, total_time)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"John's average speed is\", average_speed, \"miles per hour.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- **Step 1**: Calculate total running time.\n  - 1st day = 10 hours\n  - 2nd and 3rd day = 5 + 5 hours = 10 hours\n  - Total = 20 hours\n\n- **Step 2**: Calculate speed.\n  - Distance = 100 miles\n  - Time = 20 hours\n  - Speed = 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles per hour\n\nThe calculation aligns with our expected outcome. The speed is consistent with the total distance and time provided.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{5}\\)"
