Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3.

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we'll use a Direct Python Solution in which we'll calculate the total cost and then determine how many hours George needs to work to cover this cost after considering his deposit. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the implants:** \n   - The cost for each implant is $2000.5.\n   - Porcelain crown for one implant adds an extra $500.5.\n   - George needs two implants, so the base cost for both is 2 * $2000.5.\n   - The total cost, including the crown, will be calculated by adding the cost for both implants and the additional porcelain crown cost.\n\n2. **Subtract the deposit:** \n   - George has already paid a $600 deposit.\n\n3. **Calculate work hours needed:**\n   - After finding the remaining balance, divide this by his hourly wage of $15.3 to find out how many hours he needs to work to make up the required amount.\n\nLet's write the code using these steps.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary functions or libraries\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the costs and earnings\nimplant_base_cost = Rational(2000.5)\ncrown_extra_cost = Rational(500.5)\nnumber_of_implants = 2\ndeposit_amount = Rational(600)\nhourly_wage = Rational(15.3)\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_implant_cost = number_of_implants * implant_base_cost\ntotal_cost = total_implant_cost + crown_extra_cost\n\n# Calculate the remaining balance after the deposit\nremaining_balance = total_cost - deposit_amount\n\n# Calculate the number of hours George needs to work\nhours_needed = remaining_balance / hourly_wage\n\n# Output the result, ensuring the form required\nprint(hours_needed)\n```\n\nNext, we proceed with verifying the step-by-step solution:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Implant Cost:**\n   - Each implant is $2000.5, so two implants cost $2000.5 * 2 = $4001\n\n2. **Add the Porcelain Crown Additional Cost:**\n   - The crown has an extra cost of $500.5.\n\n   So, the total cost = $4001 + $500.5 = $4501.5.\n\n3. **Subtract the Deposit:**\n   - Remaining balance = Total cost - Deposit = $4501.5 - $600 = $3901.5\n\n4. **Calculate Hours Needed Based on Hourly Wage:**\n   - Hours needed = Remaining balance / Hourly wage = $3901.5 / $15.3 ≈ 255\n\nAll calculations align, correctly confirming the steps we followed. The final answer is boxed and presented in a proper format. \n\nGeorge needs to work 255 hours to afford the dental work."
