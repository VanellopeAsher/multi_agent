You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total amount of time John spent on vacation and then determine the time he spent sightseeing based on the percentage given.\n\n### Key Idea\n\nSince the question involves percentages and total time, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total time John spent on various activities.\n2. Determine how much time was spent sightseeing by using the percentage given.\n\nLet's proceed with these calculations step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate Boating and Swimming Time:**\n\n   - Boating time = 60 hours\n   - Swimming time = Half of boating time = 60 hours / 2\n\n2. **Calculate Show Watching Time:**\n\n   - Total time spent watching shows = Number of shows × Duration per show\n   - Shows watched = 30\n   - Duration per show = 20 hours\n   - Total show time = 30 × 20\n\n3. **Total Time Calculation:**\n\n   The total time spent (based on the problem statement) is such that the time spent watching shows accounts for 30% of it. Let's denote the total time as `T`.\n\n   - 30% of `T` = Total show time calculated above\n\n4. **Solve for `T`:**\n\n   - Total time `T` = (Total show time) / 0.3\n\n5. **Calculate Sightseeing Time:**\n\n   - 40% of `T` is the time spent sightseeing.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n\n   We'll verify each calculation step to ensure they are consistent with the problem statement.\n\nNow, let's perform these calculations using Python for accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Defining the total time T\nT = symbols('T', positive=True)\n\n# Calculations\nboating_time = 60  # in hours\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\n\n# Shows\nnumber_of_shows = 30\nduration_per_show = 20\ntotal_show_time = number_of_shows * duration_per_show\n\n# Setting up equation for total time T based on show watching time being 30% of total time\nequation = Eq(total_show_time, Rational(3, 10) * T)\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Sightseeing time is 40% of total time\nsightseeing_time = Rational(4, 10) * total_time\n\nprint(f\"Total time spent sightseeing: {sightseeing_time} hours\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate Each Component:**\n   - Boating time: 60 hours\n   - Swimming time: 30 hours\n   - Total show time: 600 hours\n\n2. **Total Time Equation:**\n   - 30% of total time `T` = 600 hours\n   - Solving `0.3 * T = 600` gives `T = 2000` hours\n\n3. **Sightseeing Time Calculation:**\n   - Sightseeing time = 40% of 2000 hours = 800 hours\n\nAll computations match expectations from the problem statement. The solution is verified.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]"

Just in case, let's re-evaluate the solution to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n\n### Re-Evaluation and Conclusion\n\n1. **Component Calculation:**\n   - **Boating Time:** 60 hours\n   - **Swimming Time:** 30 hours\n\n2. **Show Watching Time:**\n   - Number of shows: 30\n   - Duration per show: 20 hours\n   - Total show watching time = 30 × 20 = 600 hours\n\n3. **Total Time `T`:**\n   - The problem states watching shows takes up 30% of John's total vacation time.\n   - Therefore, 0.3 × `T` = 600 hours\n   - Solving for `T`: \\( T = \\frac{600}{0.3} = 2000 \\) hours\n\n4. **Sightseeing Time:**\n   - Sightseeing takes up 40% of the total time.\n   - Sightseeing time = 0.4 × 2000 = 800 hours\n\nThus, John spent a total of 800 hours sightseeing. This solution checks out as we have verified every step and found the calculations consistent with the given conditions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]\n\nJohn spent 800 hours sightseeing during his vacation."
