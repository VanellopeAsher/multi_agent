Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLast night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to establish a system of equations based on the given information and use Python to solve it. \n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the number of wolves Rick killed last night.\n   - Let \\( c \\) be the number of cougars Rick killed last night.\n\n2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**\n   - We are told Rick killed ten wolves last night, so \\( w = 10 \\).\n   - We need to find how many cougars Rick killed last night, i.e., \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Today's Kills:**\n   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today: \\( 3c \\).\n   - Rick also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night today, so today's cougar kills are \\( c - 3 \\).\n\n4. **Total Animals Killed:**\n   - Total animals killed today: \\( 3c \\) (wolves) + \\( c - 3 \\) (cougars).\n\nWe need to calculate the total number of animals killed by Rick, including both nights.\n\nLet's proceed to solve and compute:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for the number of cougars killed last night\nc = symbols('c', integer=True)\n\n# Last night's kills\nw_night = 10  # Rick killed 10 wolves\n# Define the equation for today's kills\nw_today = 3 * c  # Wolves today\nc_today = c - 3  # Cougars today\n\n# Total animals killed altogether\ntotal_animals = w_night + c + w_today + c_today\n\n# Solve the equation: total_animals calculation, we need to express c_today in terms of c\n# However, there are no received equations to solve, it's just an evaluation\n animals_killed = w_night + c + 3 * c + (c - 3)\n\n# Print the expression for the total number of animals killed\nprint(\"Total number of animals killed:\", animals_killed.simplify())\n```\n\nUpon executing this Python code, we will derive the total number of animals killed by combining last night's kills with today's kills in terms of the number of cougars \\( c \\) killed last night.\n\nNow, let's manually verify these steps and summarize:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n- Last night: 10 wolves + \\( c \\) cougars\n- Today:\n  - Wolves: \\( 3c \\)\n  - Cougars: \\( c - 3 \\)\n- Total kills: \\( 10 + c + 3c + (c - 3) \\)\n- Simplifying: \\( 10 + c + 3c + c - 3 = 10 + 5c - 3 \\)\n- Thus, the total number of animals killed is \\( 7 + 5c \\).\n\nSince \\( c \\) is unknown and no further constraints are provided here, \\( 7 + 5c \\) is the total number of animals killed in terms of cougars killed last night.\n\nHowever, to find numerical output, we would need specific values or constraints related to \\( c \\).\n\nThus the final answer in terms of known variables is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7 + 5c} \\]"

The equation should correctly represent the problem statement.\n\nLet's verify the calculations:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n- Last night: 10 wolves + \\( c \\) cougars\n- Today:\n  - Wolves: \\( 3c \\)\n  - Cougars: \\( c - 3 \\)\n- Total kills: \\( 10 + c + 3c + (c - 3) \\)\n- Simplify: \\( 10 + c + 3c + c - 3 = 10 + 5c - 3 = 7 + 5c \\)\n\nThus, the total number of animals Rick killed is expressed as \\( 7 + 5c \\), which is the final result and satisfies the problem conditions.\n\nThe final answer, in terms of \\( c \\), is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7 + 5c} \\]"
