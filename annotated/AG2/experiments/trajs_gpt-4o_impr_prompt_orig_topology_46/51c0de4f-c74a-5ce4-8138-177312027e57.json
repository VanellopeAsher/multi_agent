Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we must determine the contribution of Walter's friend, given the donations from Walter's neighbors, the online fund, and the lawyer. Let's go through this step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Donations Without the Friend:**\n   - Walter collected $500 from his neighbors.\n   - Walter collected $1500 from the online fund.\n   - Total donations without the friend's contribution would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total donation (without friend)} = \\$500 + \\$1500 = \\$2000\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Lawyer's Contribution:**\n   - Walter's lawyer decides to donate three times the combined amount of everyone else's donations, including Walter's friend.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the amount Walter's friend donated.\n   - The total donation without the lawyer would be \\( \\$2000 + x \\).\n   - Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is \\( 3 \\times (\\$2000 + x) \\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - We know that the lawyer contributed $6600 in total.\n   - Thus, we set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times (\\$2000 + x) = \\$6600\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\) (friend's donation):**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for the lawyer's contribution\nequation = Eq(3 * (2000 + x), 6600)\n\n# Solve for x\nfriend_contribution = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the friend's contribution in exact form\nprint(friend_contribution)\n```\n\nThe above code will calculate Walter's friend's contribution based on the given conditions.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Verify the Lawyer's Contribution:**\n   - Substitute the friend's contribution back into the equation to recheck the lawyer's donation:\n   - Lawyer's contribution should be equal to $6600.\n   \n2. **Recalculate Total Donations:**\n   - Total donations including the friend's contribution:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total (without lawyer)} = \\$2000 + \\text{Friend's contribution}\n     \\]\n   - Lawyer's contribution should validate as \\( 3 \\times (\\text{Total (without lawyer)}) = \\$6600 \\).\n\nOnce verified, we can ensure the solution is correct and present it in the correct format:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Friend's contribution}} \\]\n\nLet's retrieve the specific amount for the complete answer."
