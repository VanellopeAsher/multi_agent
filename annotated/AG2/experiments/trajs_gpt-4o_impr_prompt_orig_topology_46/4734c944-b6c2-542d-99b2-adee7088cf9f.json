Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how Peter can spend his $70 equally over a week. We'll calculate the total number of action figures Peter can buy by dividing his total budget by the number of days, and then checking how many of each type of action figure he can purchase.\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations. We'll follow the given query requirements and use the sympy library if necessary.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total amount of money Peter has\ntotal_money = 70\n\n# Number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Amount Peter should spend each day\ndaily_spending = total_money / days_in_week\n\n# Cost of wooden action figures (Sunday to Wednesday)\nwooden_cost = 5\n\n# Cost of plastic action figures (Thursday to Saturday)\nplastic_cost = 2.5\n\n# Sunday to Wednesday\nwooden_days = 4  # Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n# Thursday to Saturday\nplastic_days = 3  # Thursday, Friday, Saturday\n\n# Calculate the number of wooden action figures bought\nwooden_figures = (daily_spending * wooden_days) / wooden_cost\n\n# Calculate the number of plastic action figures bought\nplastic_figures = (daily_spending * plastic_days) / plastic_cost\n\n# Calculate the total number of action figures\ntotal_figures = wooden_figures + plastic_figures\n\n# Convert to fractions to match the required output format\ntotal_figures_fraction = Rational(total_figures)\n\n# Print results as fractions\nprint(f'Total number of action figures: {total_figures_fraction}')\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Check if the total weekly money ($70) is divided correctly over 7 days:\n   - Daily spending: $70 / 7 = $10 per day.\n   \n2. Compute action figures for Sunday to Wednesday:\n   - Daily spending: $10\n   - Wooden action figures' cost: $5\n   - Total wooden figures = (4 days * $10) / $5 = 8 wooden figures\n\n3. Compute action figures for Thursday to Saturday:\n   - Daily spending: $10\n   - Plastic action figures' cost: $2.5\n   - Total plastic figures = (3 days * $10) / $2.5 = 12 plastic figures\n\n4. Total number of figures = 8 wooden + 12 plastic = 20 action figures\n\nAfter reviewing and verifying each step:\n\n\\[\\boxed{20}\\]\n"

Let's go through the solution again and calculate step-by-step without skipping any details.\n\nPeter has a total of $70 to spend equally over 7 days of the week.\n\n1. **Calculate Daily Spending**:\n   - Total money = $70\n   - Number of days = 7\n   - Daily spending = Total money / Number of days = $70 / 7 = $10 per day\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Wooden Action Figures (Sunday to Wednesday)**:\n   - Wooden action figures cost = $5 each\n   - Days Peter buys wooden figures = 4 (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday)\n   - Money spent on wooden figures = 4 days × $10 = $40\n   - Number of wooden figures = Money spent on wooden figures / Cost per wooden figure\n   - Number of wooden figures = $40 / $5 = 8 wooden figures\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Plastic Action Figures (Thursday to Saturday)**:\n   - Plastic action figures cost = $2.5 each\n   - Days Peter buys plastic figures = 3 (Thursday, Friday, Saturday)\n   - Money spent on plastic figures = 3 days × $10 = $30\n   - Number of plastic figures = Money spent on plastic figures / Cost per plastic figure\n   - Number of plastic figures = $30 / $2.5 = 12 plastic figures\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Action Figures**:\n   - Total figures = Number of wooden figures + Number of plastic figures\n   - Total figures = 8 + 12 = 20 action figures\n\nThus, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of \\(\\boxed{20}\\) action figures."
