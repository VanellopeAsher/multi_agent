Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJoey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how the scores of Joey and Marcy compare after Joey scores his points and Marcy scores hers. Let's break down the problem into key steps:\n\n1. Start with the given scores:\n   - Joey has an initial score of 214 points.\n   - Marcy has an initial score of 225 points.\n\n2. Calculate Marcy's new score:\n   - Marcy scores an additional 10 points, giving her a new total of \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\) points.\n\n3. Let \\( x \\) represent the number of points Joey scores during his turn. His new score will then be \\( 214 + x \\).\n\n4. For Joey to be winning by a certain number of points, calculate the difference between Joey's and Marcy’s scores:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = (214 + x) - 235\n   \\]\n\n5. We want to determine how many points Joey is winning by. This can be expressed as the difference:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Winning Points} = 214 + x - 235\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this expression:\n   \\[\n   = x - 21\n   \\]\n\nThis expression gives the number of points by which Joey is winning, dependent on the value of \\( x \\).\n\nNow let's write a simple Python solution to compute this difference given a specific value for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the variable for Joey's score increment\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Initial scores\njoey_initial_score = 214\nmarcy_initial_score = 225\n\n# Marcy's new score after gaining 10 points\nmarcy_new_score = marcy_initial_score + 10\n\n# Expression for Joey's new score with an unknown increment 'x'\njoey_new_score = joey_initial_score + x\n\n# Calculate the points by how much Joey is winning\nwinning_points_expr = joey_new_score - marcy_new_score\n\n# Simplify the expression\nwinning_points_simplified = simplify(winning_points_expr)\n\n# Print the simplified result\nprint(f\"Joey is winning by {winning_points_simplified} points.\")\n```\n\nTo find out explicitly how many points Joey is winning by, you would substitute \\( x \\) with the actual points Joey scored during his turn, and then evaluate the expression for \\( x \\).\n\nWe isolate the winning calculation as \\( x - 21 \\), which shows that Joey will be winning by the difference of what he scored less 21.\n\nSince the problem does not specify exactly how many points Joey scores, we stop at this general equation and express it in boxed form for clarity on the solution process.\n\nUltimately:\n\\[ \\boxed{x - 21} \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Start with original scores: Joey \\( 214 \\), Marcy \\( 225 \\).\n2. After Marcy scores 10 points, her total is \\( 235 \\).\n3. Joey’s total becomes \\( 214 + x \\).\n4. Calculate the difference: \\( (214 + x) - 235 = x - 21 \\).\n\nThus, the verification confirms that Joey wins by the number of points \\( x - 21 \\)."

Unfortunately, the problem does not provide this information directly. Assuming the problem expects us to continue nevertheless, without a specific numeric value for \\( x \\), any further solution would still result in an expression depending on \\( x \\).\n\nIf we need to ascertain exactly by how many points Joey is winning with a specific numeric result, we would first need to specify the value of \\( x \\). For example, if Joey scored 30 points during his turn, we can plug this into our expression:\n\n1. Let's assume Joey scored 30 points: \\( x = 30 \\).\n\nReplace \\( x \\) in \\( x - 21 \\) with 30:\n\n\\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, if Joey scored 30 points, he is winning by:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]\n\nHowever, without an explicit value for \\( x \\), this will remain in a variable form \\( x - 21 \\). Could you please provide the points Joey scored, or should we continue treating the result as \\( x - 21 \\)?"
