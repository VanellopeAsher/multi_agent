      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to consider how much Stephen will have repaid after 11 months and then calculate the remaining amount including the interest for the twelfth month. Here's how we can approach it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Debt with Interest**:\n   - Initial Debt: $300\n   - Interest Rate: 2%\n   - Total Debt = Initial Debt + (Interest Rate * Initial Debt)\n\n2. **Calculate Total Payments Made in 11 Months**:\n   - Monthly Payment: $25\n   - Total Paid in 11 months = 11 * Monthly Payment\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month**:\n   - Remaining Amount = Total Debt - Total Paid in 11 months\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial values\ninitial_debt = 300\ninterest_rate = Rational(2, 100)  # 2%\n\n# Total Debt with Interest\ntotal_debt = initial_debt + interest_rate * initial_debt\n\n# Payments made in 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\npayments_11_months = 11 * monthly_payment\n\n# Remaining Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month\nremaining_amount = total_debt - payments_11_months\n\n# Output the result\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\n### Calculation Breakdown:\n- **Initial Debt with Interest**: \\(300 + 0.02 \\times 300 = 306\\)\n- **Payments over 11 months**: \\(11 \\times 25 = 275\\)\n- **Remaining Amount**: \\(306 - 275 = 31\\)\n\nThus, the amount Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases, is \\(31\\).\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Interest Calculation**: \\(2\\%\\) of $300 is $6. Hence, total debt is $306.\n2. **Payments in 11 months**: $25 per month leads to a total of $275 over 11 months.\n3. **Final Calculation**: $306 - $275 equals $31.\n\nAfter verifying all steps, the solution seems consistent and correct.\n\n\\(\\boxed{31}\\)"
