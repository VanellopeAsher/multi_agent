Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's work through it using a structured approach.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nWe need to determine the total number of unicorns worldwide, given specific proportions related to Scottish unicorns.\n\n**Approach:**\nThis problem can be solved using a series of calculations, so we'll use a direct Python solution with symbolic math to help us work with fractional numbers.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n1. Define the variables: \n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of unicorns in the world.\n   - A third of them are in the Scottish Highlands: \\(\\frac{x}{3}\\).\n   - Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female.\n\n2. Set up the equations:\n   - If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, then \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{x}{3} = 6\\).\n\n3. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\nNow, let's write Python code to solve the equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq((2/3) * (x/3), 6)\n\n# Solve for the total number of unicorns\ntotal_unicorns = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate the number of unicorns left in the world excluding those in the Scottish Highlands\nunicorns_left = total_unicorns - (total_unicorns / 3)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(unicorns_left)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n1. The equation \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{x}{3} = 6 \\) accurately represents the problem given that two-thirds of a third of total unicorns are female in Scotland.\n2. Solving this equation gives us the total number of unicorns in the world.\n3. Subtracting the number of unicorns in Scotland (which is \\(\\frac{x}{3}\\)) from the total gives us the number of unicorns left in the world.\n\nLet's run the code above to obtain the solution. \n\nOnce the code is verified and correct, we will box the final result."

We calculated that there are a total of 27 unicorns in the world by solving the equation \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{x}{3} = 6 \\).\n2. Subtracting the unicorns in Scotland (\\( \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\)), we find that there are \\( 27 - 9 = 18 \\) unicorns left in the rest of the world.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is \\(\\boxed{18}\\)."
