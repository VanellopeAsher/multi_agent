Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces, and anther one that had 125 pieces than the 500 piece one.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll compute the total number of Lego pieces from all the sets combined. We are given details about four different Lego sets, and we need to sum up the number of pieces from each set to find the total.\n\n**Let's break down the problem step by step:**\n\n1. The first Lego set has 500 pieces.\n\n2. The second Lego set has 3 times the pieces of the 500-piece set.\n   - Calculate: \\(3 \\times 500\\).\n\n3. The third Lego set has \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) the number of pieces of the 500-piece set.\n   - Calculate: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 500\\).\n\n4. The fourth Lego set has 125 more pieces than the 500-piece set.\n   - Calculate: \\(500 + 125\\).\n\n**Using Python to compute the total number of blocks:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the number of pieces in each set\nset1_pieces = 500\nset2_pieces = 3 * set1_pieces\nset3_pieces = Rational(1, 4) * set1_pieces\nset4_pieces = set1_pieces + 125\n\n# Calculate the total number of pieces\ntotal_pieces = set1_pieces + set2_pieces + set3_pieces + set4_pieces\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_pieces)\n```\n\nNow, let's walk through the calculations:\n\n- First set: 500 pieces.\n- Second set: \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\) pieces.\n- Third set: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125\\) pieces.\n- Fourth set: \\(500 + 125 = 625\\) pieces.\n\nSumming the number of pieces from all sets:\n\n\\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 + 625 \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\n\\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \\]\n\\[ 2000 + 125 = 2125 \\]\n\\[ 2125 + 625 = 2750 \\]\n\nThe total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 2750.\n\nLet's verify the solution.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Check each calculation:\n   - Second set: \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\) ✔️\n   - Third set: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125\\) ✔️\n   - Fourth set: \\(500 + 125 = 625\\) ✔️\n\n2. Check the total sum:\n   - \\(500 + 1500 + 125 + 625 = 2750\\) ✔️\n\nAll calculations are correct and verified step by step.\n\nThus, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is \\(\\boxed{2750}\\)."
