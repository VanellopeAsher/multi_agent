Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 60 feet, and the second tree has a height of 50 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can take a straightforward mathematical approach using Python. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. We know the shortest tree's height is 60 feet.\n2. The second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest tree. Therefore, its height is \\(60 + 50\\) feet.\n3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.\n\nLet's use these steps to calculate the height of the tallest tree:\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Determine the height of the second tree**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of second tree} = 60 + 50 = 110 \\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined height} = 60 + 110 = 170 \\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the height of the tallest tree** (which is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \\times 170 = 340 \\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\nNow, I'll write a Python program using the sympy library to ensure our solution's correctness.\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols\n\n# Define the heights of the trees\nshortest_tree = 60\nsecond_tree = shortest_tree + 50\n\n# Calculate combined height\ncombined_height = shortest_tree + second_tree\n\n# Calculate the height of the tallest tree\ntallest_tree = 2 * combined_height\n\n# Output the height of the tallest tree\nprint(tallest_tree)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verification of Calculations**:\n   - Second tree calculation: \\(60 + 50 = 110\\) feet, correct.\n   - Combined height of the two trees: \\(60 + 110 = 170\\) feet, correct.\n   - Tallest tree height calculation: \\(2 \\times 170 = 340\\) feet, correct.\n\nEach step matches our expectations and calculations.\n\nThus, the height of the tallest tree is \\(\\boxed{340}\\) feet."
