Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $15.00 each and a ballpen at $5.00 each. William bought fifty notebooks and ten ballpens. How much did he spend in all?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and ballpens that William bought. Let's break this down into a straightforward calculation.\n\nKey Idea:\nSince we know the prices of the notebooks and ballpens, we can multiply these by the quantities purchased to find the total spending.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the total cost for the notebooks.\n2. Calculate the total cost for the ballpens.\n3. Add the two totals to find the overall amount spent.\n\nLet's represent this process using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Prices of items\nnotebook_price = 15.00\nballpen_price = 5.00\n\n# Quantities of items purchased\nnotebooks_bought = 50\nballpens_bought = 10\n\n# Total cost calculations\ntotal_notebook_cost = notebook_price * notebooks_bought\ntotal_ballpen_cost = ballpen_price * ballpens_bought\n\n# Overall total spent\ntotal_spent = total_notebook_cost + total_ballpen_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Total amount spent by William is ${total_spent}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code should give us the result of how much William spent in total. Let's verify and present the solution.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Verify the calculations for each type of item:\n   - Notebooks: 50 * $15.00 = $750.00\n   - Ballpens: 10 * $5.00 = $50.00\n2. Add these two amounts: $750.00 + $50.00 = $800.00\n\nOnce verified, the total amount William spent is \\(\\boxed{800}\\)."
