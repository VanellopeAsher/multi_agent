Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total angular displacement of the sun from its starting point after the given time intervals. The problem states that the sun moves at different rates over different periods. Let's break down the computation step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Initial Position:**\n    - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which sits at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground relative to Sahir's house.\n\n2. **First Movement:**\n    - The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours.\n    - Total movement for this period: \\(5 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 50 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\n3. **Second Movement:**\n    - After the first 10 hours, the sun continues to move at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for another 2 hours.\n    - Total movement for this period: \\(3 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\n4. **Total Displacement:**\n    - Combine the initial angle with the two movement periods to find the total angle from the ground.\n    - Total angle = Initial angle + First Movement + Second Movement\n    - Total angle = \\(32 \\text{ degrees} + 50 \\text{ degrees} + 6 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate it using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculating total displacement angle\ninitial_angle = 32  # degrees\nfirst_movement = 5 * 10  # 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours\nsecond_movement = 3 * 2  # 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours\n\n# Total angle from the ground\ntotal_angle = initial_angle + first_movement + second_movement\n\n# Print the result in degrees\nprint(total_angle)\n```\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- Initial angle = 32 degrees\n- First movement = 50 degrees\n- Second movement = 6 degrees\n- Total angle = \\(32 + 50 + 6 = 88\\) degrees\n\nThe final angle from the ground to the sun is 88 degrees.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- Ensure each step's calculations align with provided rates and durations.\n- Recalculate individual steps if needed, confirming mathematical steps.\n- Confirm logical sequence: initial angle + the sum of movements match expectations.\n\n\\(\\boxed{88}\\) is the angle in degrees from the ground to the sun after the specified movements."
