Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's denote the number of bandages used on the first day as \\( x \\).\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Determine the Initial and Total Bandages:**\n   - Start with 19 bandages.\n   - On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack (50 bandages), so now they have \\( 19 + 50 = 69 \\) bandages.\n\n2. **Track Usage Across Days:**\n   - On the first day, they used \\( x \\) bandages.\n   - On the second day, they used \\( x - 10 \\) bandages.\n   - On the third day, they ordered two more bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and used half a pack (25 bandages).\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Bandages:**\n   - They end with 78 bandages at the end of the third day.\n\n**Equation:**\n\nThe equation that represents the scenario is:\n\\[\n69 - x - (x - 10) + 100 - 25 = 78\n\\]\n\n**Simplify and Solve the Equation:**\n\nLet's solve this equation step by step using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Setup the equation based on the information provided\nequation = Eq(69 - x - (x - 10) + 100 - 25, 78)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Start with 19 bandages and receive 1 bulk pack of 50, totaling 69 bandages.\n2. Use \\( x \\) on the first day.\n3. Use \\( x - 10 \\) on the second day.\n4. Order two additional bulk packs (100 bandages) and use 25 on the third day.\n\nPlug these into the equation: \n\\[ 69 - x - (x - 10) + 100 - 25 = 78 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\) to verify:\n- The left side minus bandage used equals 78:\n\\[ 69 + 100 - 25 - (x + x - 10) = 78 \\]\n\\[ 169 - 25 - 2x + 10 = 78 \\]\n\\[ 154 - 2x = 78 \\]\n\\[ 76 = 2x \\]\n\\[ x = 38 \\]\n\nAfter re-examining each step for errors:\n\nFinal verification is consistent; our solution is correct.\n\nThe number of bandages used on the first day is \\(\\boxed{38}\\)."
