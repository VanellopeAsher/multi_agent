Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first break it down into manageable steps.\n\n### Key Concept:\nWe need to determine the total time in hours it will take for a group of five individuals to paint an entire house, given the painting capability of one individual.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Determine the rate at which one individual paints:**\n   - An individual can paint half a house in 5 days.\n   - Therefore, the rate of painting for one individual is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rate of one individual} = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{house}}{10 \\, \\text{days}}\n     \\]\n   - This means 1 individual can paint \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of a house per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the combined rate for 5 individuals:**\n   - If 1 individual can paint \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of a house per day, then 5 individuals can paint:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rate of 5 individuals} = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{house per day}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many days it takes for 5 individuals to paint the entire house:**\n   - Since the team of 5 paints \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a house per day, it will take them:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Days to paint a whole house} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \\, \\text{days}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert days to hours:**\n   - There are 24 hours in a day. Therefore, the number of hours it takes for the 5 individuals to paint the house is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 24 = 48 \\, \\text{hours}\n     \\]\n\nSo, the team of 5 individuals will take 48 hours to paint an entire house.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n- Each of the steps follows logically from the assumptions and calculations shown.\n- The total time in days was converted into hours correctly.\n\nThus, the final verified number of hours it will take is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]"
