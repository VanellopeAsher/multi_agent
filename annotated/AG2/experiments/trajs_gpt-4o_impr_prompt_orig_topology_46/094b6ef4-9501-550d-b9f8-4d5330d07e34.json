Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. If the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length, how long is the shark?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the shark given the information about the remoras.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nThe combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. We know each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras attached to the shark.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n1. Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.\n2. Since this combined length represents 10% of the shark's total length, set up an equation to find the shark's length.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations using sympy for symbolic computation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the length of one remora\nremora_length = 6  # inches\n\n# Total length of the remoras\ntotal_remora_length = 2 * remora_length\n\n# Define the variable for the shark's length\nshark_length = symbols('shark_length')\n\n# Equation: 10% of the shark's length is equal to the total remora length\nequation = Eq(0.10 * shark_length, total_remora_length)\n\n# Solve the equation for the shark's length\nshark_length_value = solve(equation, shark_length)[0]\n\n# Print the shark's length\nprint(shark_length_value)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- We first calculate the total length of the remoras by multiplying the length of one remora (6 inches) by 2.\n- We then set up the equation \\(0.10 \\times \\text{shark_length} = \\text{total_remora_length}\\).\n- Using sympy, we solve this equation for the shark's length.\n- Finally, we print the shark's length.\n\n**Verification:**\n- **Step 1:** Calculate the total remora length: \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) inches.\n- **Step 2:** Set up equation: \\(0.10 \\times \\text{shark_length} = 12\\).\n- **Step 3:** Solve for shark_length: \\(\\text{shark_length} = \\frac{12}{0.10} = 120\\) inches.\n\nSince the equation is correctly set up and solved, the calculation seems accurate.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe length of the shark is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) inches."
