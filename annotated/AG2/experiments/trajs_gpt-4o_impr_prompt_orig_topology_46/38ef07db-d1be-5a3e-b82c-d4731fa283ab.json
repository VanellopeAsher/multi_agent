      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20.5 feet on the long side and 15.5 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?"

      "content": "To determine the total length of crepe-paper streamers James needs to purchase, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. Perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\]\n\nwhere the Length is 20.5 feet and the Width is 15.5 feet. \n\nLet's use Python to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Length and width of the rectangle\nlength = 20.5\nwidth = 15.5\n\n# Calculate the perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result in fractions or whole numbers\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nperimeter_exact = Rational(perimeter).limit_denominator()\nprint(f\"The total length of crepe paper needed is {perimeter_exact} feet.\")\n```\n\nThe code above calculates the perimeter using Python and displays the result in a fractional or exact form using the sympy library. Now, let's verify the correctness of our computations:\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Calculate the sum of the length and width:\n   \\[ 20.5 + 15.5 = 36 \\]\n2. Multiply by 2 (since it's a rectangle and we need both pairs of sides):\n   \\[ 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\]\n\nThus, the perimeter, which is the total length of crepe-paper James needs, is 72 feet.\n\n\\(\\boxed{72}\\)"
