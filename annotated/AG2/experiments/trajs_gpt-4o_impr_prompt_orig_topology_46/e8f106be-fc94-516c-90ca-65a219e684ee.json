Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is planning a birthday party and wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how much crepe-paper James needs to buy for his fence, we will calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The crepe-paper will be hung around the fence itself, not on the tree. The tree standing in the middle of the yard does not affect this calculation.\n\n**Key Idea/Concept**:\nThe problem revolves around finding the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\]\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the dimensions of the rectangular fence:\n   - Length = 20 feet\n   - Width = 15 feet\n\n2. Use the formula to calculate the perimeter.\n\n3. The tree's presence is irrelevant in this context since the question asks about the perimeter of the fence.\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python for accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Dimensions of the fence\nlength = 20  # feet\nwidth = 15   # feet\n\n# Calculate the perimeter of the fence\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nNow let's verify this step-by-step:\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n- Check if the formula used is correct for finding the perimeter of a rectangle.\n- Ensure correct substitution of the given dimensions:\n  - Length = 20\n  - Width = 15\n- Calculate:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70\n  \\]\n- Confirm that the calculation follows logical mathematical operations.\n\nThe calculation and logic are correct. The perimeter of the rectangle, and thus the amount of crepe paper needed, is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{70}\\] \n\n(Note: This value is correctly enclosed in a box and contains only a number, as per the specified format.)"
