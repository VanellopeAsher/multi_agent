Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much total money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes and how much more she needs to earn by mowing lawns. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Cost\nThe items Sara wants to buy include:\n- One jacket costing $120\n- Two pairs of shoes, each costing $100\n\nThe total cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 120 + (2 \\times 100) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine Sara's Total Savings\nSara initially has $100 saved. She earns additional money from:\n- Babysitting: $5 per session, and she babysits 10 times.\n- Mowing the lawn: $10 per time, which is what we need to calculate.\n\nFirst, calculate the amount earned from babysitting:\n\\[ \\text{Babysitting Earnings} = 5 \\times 10 \\]\n\nNow, find her total savings from babysitting and her initial saved amount:\n\\[ \\text{Total Initial Savings} = 100 + \\text{Babysitting Earnings} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Deficit\nSubtract her total initial savings from the total cost to find how much more she needs:\n\\[ \\text{Deficit} = \\text{Total Cost} - \\text{Total Initial Savings} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Times to Mow the Lawn\nSara earns $10 each time she mows the lawn, so divide the deficit by $10 to find how many times she must mow the lawn:\n\\[ \\text{Times to Mow} = \\frac{\\text{Deficit}}{10} \\]\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\n# Known data\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost_per_pair = 100\nnumber_of_shoes = 2\nbabysitting_sessions = 10\nbabysitting_earning_per_session = 5\ninitial_savings = 100\nlawn_mowing_earning_per_time = 10\n\n# Compute total cost of the jacket and shoes\ntotal_cost = jacket_cost + (shoe_cost_per_pair * number_of_shoes)\n\n# Compute total earnings from babysitting\nbabysitting_earnings = babysitting_earning_per_session * babysitting_sessions\n\n# Total initial savings including money before babysitting\ntotal_initial_savings = initial_savings + babysitting_earnings\n\n# Compute the deficit\ndeficit = total_cost - total_initial_savings\n\n# Variable for the number of times to mow the lawn\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for earnings needed from mowing the lawn\nequation = Eq(deficit, lawn_mowing_earning_per_time * x)\n\n# Solve for x\ntimes_to_mow = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Times to mow the lawn: {times_to_mow}\")\n```\n\nThe calculation performed above gives us how many times Sara must mow the lawn. Let me compute the result for you:\n\n```plaintext\n# Calculating:\n# Total cost for jacket and shoes: 120 + (2 * 100) = 320\n# Babysitting earnings: 5 * 10 = 50\n# Total initial savings: 100 + 50 = 150\n# Deficit: 320 - 150 = 170\n# Times to mow: 170 / 10 = 17\n```\n\nSo, Sara must mow the lawn \\(\\boxed{17}\\) times to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. Calculations for cost and savings have been rechecked by following the outlined steps.\n2. All intermediate values for babysitting earnings, total savings, and deficit have been verified.\n3. Dividing the deficit by the earnings per mowing session to find the number of times she needs to mow is consistent with the calculations.\n\nThe final answer of \\(\\boxed{17}\\) times is confirmed correct."
