      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Crayon Pieces**: Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, and there are 64 crayons in each box, making the total number of crayons \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Muffins**: Kate makes a muffin by melting 8 crayon pieces together. Therefore, the number of muffins she can make is \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Sale Price of Each Muffin**: Kate sold all her muffin crayons for $36. To find out how much each crayon muffin sells for, we divide the total earnings by the number of muffins she made.

Let's ensure the solution is clear using a fresh explanation and method.\n\n### Problem Recap and Solution Steps\n\n1. Kate has **192 crayons** (because she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons: \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\)).\n2. She makes crayon muffins by melting 8 crayons together. This means she can make \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\) muffins.\n3. She sells all these muffins for $36 in total.\n\nWe need to find out how much each muffin sells for. The total sale amount of $36 needs to be divided by 24 muffins:\n\n\\[ \\text{Price per muffin} = \\frac{36}{24} \\]\n\n### Simplifying the Fraction\n\nDivide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12:\n\n\\[ \\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{36 \\div 12}{24 \\div 12} = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nThe answer is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), which in decimal form is 1.5, meaning each muffin sells for $1.50. Since you requested the fraction, we emphasize \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nLet’s represent this step-by-step succinctly in Python using a symbolic approach:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate price per muffin as a rational number\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(36, 24)\n\n# Output the result as a fraction\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\n\n### Answer Verification\n\n1. **Total crayons**: \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\).\n2. **Number of muffins**: \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\).\n3. **Verify fraction calculation**: Simplify \\(\\frac{36}{24}\\) to \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\). \n\nThe answer remains:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\\)\n\nIf there's a misunderstanding or if I can assist with something else, please guide me further!"

In decimal form, this is $1.50.\n\n### Different Approach - Linear Method\n\nLet's break it down into very simple arithmetic operations:\n\n1. Multiply to find total crayons.\n2. Divide the number of crayons by the muffins needed to find how many muffins she can make.\n3.
