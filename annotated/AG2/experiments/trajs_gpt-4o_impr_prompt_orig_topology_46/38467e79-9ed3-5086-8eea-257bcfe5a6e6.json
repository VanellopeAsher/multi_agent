Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home. If 30 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students at the grade level, given that two-thirds of them have desktop computers at home, and 30 students do not have desktop computers.\n\nHere’s how we can approach this problem:\n\n**Key Concept**: We can express the relationships using algebra. If \\( x \\) is the total number of students, then \\(\\frac{2}{3}x\\) have desktop computers. Consequently, the remaining \\(\\frac{1}{3}x\\) do not have desktop computers. We know that \\(\\frac{1}{3}x = 30\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Setup the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3}x = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 30 \\times 3\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's use Python to compute this calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Setup the equation\nequation = Eq((1/3) * x, 30)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_students = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_students)\n```\n\n### Verification:\n\nLet's verify the solution step by step:\n\n1. We have established that \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of students do not have desktop computers, and this number equals 30.\n\n2. Solving \\(\\frac{1}{3}x = 30\\) gives us \\(x = 90\\).\n\n3. Double-check this result:\n   - If the total number of students is 90, then \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 90 = 30\\) students do not have desktop computers.\n   - Thus, \\(90 - 30 = 60\\) students have desktop computers, which is indeed \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 90\\).\n\nSince all verification steps are consistent, we can confidently state the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"
