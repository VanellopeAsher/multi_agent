Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total amount of vacation time he spent on various activities and then find what portion of that total is unaccounted for. Let's break down the problem using a structured approach.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Activities and Their Durations**:\n    - **Boating**: 6 hours\n    - **Swimming**: Half of the boating time, which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\) hours.\n    - **Shows**: 3 shows, each 2 hours long: \\( 3 \\times 2 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Total Time for Specified Activities**:\n    - Calculate the time spent swimming:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Swimming} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n      \\]\n    - Calculate the total time for watching shows:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Shows} = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Total Time Spent**:\n    - Total time on specified activities:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Total Specified Time} = 6 \\, (\\text{boating}) + 3 \\, (\\text{swimming}) + 6 \\, (\\text{shows}) = 15 \\text{ hours}\n      \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Total Vacation Time**:\n    - If 30% of his total vacation time was spent on the above activities, we can set up the equation:\n      \\[\n      0.3 \\times \\text{Total Vacation Time} = 15\n      \\]\n    - Solving for the total vacation time:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Total Vacation Time} = \\frac{15}{0.3} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n      \\]\n\n5. **Time Spent Sightseeing**:\n    - Subtract the time for the specified activities from the total vacation time:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Sightseeing Time} = 50 - 15 = 35 \\text{ hours}\n      \\]\n\n### Verification:\n\nLet's ensure the math is correct:\n\n- Calculating \\(0.3\\) of the total vacation time gives 15 hours.\n- Thus, if the total time is 50 hours, the above division confirms the correctness.\n- Subtracting 15 hours (spent on specified activities) from 50 hours (total) gives the remaining time for sightseeing.\n\nAfter verification:\n\n\\[ \n\\boxed{35} \n\\]\n\nThis is the time John spent sightseeing."
