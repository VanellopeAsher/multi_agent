      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips and decides to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips. If he can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row and he buys 30 yellow tulips, how many total rows of flowers will he plant?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of rows Jackson will plant using the given details. Let's go through this step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of rows of red tulips.**\n- Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in each row.\n- He has 36 red tulips.\n- Number of rows for red tulips = Total red tulips / Tulips per row = 36 / 6 = 6 rows.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips.**\n- Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.\n- He has 24 blue tulips.\n- Number of rows for blue tulips = Total blue tulips / Tulips per row = 24 / 8 = 3 rows.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of rows of yellow tulips.**\n- Jackson plans to add a row of yellow tulips between each row of red tulips and blue tulips.\n- Yellow tulips fit 5 per row, and he has 30 yellow tulips.\n- Number of rows for yellow tulips = Total yellow tulips / Tulips per row = 30 / 5 = 6 rows.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of rows.**\n- Jackson will plant all red tulip rows first, then a yellow tulip row in between each red and blue row, and finally all blue tulip rows.\n- There will be a yellow row after each red row and before each blue row.\n- Total rows = Rows of red tulips + Rows of blue tulips + Rows of yellow tulips = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 6 (yellow) = 15.\n\nNow let's verify everything step by step.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. Rows of red tulips: \\[ \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\] rows.\n2. Rows of blue tulips: \\[ \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\] rows.\n3. Rows of yellow tulips: \\[ \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\] rows.\n4. Total rows: \\( 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n# Calculations:\nred_rows = Rational(36, 6)\nblue_rows = Rational(24, 8)\nyellow_rows = Rational(30, 5)\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nThe calculation is consistent and correct based on the problem statement. Thus, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."
