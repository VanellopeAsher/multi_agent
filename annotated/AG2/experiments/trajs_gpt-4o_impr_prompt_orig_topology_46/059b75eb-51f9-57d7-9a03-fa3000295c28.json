Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain moment, a river is flowing with a volume of 4000 gallons of water. Following a day of intense rainfall, the water volume at the same location in the river becomes twice as much. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow at that point. What is the total volume of water flowing through that point of the river on the third day?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's follow a Case 1: Direct Python Solution approach. We can calculate in steps how the water volume changes over the days.\n\nHere's how to approach it:\n\n1. **Day 1:** The river contains 4000 gallons of water.\n2. **Day 2:** After the rainfall, the volume doubles.\n3. **Day 3:** An additional 6000 gallons are added.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the total water volume at the end of the third day.\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial volume of water in the river\ninitial_volume = Rational(4000)\n\n# Day 2: Volume doubles\nvolume_day_2 = 2 * initial_volume\n\n# Day 3: 6000 gallons added\nvolume_day_3 = volume_day_2 + Rational(6000)\n\n# Output the total volume on the third day\nprint(volume_day_3)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Initial Volume (Day 1):** 4000 gallons\n2. **Volume after Day 2:** \\( 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\) gallons\n3. **Volume after Day 3:** \\( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \\) gallons\n\nAll calculations match the expected results. Therefore, the solution logic is correct.\n\nThe total volume of water on the third day is \\(\\boxed{14000}\\) gallons."
