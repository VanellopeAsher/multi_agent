Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden. He can accommodate 6 red tulips per row and 8 blue tulips per row. If Jackson purchases 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of tulips will he end up planting?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rows Jackson will plant for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately. We know:\n\n1. Jackson can plant 6 red tulips per row.\n2. He has 36 red tulips in total.\n3. Jackson can plant 8 blue tulips per row.\n4. He has 24 blue tulips in total.\n\nLet's calculate the number of rows for each type of tulip:\n\nFor the red tulips:\n\\[ \\text{Number of rows for red tulips} = \\frac{36}{6} \\]\n\nFor the blue tulips:\n\\[ \\text{Number of rows for blue tulips} = \\frac{24}{8} \\]\n\nWe can use Python and its `sympy` library to conduct these calculations efficiently. Let's do that:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the number of rows for red tulips\nred_rows = Rational(36, 6)\n\n# Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips\nblue_rows = Rational(24, 8)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Number of rows for red tulips: {red_rows}\")\nprint(f\"Number of rows for blue tulips: {blue_rows}\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Check the red tulips calculation:**\n   \\[ \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\] rows. This is correct as dividing 36 by 6 results in 6.\n\n2. **Check the blue tulips calculation:**\n   \\[ \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\] rows. This is correct as dividing 24 by 8 results in 3.\n\nSince both calculations are verified, our conclusion is:\n\nJackson will plant \\( \\boxed{6} \\) rows of red tulips and \\( \\boxed{3} \\) rows of blue tulips."

Jackson can plant 6 red tulips per row. With 36 red tulips, the calculation for the number of rows is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rows for red tulips} = \\frac{36}{6} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2.

Since the task was to determine how many rows Jackson will plant, there's no further calculation needed beyond this point.\n\nThe final result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6 \\text{ red tulip rows, } 3 \\text{ blue tulip rows}}\n\\] \n\nIf there are any further questions or different angles you'd like to explore regarding this problem, feel free to let me know!"
