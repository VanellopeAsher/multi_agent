Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOf the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic.

      "content": "To determine the percentage of remaining available cars that are semi-automatic, we will follow a structured approach, calculating the number of each type of car that is available after considering those rented out or under maintenance.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Find the Initial Numbers:**\n   - Automatic cars: 12\n   - Manual cars: 4\n   - Total cars: 20\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Semi-Automatic Cars:**\n   - Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars\n   - Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4\n\n3. **Determine the Cars Unavailable for Rent:**\n   - Rented out automatic cars = 3\n   - Manual cars under maintenance = 2\n\n4. **Calculate Available Cars:**\n   - Available automatic cars = 12 - 3 = 9\n   - Available manual cars = 4 - 2 = 2\n   - All semi-automatic cars are available, so semi-automatic cars = 4\n\n5. **Total Available Cars:**\n   - Total available cars = Available automatic cars + Available manual cars + Semi-automatic cars\n   - Total available cars = 9 + 2 + 4 = 15\n\n6. **Find the Percentage of Remaining Cars that are Semi-Automatic:**\n   - Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total available cars) × 100\n   - Percentage = (4 / 15) × 100\n\nNow, let's use Python (with sympy for handling fractions) to calculate the exact percentage:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the percentage\nsemi_automatic_cars = 4\ntotal_available_cars = 15\npercentage_semi_automatic = Rational(semi_automatic_cars, total_available_cars) * 100\n\n# Print the result\nprint(percentage_semi_automatic)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Rechecking Calculations:**\n   - Total cars initially: 20\n   - Sum of automatic and manual cars = 12 + 4 = 16\n   - Confirm semi-automatic cars: 20 - 16 = 4\n\n2. **Availability Calculations:**\n   - Automatic: 12 - 3 = 9\n   - Manual: 4 - 2 = 2\n   - Semi-automatic: 4 (all available)\n\n3. **Total Available Check:**\n   - 9 + 2 + 4 = 15 (Confirmed)\n\n4. **Percentage Calculation:**\n   - Proper calculations are checked using sympy.\n\nFinal Calculation:\n- \\( \\frac{4}{15} \\times 100 = \\frac{400}{15} = 26.\\overline{6} \\%\\)\n\nThus, the percentage of the remaining available cars that are semi-automatic is \\(\\boxed{26\\frac{2}{3}}\\)."
