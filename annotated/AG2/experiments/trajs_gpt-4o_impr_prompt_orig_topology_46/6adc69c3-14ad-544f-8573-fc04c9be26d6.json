Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. Each final is cut into 5 cm. How long is the ribbon?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's use a step-by-step process to determine the length of the ribbon Marty has.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Pieces:**\n   Marty cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts in the first cut. Each of these 4 parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. Therefore, he has a total of \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) pieces after all cuts.\n\n2. **Identify the Length of Each Final Piece:**\n   We know that each of the final pieces is 5 cm long.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Ribbon Length:**\n   If there are 20 final pieces, each 5 cm long, the total length of the ribbon is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Length} = 20 \\times 5 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\nLet's perform this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of final pieces and length of each piece\nnum_final_pieces = 20\nlength_each_piece = 5  # cm\n\n# Calculate total length of the ribbon\ntotal_ribbon_length = num_final_pieces * length_each_piece\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_ribbon_length)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Check the Number of Cuts:**\n   We verified that the ribbon is divided into a total of 20 pieces.\n\n2. **Check the Length of Each Final Piece:**\n   Each piece is confirmed to be 5 cm.\n\n3. **Check the Total Ribbon Length Calculation:**\n   The multiplication of 20 pieces by 5 cm gives the total length.\n\nAfter verifying each part of our approach, we find the total length of the ribbon to be:\n\\[ \\text{Total Length} = 100 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer will be presented as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]"
