Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten. If the mean score is 70, what's the forgortten score?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the forgotten score when given the mean score of Sally's quizzes.\n\n**Key Idea:** We know the formula for the mean (average) of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the total number of numbers. We can use this to express the unknown score in terms of the known scores and the given mean.\n\nLet's use the direct calculation approach to solve this problem with Python.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. Calculate the sum of the known scores.\n2. Let the forgotten score be \\( x \\).\n3. Use the formula for the mean to set up an equation and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nHere's the structured approach in code:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary library\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve\n\n# Known scores\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# Let the forgotten score be x\nx = Symbol('x')\n\n# Calculate the sum of known scores\nsum_known_scores = sum(scores)\n\n# Total number of scores including the forgotten one\ntotal_scores_count = len(scores) + 1\n\n# Given mean\nmean_score = 70\n\n# Set up the equation for the mean\nequation = Eq((sum_known_scores + x) / total_scores_count, mean_score)\n\n# Solve for x\nforgotten_score = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the forgotten score\nprint(forgotten_score)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Calculate the sum of known scores:**\n\n   \\( 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570 \\)\n\n2. **Set up the equation using the mean formula:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{570 + x}{9} = 70\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   570 + x = 630 \\implies x = 630 - 570 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification of the solution:**\n\n   Adding 60 to the sum of the scores gives 630. Dividing by 9 gives the mean:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{630}{9} = 70\n   \\]\n\nSince our calculation confirms the given mean, the solution is verified.\n\nThe forgotten score is \\(\\boxed{60}\\)."
