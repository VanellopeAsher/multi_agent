Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges.

She keeps a fraction of the remaining boxes for herself and sells the rest. Our goal is to calculate the number of oranges she sold.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the Initial Total Number of Oranges**: \n    - Mrs. Harrington bought a dozen boxes, each box containing 20 oranges.\n    - Total oranges = number of boxes × oranges per box = \\( 12 \\times 20 \\).\n\n2. **Allocate Boxes to Family Members**: \n    - She gives 2 boxes to her mother and 2 boxes to her sibling.\n    - Total boxes given away = 2 (mother) + 2 (sibling) = 4 boxes.\n    - Remaining boxes = total boxes purchased - boxes given away = \\( 12 - 4 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate and Distribute Remaining Oranges**:\n    - Remaining oranges = remaining boxes × oranges per box.\n    - Mrs. Harrington keeps one-quarter of the remaining oranges for herself and sells the rest.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Oranges Sold**:\n    - Oranges she keeps = \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of remaining oranges.\n    - Oranges sold = remaining oranges - oranges she keeps.\n\nLet's calculate these numerically using Python.\n\n```python\n# Python code to solve the problem\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial total oranges\ntotal_boxes = 12\noranges_per_box = 20\ntotal_oranges = total_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Boxes given away to mother and sibling\nboxes_given_away = 2 + 2\nremaining_boxes = total_boxes - boxes_given_away\nremaining_oranges = remaining_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Oranges kept by Mrs. Harrington\noranges_kept = Rational(1, 4) * remaining_oranges\n\n# Oranges sold\noranges_sold = remaining_oranges - oranges_kept\n\n# Print the result\nprint(oranges_sold)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify each step to ensure the solution is accurate:\n\n1. **Initial oranges calculation**:\n   - \\(12 \\times 20 = 240\\) oranges.\n\n2. **After distributing boxes**:\n   - Given away boxes: 4.\n   - Remaining boxes: \\(12 - 4 = 8\\).\n   - Remaining oranges: \\(8 \\times 20 = 160\\).\n\n3. **Oranges kept by Mrs. Harrington**:\n   - Quarter of remaining oranges: \\(\\frac{160}{4} = 40\\) oranges.\n\n4. **Oranges sold**:\n   - Oranges sold = Remaining oranges - Oranges kept \\(= 160 - 40 = 120\\).\n\nThe calculation through the code accurately reflects these steps, leading us to conclude that the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
