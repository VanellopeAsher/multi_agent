Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing given the service time, cost of labor, and parts used. We'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the fixed service fee and the hourly labor rate.\n2. Calculate the labor cost for the given hours, noting that hours are charged for each fraction of an hour.\n3. Add the costs of parts and the fixed service fee to the labor cost to find the total bill.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\n1. **Fixed Service Fee:** $40\n2. **Hourly Labor Rate:** $35 per hour or fraction of an hour\n3. **Total Hours Worked:** 2.25 hours\n4. **Cost of Parts:** $60\n\n### Calculations\n\n- **Service Fee:** $40\n\n- **Cost of Parts:** $60\n\n- **Labor Cost:**\n  Since the labor is charged per hour or fraction thereof, we need to round 2.25 hours up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the labor will be charged for 3 hours.\n\n  Labor cost = 3 (hours) Ã— $35 (per hour) = $105\n\n- **Total Cost:** We sum the service fee, labor cost, and cost of parts.\n\n  Total = $40 (service fee) + $105 (labor cost) + $60 (cost of parts) = $205\n\n### Python Code to Compute the Total Bill\n\n```python\n# Given values\nservice_fee = 40  # Fixed service fee in dollars\nlabor_rate = 35   # Labor rate per hour in dollars\nparts_cost = 60   # Cost of parts in dollars\nhours_worked = 2.25  # Hours of work\n\n# Calculate labor cost by rounding up to the nearest whole number\nimport math\nlabor_hours_billed = math.ceil(hours_worked)\nlabor_cost = labor_hours_billed * labor_rate\n\n# Calculate the total bill\ntotal_bill = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_bill)\n```\n\nLet's perform the calculations in Python to confirm:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nI have calculated each component of the bill:\n\n- Verified the fixed service fee is correctly added: $40\n- Computed labor cost for rounded-up hours: $105 (for 3 hours)\n- Added the parts cost correctly: $60\n\nI verified that each part is correctly factored into the total calculation. Since all steps follow the requirements and calculations align, the final answer is accurate.\n\nThus, the total amount billed by Patty is \\(\\boxed{205}\\)."
