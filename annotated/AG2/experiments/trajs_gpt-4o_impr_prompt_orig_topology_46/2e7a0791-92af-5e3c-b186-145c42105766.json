Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow a straightforward calculation approach using Python. We'll calculate the total steps that Elliott has already completed, then determine how many he has left, and finally find out how many additional steps he took during his jog.\n\nLet's solve this with Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the steps before and after the jog\ntotal_steps_goal = 10000\nhalf_steps = total_steps_goal // 2\nsteps_friend_walk = 1000\nsteps_shopping = 500\nsteps_left = 2000\n\n# Calculate the steps taken before the jog\nsteps_before_jog = half_steps + steps_friend_walk + steps_shopping\n\n# Calculate the steps taken during the jog\nsteps_during_jog = total_steps_goal - steps_before_jog - steps_left\n\n# Output the number of steps taken during the jog\nfrom sympy import pprint\npprint(steps_during_jog, use_unicode=True)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total number of steps Elliott completed before going on his jog, which includes steps from walking to/from school, walking with a friend, and shopping. Then it calculates how many steps are left after the jog, and subtracts to find out how many steps were taken during the jog.\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n1. Elliott completed:\n   - Half of his steps: \\( \\frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \\) steps.\n   - Steps with a friend: 1,000 steps.\n   - Steps shopping: 500 steps.\n\n2. Total steps before jogging:\n   \\[\n   5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500\n   \\]\n\n3. Steps left after jogging: 2,000 steps.\n\n4. Total steps required: 10,000 steps.\n\n5. Steps during the jog:\n   \\[\n   10,000 - 6,500 - 2,000 = 1,500 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\nThe number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \\(\\boxed{1500}\\)."
