Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

Our objective is to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.\n\nFirst, let's define the problem:\n\n1. Emil is currently 21 years old.\n2. In 5 years, Emil will be 26 years old.\n3. When Emil is 26, he will be half the age of his dad.  \n   This gives us the equation:  \n   \\[ \\text{Dad's age in 5 years} = 2 \\times \\text{Emil's age in 5 years} = 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\]\n\n4. When Emil is 26, he will be twice the age of his brother.  \n   This gives us the equation:  \n   \\[ \\text{Brother's age in 5 years} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Emil's age in 5 years} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 26 = 13 \\]\n\nWe can set up equations to represent these conditions in terms of their current ages.\n\nLet \\( d \\) and \\( b \\) be the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, respectively.\n\nThe equations are:\n- \\( d + 5 = 52 \\)\n- \\( b + 5 = 13 \\)\n\nNow let's solve these equations using Python and compute the sum of their current ages.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define symbols\nd, b = symbols('d b')\n\n# Set up the equations based on the information\nequation1 = Eq(d + 5, 52)\nequation2 = Eq(b + 5, 13)\n\n# Solve the equations\ndad_age_now = solve(equation1, d)[0]\nbrother_age_now = solve(equation2, b)[0]\n\n# Calculate the sum of current ages of dad and brother\nsum_of_ages = dad_age_now + brother_age_now\n\n# Print result\nprint(sum_of_ages)\n```\n\nThis code will output the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1. We solve equation \\( d + 5 = 52 \\) to find \\( d \\).\n2. We solve equation \\( b + 5 = 13 \\) to find \\( b \\).\n3. We sum these results to get the final answer.\n\nLet's validate this solution with a VERIFICATION section:\n\n- \\(\\text{Dad's current age} = d = 52 - 5 = 47\\).\n- \\(\\text{Brother's current age} = b = 13 - 5 = 8\\).\n- The sum of these ages should be \\( 47 + 8 = 55 \\).\n\nThe calculations are correct. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{55}\n\\]"
