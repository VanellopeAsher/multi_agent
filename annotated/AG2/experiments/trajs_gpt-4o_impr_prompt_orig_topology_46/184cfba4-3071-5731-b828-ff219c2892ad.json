Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll take a systematic approach. Since we know the price of the small stuffed animals and the relationship between the small and large stuffed animals in terms of quantity and price, we can set up equations to solve for the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Equations**\n1. We know the price of each small stuffed animal is $40. Therefore, Teresa earned \\( 40x \\) dollars from the small stuffed animals.\n2. Large stuffed animals are three times the price of small ones, so each costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) dollars. Therefore, the revenue from large stuffed animals is \\( 120y \\).\n3. We know from the problem statement that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\( x = 2y \\).\n4. The total revenue from sales is $1200, which gives us the equation: \n   \\[\n   40x + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Equations**\nSubstituting \\( x = 2y \\) into the revenue equation:\n\n\\[\n40(2y) + 120y = 1200\n\\]\n\\[\n80y + 120y = 1200\n\\]\n\\[\n200y = 1200\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x = 2y \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, Teresa sold \\( 12 \\) small stuffed animals.\n\n**Verification**\n- If \\( x = 12 \\), then Teresa earned \\( 40 \\times 12 = 480 \\) dollars from small stuffed animals.\n- Since \\( y = 6 \\), she earned \\( 120 \\times 6 = 720 \\) dollars from large stuffed animals.\n- Total revenue: \\( 480 + 720 = 1200 \\) dollars, which matches the total given in the problem statement.\n\nThe solution is correct.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
