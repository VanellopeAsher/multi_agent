Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents, how many cents will she have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the total value of Kelly's quarters and dimes, the cost of her purchases, and finally determine how much money she will have left.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Value of Quarters and Dimes:**\n   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents.\n   - Each dime is worth 10 cents.\n   - Calculate the total value of 5 quarters.\n   - Calculate the total value of 2 dimes.\n   - Add these two totals to get the overall initial amount Kelly has.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost of Purchases:**\n   - The can of pop costs 55 cents.\n   - The candy bar costs 45 cents.\n   - Add these two amounts to get the total expenditure.\n\n3. **Determine the Remaining Amount:**\n   - Subtract the total cost of purchases from Kelly's initial amount to find out how much she will have left.\n\n### Calculation Using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate total value of quarters and dimes\nquarters_value = 5 * 25  # 5 quarters, each worth 25 cents\ndimes_value = 2 * 10    # 2 dimes, each worth 10 cents\n\n# Initial total amount\ninitial_total = quarters_value + dimes_value\n\n# Calculate total cost of purchases\ncost_of_pop = 55  # 55 cents\ncost_of_candy_bar = 45  # 45 cents\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_of_pop + cost_of_candy_bar\n\n# Remaining amount after purchases\nremaining_amount = initial_total - total_cost\n\n# Print the result in cents\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Value of Quarters:**\n   - \\(5 \\times 25 = 125\\) cents.\n\n2. **Value of Dimes:**\n   - \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) cents.\n\n3. **Initial Total:**\n   - \\(125 + 20 = 145\\) cents.\n\n4. **Total Expenditure:**\n   - \\(55 + 45 = 100\\) cents.\n\n5. **Remaining Amount:**\n   - \\(145 - 100 = 45\\) cents.\n\nAfter verifying each step, we conclude that the remaining amount Kelly will have is \\( \\boxed{45} \\) cents."
