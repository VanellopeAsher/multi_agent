      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's follow a structured approach:\n\n**Key Idea**: Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has, find how many cards she gives to her students, and then determine how many students there are based on the number of cards each student receives.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process**:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards.\n3. Find the total number of all cards by adding the basketball cards, baseball cards, and the special collection of soccer cards.\n4. Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps for herself to determine the number of cards given to the students.\n5. Calculate the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library to handle fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate total basketball cards\nbasketball_decks = 6\nbasketball_cards_per_deck = 25\ntotal_basketball_cards = basketball_decks * basketball_cards_per_deck\n\n# Calculate total baseball cards\nbaseball_boxes = 5\nbaseball_cards_per_box = 40\ntotal_baseball_cards = baseball_boxes * baseball_cards_per_box\n\n# Calculate total cards\nspecial_soccer_cards = 30\n\n# Total number of cards\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards + special_soccer_cards\n\n# Cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Each student receives 10 cards\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Calculate number of students\nnumber_of_students = cards_given_to_students / cards_per_student\n\n# Print the result, using Rational to ensure we get a fraction if needed (though we expect whole number)\nprint(Rational(number_of_students))\n```\n\nLet's perform a calculation:\n\n- Total basketball cards: \\( 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\)\n- Total baseball cards: \\( 5 \\times 40 = 200 \\)\n- Total cards: \\( 150 + 200 + 30 = 380 \\)\n- Cards given to students: \\( 380 - 50 = 330 \\)\n- Number of students: \\( \\frac{330}{10} = 33 \\)\n\n**Verification**: \n\n1. Individually calculate the contribution of each sport to ensure accuracy.\n2. Verify the total card count and confirm the subtraction step.\n3. Confirm that dividing by the number of cards per student yields an integer value, as expected for the number of students.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\] \n\nMiss Maria has 33 students."
