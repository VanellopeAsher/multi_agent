Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was several inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to use some basic arithmetic, given the growth pattern described. Let's tackle this step-by-step:\n\n1. Define the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week.\n2. Understand how it changes over the subsequent weeks.\n3. Calculate the height after the second week, and then the third week.\n\nLet's assume the height of the beanstalk after the first week is \\( h \\) inches.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initial height after the first week:** \\( h \\)\n2. **Height after the second week:** It doubled in height, so it became \\( 2h \\).\n3. **Height after the third week:** Grew another 4 inches, so it became \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nSince we don't have the initial height \\( h \\) mentioned explicitly, the height after 3 weeks can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 2h + 4 \\]\n\nCurrently, we don't have any numerical data to substitute for \\( h \\). This indicates the problem is unsolvable with the data provided, as we can't calculate a specific numerical answer.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the lack of numerical data for \\( h \\), we don't have enough information to solve for a specific height value. According to the instructions for handling missing data:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\] \n\nThis indicates that the solution requires additional data to produce a numerical result."
