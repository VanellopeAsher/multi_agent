Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we'll follow a step-by-step process, calculating the total expenditure Pauline incurs over the years she visits the museum.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Cost Calculation**:\n   - Cost per visit initially is $10.\n   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.\n\n2. **Calculate Expenses for the First 10 Years**:\n   - For the first 10 years, the cost per visit remains constant at $10.\n   - Total number of visits in 10 years = 10 years * 3 visits/year = 30 visits.\n   - Total cost for these 10 years = 30 visits * $10/visit.\n\n3. **Increasing Cost Calculation**:\n   - After 10 years, the cost increases by 150%.\n   - New cost per visit = $10 + (150% of $10).\n   - 150% of $10 = \\(\\frac{150}{100} \\times 10 = 15\\).\n   - New cost per visit = $10 + $15 = $25.\n\n4. **Calculate Expenses for the Next 3 Years**:\n   - For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $25.\n   - Total number of visits in these 3 years = 3 years * 3 visits/year = 9 visits.\n   - Total cost for these 3 years = 9 visits * $25/visit.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Expenses**:\n   - Combine the costs from the first 10 years and the next 3 years.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python using the `print` function for clear calculation output:\n\n```python\n# Initial cost per visit\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10\n\n# Visits in the first 10 years\nvisits_first_10_years = 10 * 3\n\n# Total cost for the first 10 years\ncost_first_10_years = visits_first_10_years * initial_cost_per_visit\n\n# Cost increase after 10 years is 150%, so the new cost is 2.5 times the original\nincreased_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit * 2.5\n\n# Visits in the next 3 years\nvisits_next_3_years = 3 * 3\n\n# Total cost for the next 3 years\ncost_next_3_years = visits_next_3_years * increased_cost_per_visit\n\n# Total cost for all visits\ntotal_cost = cost_first_10_years + cost_next_3_years\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(f\"Pauline's total expenditure on museum visits: ${total_cost}\")\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. For the first 10 years:\n   - 30 visits cost $10 each: \\(30 \\times 10 = 300\\).\n\n2. For the next 3 years (with a 150% increase):\n   - New cost per visit: $25 (checked calculation: \\(10 + 15 = 25\\)).\n   - 9 visits at $25 each: \\(9 \\times 25 = 225\\).\n\n3. Total cost: $300 (first 10 years) + $225 (next 3 years) = $525.\n\nThus, Pauline spends a total of $525 on all her museum visits. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{525}\\]"
