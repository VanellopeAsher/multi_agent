You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow the structured approach described.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach\n\n#### Key Idea\nWe need to find out how much time John spent sightseeing based on the given percentages and information about his activities. We know the total time spent on several activities and from this, we can infer the total time he spent on all activities. Using this information, we will then calculate the time spent on sightseeing.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the total time spent on known activities:**\n   - Boating: 6 hours\n   - Swimming: Half of boating time = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3 \\) hours\n   - Watching 3 shows which are 2 hours each: \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\n2. **Determine the total activity time using the percentage given:**\n   - The time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows represents 30% of the total time.\n\n3. **Calculate the total activity time from this percentage:**\n   - Let's denote the total activity time as \\( T \\).\n   - We know that 30% of \\( T \\) is the time spent on the above activities, so \\( 0.3 \\times T = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total activity time, \\( T \\), using the equation:**\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{15}{0.3}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of \\( T \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sightseeing time} = 0.4 \\times T\n   \\]\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations and get the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the symbol for total activity time\nT = symbols('T', positive=True, real=True)\n\n# Given equations based on problem statement\nactivity_time_equation = 0.3 * T - 15\n\n# Solve for T (total activity time)\ntotal_activity_time = solve(activity_time_equation, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate the sightseeing time (40% of total activity time)\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_activity_time\n\n# Print result in fraction form\nprint(\"The time spent sightseeing is:\", sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify calculations one by one:**\n   - Total time from the equation is calculated correctly from \\( 0.3 \\times T = 15 \\).\n   - Sightseeing is calculated correctly as 40% of the total \\( T \\).\n\n2. **Check values and ensure calculations adhere to original problem statement:** \n   - Each value derives logically from the steps and corresponds to described activities.\n\n3. **Double-check Python code correctness and output:**\n   - Ensure use of fractions and radical forms over decimals is enforced.\n\nBy following these steps, the solution given by the Python code should be verified and considered accurate."

Solved for the full activity time \\( T \\) using the equation \\( 0.3 \\times T = 15 \\), obtaining \\( T = 50 \\) hours.\n4.
