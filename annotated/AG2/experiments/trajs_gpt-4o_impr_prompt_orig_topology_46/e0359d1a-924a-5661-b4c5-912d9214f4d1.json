      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of candy available and then divide it equally among Robert, Cindy, and Aaron.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Amount of Candy:**\n   - Robert's candy: 3 pounds\n   - Cindy's candy: 5 pounds\n   - Aaron's candy: 4 pounds\n\n   Total candy \\( = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \\) pounds.\n\n2. **Divide the Total Amount of Candy Equally Among Three People:**\n\n   Since there are three people (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), each will get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Each person's share} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\text{ pounds of candy}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this calculation in Python using the sympy package to maintain the principle of using fractions when necessary.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# total amount of candy\ntotal_candy = 3 + 5 + 4\n\n# number of people\nnum_people = 3\n\n# each person's share of candy as a fraction\ncandy_per_person = Rational(total_candy, num_people)\n\n# printing the result formatted as a fraction\nprint(candy_per_person)\n```\n\nFinally, after running this code, we verify the output.\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n- We calculated the total candy correctly as 12 pounds.\n- We divided this total by 3 people, yielding exactly 4 pounds per person.\n- Our use of sympy's Rational ensures the result is verified as a fraction.\n\nEach person gets \\(\\boxed{4}\\) pounds of candy."
