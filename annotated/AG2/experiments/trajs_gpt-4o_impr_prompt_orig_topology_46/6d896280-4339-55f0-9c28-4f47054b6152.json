Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. If they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that amount on Friday, how many chimichangas do they make on Tuesday?"

      "content": "To find out how many chimichangas are made on Tuesday, let's go through a structured approach to solve the problem.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe need to express the problem in terms of algebraic equations using the information given. The solution involves setting up an equation in one variable and solving for it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday. \n   - Since the problem states they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, the number of chimichangas made on Wednesday is also \\( x \\).\n   - The number of chimichangas made on Friday is twice the amount made on Tuesday, which is \\( 2x \\).\n\n2. **Formulate Equation:**\n   - The total number of chimichangas made across these days is 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     x \\, (Tuesday) + x \\, (Wednesday) + 2x \\, (Friday) = 500\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify and Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\[\n     4x = 500\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Check if the total matches the given number:\n     - Tuesday: \\( 125 \\)\n     - Wednesday: \\( 125 \\)\n     - Friday: \\( 2 \\times 125 = 250 \\)\n     - Total: \\( 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \\)\n\n   The total is indeed 500, which confirms our solution.\n\nNow, let's output this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Represent the unknown\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# The equation based on the problem\nequation = Eq(x + x + 2 * x, 500)\n\n# Solving the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Printing the result as required\nprint(\"The number of chimichangas made on Tuesday is:\", solution[0])\n```\n\nIn conclusion, the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday is \\( \\boxed{125} \\)."
