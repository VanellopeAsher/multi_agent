Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first articulate the key concept necessary. We need to establish the number of seashells brought by each girl given certain conditions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Boys and Girls:**\n   - Since 200 kids are split into two equal groups of boys and girls, we have 100 boys and 100 girls.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Seashells Collected by Boys:**\n   - Each boy collects 600 shells. Thus, the total number of seashells collected by boys is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total shells by boys} = 100 \\times 600 = 60000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Total Number of Seashells Collected by Girls:**\n   - According to the problem, the number of shells collected by the girls is equal to the shells collected by boys plus four times the number of shells collected by the boys:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total shells by girls} = 60000 + 4 \\times 60000 = 300000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Seashells Per Girl:**\n   - Since the total number of seashells collected by the girls is 300000 and there are 100 girls, each girl collects:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Seashells per girl} = \\frac{300000}{100} = 3000\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's verify our solution:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- Total boys = 100, each collecting 600 shells, gives:\n  \\[\n  100 \\times 600 = 60000 \\text{ shells}\n  \\]\n\n- Total shells by girls is five times what boys collected:\n  \\[\n  60000 + 4 \\times 60000 = 300000 \\text{ shells}\n  \\]\n\n- Number of shells per girl:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{300000}{100} = 3000 \\text{ shells}\n  \\]\n\nAfter verifying each calculation, the number of seashells brought by each girl is correctly computed as \\(\\boxed{3000}\\)."
