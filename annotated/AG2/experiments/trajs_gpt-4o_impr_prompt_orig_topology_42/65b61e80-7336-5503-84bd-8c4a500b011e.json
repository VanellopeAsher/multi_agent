Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's use logical reasoning to break it down. Here's the structured approach we can follow:\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins.**\n   - Each Smith twin found 30 eggs.\n   - Therefore, the combined total for the twins is \\( 30 + 30 = 60 \\) eggs.\n\n2. **Understand the statement involving the friends.**\n   - The problem states that \"all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.\"\n   - This implies that out of all the eggs that were hidden, after the twins found their 60 eggs, all but 10 remaining eggs were found by the friends.\n\n3. **Calculate how many eggs the friends found.**\n   - If 10 eggs were not found by the friends, then we need to subtract these from the total number of remaining eggs after the twins have theirs to find how many eggs the friends found.\n\nNow to find out how many eggs the friends found:\n   - Total eggs hidden = Eggs found by twins + Eggs found by friends + Unfound eggs.\n   - Let's call the total hidden eggs \\( E \\).\n   - We know that the twins found 60 eggs, 10 eggs were not found, and the rest were found by the friends.\n\n4. **Express the equation for the problem:**\n   \\[\n   E = 60 + F + 10\n   \\]\n   where \\( F \\) represents the number of eggs found by the friends.\n\nSince we don't have the total number of eggs hidden \\( E \\), we can only proceed by using the information that simplifies it using what's given.\n\n5. **Find the number of eggs the friends found:**\n   Given what was hidden all except 10 were found by the friends after the twins took their share.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the friends found:\n   \\[\n   Friends\\_found = (E - 60) - 10\n   \\]\n   Since \\( (E - 70) \\) are those found by friends, the exact number is whatever remains as everything but 10 eggs found, subtracted by the twins' ones.\n\nTherefore the solution can be straightforward:\nThe initial 60 eggs found by twins, leaves 10 missing, so remaining eggs found can be:\n\n\\[ Friends\\_found = E - 60 - 10 = (E - 70) \\]\n\nWe denote the total found eggs as follows:\n- The question did not explicitly state more values; it aimed to test understanding of the remaining ones by logic. Thus ensuring 60 match the twins, friends would obviously find the non-twins-unfound scenario beyond 10 missing.\n\n\\[ \\text{{Friends found: }} 0 \\]\n\nThe hint from the context, every other egg found: zero simply includes rest after eliminate excepted rest balances directly:\n  \\(\\boxed{0}\\).\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- Verify by inferring setup, helps: Twins = 60. Rest not found = 10.\n- The problem essentially states the twins found all until 10 were missing.\n- Majority visit condition implies no additional unknowns were found by friends but essential pair as key given 10 uninvolved certainly positioned it.\n\nThus, the answer supported logically as processed:\n\n\\(\\boxed{0}\\).\n"
