Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, weâ€™ll use a straightforward mathematical approach to calculate the total protein intake based on John's daily mushroom consumption.\n\n### Key Idea\nThe problem involves unit conversion and multiplication to find the total amount of protein consumed in a week when given a daily intake.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms**:\n   - We know that a cup (150 grams) of mushrooms contains 4 grams of protein.\n   - This means that every gram of mushrooms contains \\( \\frac{4 \\text{ grams of protein}}{150 \\text{ grams of mushrooms}} \\) protein.\n\n2. **Calculate the protein content in 300 grams of mushrooms**:\n   - Since John eats 300 grams of mushrooms each day, the protein content in these 300 grams will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Protein per day} = 300 \\times \\frac{4}{150}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the weekly protein intake**:\n   - Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (days in a week) to find the weekly intake.\n\nLet's write the code to compute this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Determine protein per gram of mushroom\nprotein_per_gram = Rational(4, 150)\n\n# Step 2: Protein in 300 grams of mushrooms\ndaily_protein = 300 * protein_per_gram\n\n# Step 3: Weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein = 7 * daily_protein\n\nprint(weekly_protein)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Protein per gram of mushroom**:\n   - \\( \\frac{4}{150} = \\frac{2}{75} \\)\n\n2. **Daily protein intake calculation**:\n   - Protein in 300 grams = \\( 300 \\times \\frac{2}{75} = 300 \\times \\frac{2}{75} = \\frac{600}{75} = 8 \\) grams of protein per day.\n\n3. **Weekly protein intake**:\n   - \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\) grams of protein per week.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total grams of protein John gets per week is \\(\\boxed{56}\\)."
