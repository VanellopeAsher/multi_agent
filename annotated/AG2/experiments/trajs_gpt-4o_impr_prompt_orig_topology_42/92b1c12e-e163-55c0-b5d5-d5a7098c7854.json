Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to set up and solve a system of linear equations based on the relationships given between the ages of Carver, his daughter, and his son.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. Carver's current age is 45.\n2. Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.\n\n   Let \\( D \\) be the age of his daughter. Using the information given:\n   \\[\n   2D - 5 = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. The daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of the son.\n\n   Let \\( S \\) be the age of his son. We have:\n   \\[\n   D = 3S + 4\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations step by step.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. Solve the first equation for \\( D \\):\n   \\[\n   2D - 5 = 45 \\implies 2D = 50 \\implies D = 25\n   \\]\n\n2. Use the value of \\( D \\) (the daughter's age) in the second equation to solve for \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   25 = 3S + 4\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   3S = 25 - 4 \\implies 3S = 21 \\implies S = 7\n   \\]\n\nSo, Carver's son is 7 years old.\n\nLet's present the solution and proceed to verify:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the age variables\nD, S = symbols('D S', integer=True)\n\n# Equation from Carver's and daughter's age relationship\neq1 = Eq(2 * D - 5, 45)\n\n# Equation from daughter's and son's age relationship\neq2 = Eq(D, 3 * S + 4)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (D, S))\nage_son = solution[S]\n\n# Output son's age\nprint(age_son)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify Carver's age relationship:**  \n   \\( 2D - 5 = 45 \\)   \n   Substituting \\( D = 25 \\):  \n   \\( 2 \\times 25 - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45 \\). Correct!\n\n2. **Verify Daughter's and Son's age relationship:**  \n   \\( D = 3S + 4 \\)   \n   Substituting \\( D = 25 \\) and \\( S = 7 \\):  \n   \\( 25 = 3 \\times 7 + 4 \\rightarrow 25 = 21 + 4 \\). Correct!\n\nThe solution logic and calculations confirm our answer.\n\n\\[\\boxed{7}\\]"
