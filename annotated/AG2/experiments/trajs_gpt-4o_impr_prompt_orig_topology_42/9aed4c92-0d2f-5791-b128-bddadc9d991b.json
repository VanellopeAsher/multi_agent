Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark has $50.5 in his bank account. He earns $12.5 per day at his work. If he wants to buy a bike that costs $300.5, how many days does Mark have to save his money?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Mark has to work in order to save enough money to buy a bike costing $300.5. Let's go through the steps to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Funds Needed:**\n   - The bike costs $300.5, and Mark currently has $50.5. We need to find out how much more money he needs to reach his goal.\n\n2. **Determine the Total Additional Money Required:**\n   - Subtract Mark's current savings from the price of the bike to find out the additional amount of money required.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Needed:**\n   - Mark earns $12.5 per day. We'll calculate how many days are needed to earn the additional money required.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\n# Step 1: Define variables\ncurrent_savings = 50.5\nbike_cost = 300.5\ndaily_earnings = 12.5\n\n# Step 2: Calculate additional funds needed\nneeded_funds = bike_cost - current_savings\n\n# Step 3: Setup the equation for days\ndays = symbols('days')\nequation = Eq(daily_earnings * days, needed_funds)\n\n# Solve for the number of days\nnumber_of_days = solve(equation, days)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_days)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n1. Initial funds: $50.5. Bike cost: $300.5.\n2. Additional funds needed = $300.5 - $50.5 = $250.\n3. If Mark earns $12.5/day, then the number of days required to earn an additional $250 is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of days} = \\frac{250}{12.5} = 20\n   \\]\n\nAfter verifying each step, the calculations confirm the solution as expected.\n\nTherefore, the number of days Mark needs to work to buy the bike is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
