Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes, how much money she currently has, and how much more she needs to earn. We'll calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn to make up for the remaining amount.\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.\n2. Calculate the total amount of money Sara has after babysitting a set number of times.\n3. Calculate how much money is still needed.\n4. Determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to cover the remaining cost.\n\nWe'll use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Total cost calculation\njacket_cost = 120\nshoes_cost = 100 * 2  # 2 pairs of shoes\ntotal_cost = jacket_cost + shoes_cost\n\n# Earnings calculation\nsavings = 100\nbabysitting_earnings = 5 * 10  # $5 per babysitting session, 10 times\ncurrent_total = savings + babysitting_earnings\n\n# Money needed to afford the jacket and shoes\nmoney_needed = total_cost - current_total\n\n# Determine the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn\ntimes_mow = symbols('times_mow', positive=True, integer=True)\nmow_earning_per_time = 10\nequation = Eq(mow_earning_per_time * times_mow, money_needed)\n\n# Solve for the number of mowing times needed\nresult = solve(equation, times_mow)\n\nprint(f\"Sara needs to mow the lawn {result[0]} times to afford the jacket and shoes.\")\n```\n\nLetâ€™s verify the results step by step.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate total cost:**\n   - Jacket: $120\n   - Shoes: $100 each x 2 pairs = $200\n   - Total cost: $120 + $200 = $320\n\n2. **Calculate current savings:**\n   - Initial savings: $100\n   - Babysitting earnings: $5 x 10 = $50\n   - Total current savings: $100 + $50 = $150\n\n3. **Calculate additional money needed:**\n   - Total needed: $320\n   - Current savings: $150\n   - Remaining amount: $320 - $150 = $170\n\n4. **Determine times to mow the lawn:**\n   - Earning per mow: $10\n   - Mow times needed: \\( \\frac{170}{10} = 17 \\)\n\nThrough recalculations, I confirm that the solution requires Sara to mow the lawn 17 times.\n\nThus, Sara must mow the lawn \\(\\boxed{17}\\) times to afford the jacket and shoes."

She currently has saved up $150 after her initial savings and babysitting earnings. She still needs $170.\n\nSince each time she mows the lawn she earns $10, the number of times she needs to mow the lawn to make up the $170 is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\frac{170}{10} = 17 \\]\n\nSo, Sara needs to mow the lawn \\(\\boxed{17}\\) times to earn the remaining amount needed to afford the jacket and shoes. \n\nThis completes the problem, and the final answer is already confirmed as correct: \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."
