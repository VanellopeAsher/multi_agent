Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser.

From the problem, we know he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.\n\n2. **Sunday**:\n   - Gingerbread: Since Sunny sold 5 more boxes than he did on Saturday, he sold \\( 10 + 5 = 15 \\) boxes.\n   - Apple pie: Given that he sold 15 boxes.\n\n3. **Monday**:\n   - Gingerbread: 2 boxes\n   - Apple pie: 4 boxes\n\nGiven the above information, we can infer:\n- On Saturday, the number of apple pies sold (\\( x \\)) was 4 fewer than on Sunday: \n  \\[\n  x = 15 - 4 = 11\n  \\]\n\n### Calculating the Earnings\n\n- **Cost**:\n  - Gingerbread: $6 per box\n  - Apple pie: $15 per box\n\nLet's calculate the total earnings:\n\n#### Saturday\n- Gingerbread earnings: \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\) dollars\n- Apple pie earnings: \\( 11 \\times 15 = 165 \\) dollars\n\n#### Sunday\n- Gingerbread earnings: \\( 15 \\times 6 = 90 \\) dollars\n- Apple pie earnings: \\( 15 \\times 15 = 225 \\) dollars\n\n#### Monday\n- Gingerbread earnings: \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) dollars\n- Apple pie earnings: \\( 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\) dollars\n\n### Total Earnings Calculation\n\nLet's sum up the earnings from all three days:\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python and printing the result\ngingerbread_cost = 6\napple_pie_cost = 15\n\n# Calculate Saturday earnings\nsaturday_gingerbread_earnings = 10 * gingerbread_cost\nsaturday_apple_pie_earnings = 11 * apple_pie_cost\n\n# Calculate Sunday earnings\nsunday_gingerbread_earnings = 15 * gingerbread_cost\nsunday_apple_pie_earnings = 15 * apple_pie_cost\n\n# Calculate Monday earnings\nmonday_gingerbread_earnings = 2 * gingerbread_cost\nmonday_apple_pie_earnings = 4 * apple_pie_cost\n\n# Total earnings\ntotal_earnings = (saturday_gingerbread_earnings + saturday_apple_pie_earnings +\n                   sunday_gingerbread_earnings + sunday_apple_pie_earnings +\n                   monday_gingerbread_earnings + monday_apple_pie_earnings)\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the results by following through the step-by-step calculations outlined above:\n- All computations align with the problem statement.\n- Each day's sales and corresponding earnings are calculated correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final result, representing Sunny's earnings over the three days, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{612} \\] dollars."
