Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.

      "content": "We can solve this problem by calculating the total cost of each item Scarlett bought and then summing them up.\n\nLet's break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the aquarium.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the two bags of rocks.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the three pieces of coral.\n4. Calculate the cost of the fish food.\n5. Sum all these costs to find the total amount spent.\n\nWe can use Python to compute this, ensuring to follow the specified code requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs of each item\naquarium_cost = Rational(10)\nrock_bag_cost = Rational(2.50)\nrocks_total_cost = 2 * rock_bag_cost\ncoral_piece_cost = Rational(2.00)\ncoral_total_cost = 3 * coral_piece_cost\nfish_food_cost = Rational(2.00)\n\n# Total spend calculation\ntotal_spent = aquarium_cost + rocks_total_cost + coral_total_cost + fish_food_cost\n\n# Display the total cost\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will give us the total amount Scarlett spent, following the outlined approach. Let's break down the key lines:\n\n1. We defined the cost for each type of item using `Rational` to ensure the use of fractions instead of decimals.\n2. We calculated the total cost for the rocks and corals by multiplying the price per unit by the quantity.\n3. We summed all the individual costs to get `total_spent`.\n4. Finally, the result is printed using the `print` function.\n\nUpon running the above Python code, it would display the total amount Scarlett spent on her aquarium setup.\n\nLet's verify the result step by step to ensure accuracy:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- Aquarium cost: $10.00\n- Rocks cost: \\(2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\\)\n- Coral cost: \\(3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00\\)\n- Fish food cost: $2.00\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\\[ 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = 23.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Scarlett spent a total of $23.00.\n\nThe calculation is verified as correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is: \\(\\boxed{23}\\)"
