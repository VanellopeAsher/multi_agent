Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of brownies Greta received and subtract the number of brownies that were eaten at the party. Let's break it down step by step using calculations in Python.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Determine the number of brownies Greta initially made for herself:**\n   - Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since there are 12 in a dozen, she made `12` brownies.\n\n2. **Count the number of brownies received from her office:**\n   - Her office gave her 1/2 dozen brownies, which amounts to `6` brownies.\n\n3. **Count the number of brownies from the surprise party:**\n   - Her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, totaling `4 * 12 = 48` brownies.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially:**\n   - Add the brownies from all sources: `12 + 6 + 48`.\n\n5. **Subtract the number of brownies eaten at the party:**\n   - 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten at the party, which is `1.5 * 12 = 18` brownies.\n\n6. **Find the leftover brownies:**\n   - Subtract the brownies eaten from the total number Greta had.\n\nLet's perform these calculations in Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python\n\n# Number of brownies Greta made\nbrownies_greta_made = 12  # 1 dozen\n\n# Number of brownies Greta received from her office\nbrownies_from_office = 6  # 1/2 dozen\n\n# Number of brownies at the surprise party\nbrownies_at_party = 4 * 12  # 4 dozen\n\n# Total brownies Greta had\ntotal_brownies = brownies_greta_made + brownies_from_office + brownies_at_party\n\n# Number of brownies eaten at the party\nbrownies_eaten = int(1.5 * 12)  # 1 1/2 dozen\n\n# Calculate leftover brownies\nleftover_brownies = total_brownies - brownies_eaten\n\n# Print the result\nprint(leftover_brownies)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Initial Calculations:**\n   - Made: 12\n   - From Office: 6\n   - From Party: 48\n   - Total: \\( 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \\)\n\n2. **Brownies Eaten:**\n   - 1 1/2 dozen = 18\n\n3. **Leftover Calculation:**\n   - \\( 66 - 18 = 48 \\)\n\nAfter verifying each step of the calculations, we derive that Greta has 48 brownies left over from her entire day.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{48}\\)."
