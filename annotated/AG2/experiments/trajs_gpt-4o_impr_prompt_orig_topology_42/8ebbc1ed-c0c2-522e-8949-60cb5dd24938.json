      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much of the chalk is used over a series of days and determine when the chalk reaches the unusable length of 2 inches. Here's how we can solve it:\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding Initial Usage:**\n   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk. This is 1.5 times his usual usage, so we can calculate his usual daily usage as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Usual daily usage} = \\frac{45\\%}{1.5} = 30\\%\n     \\]\n     However, the problem states he aims for 20% usage, suggesting that the 45% used included some extra amount beyond the usual 20%.\n\n2. **Re-calculate normal daily usage:**\n   - If 45% is 1.5 times his usual usage, then:\n     \\[\n     x = \\text{percentage used on a normal day} = \\frac{45\\%}{1.5} = 30\\%.\n     \\]\n\n   But this conflicts with the stated goal of 20%, so let's actually use what was originally given:\n   \\[\n     \\text{Percentage beyond usual plan} = 45\\% - 20\\% = 25\\%.\n   \\]\n   Since 25% is 1.5 times his additional usage for Monday, let's revise:\n     \\[\n    \\text{Actual usual daily percentage the teacher aims for: } = \\frac{25\\%}{0.5} = 50\\%.\n   \\]\n   \n   **But initial plan was 20% use, so 1.5 usual on Monday** can be 45%:\n   \n3. **Calculate Remaining Chalk:**\n   - After Monday, remaining chalk:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining chalk} = 5 - (0.45 \\times 5) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \\text{ inches}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine Days Left Using 20% Rule:**\n   - The goal is to check how many full days he can run with the remaining chalk until it drops below 2 inches while using 20% usage per day.\n   \n   - Daily usage from now on: \\( 20\\% \\) of 5 inches is 1 inch per day.\n   \n   - Remaining usable chalk is 2.75 inches. Every day the teacher uses 1 inch.\n   \n5. **Calculating the Number of Days:**\n   - Calculate how many days he can write with following the remaining chalk & limitation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2.75}{0.2 \\times 5 } = \\frac{2.75}{1.0} = 2.75\n     \\]\n   - He cannot write for a fraction of the day, so 2 days are fully usable according to plan.\n\n6. **Final Result:**\n   - The chalk will reach less than 2 inches beyond two days at 20% usage per day:\n     \n```python\n# Python code for visualization\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nchalk_length_initial = 5  # in inches\nchalk_used_monday = Rational(45, 100) * chalk_length_initial\nchalk_remainder_after_monday = chalk_length_initial - chalk_used_monday\nusable_chalk_limit = 2  # in inches\ndaily_usage_percent = Rational(20, 100)\ndaily_usage_amount = daily_usage_percent * chalk_length_initial\n\ndays_possible = 0\nchalk_remaining = chalk_remainder_after_monday\n\nwhile chalk_remaining > usable_chalk_limit:\n    chalk_remaining -= daily_usage_amount\n    days_possible += 1\n\nprint(\"Total usable days:\", days_possible)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n- Started with 5 inches.\n- After Monday usage, remaining: 2.75 inches, calculated correctly.\n- Daily usage is set to deduct until chalk < 2 inches, confirming two full days.\n\nTherefore, the number of days after Monday before the chalk becomes less than 2 inches is \\( \\boxed{2} \\)."

Therefore, the number of usable days is \\( \\boxed{1} \\).\n\n**Verification:**\n- Monday usage: 45%, remaining 2.75 inches.\n- Tuesday usage: 20% of initial, so leftovers become 1.75 inches, below usability.\n\nConclusively, the chalk is usable for \\( \\boxed{1} \\) more day after Monday."
