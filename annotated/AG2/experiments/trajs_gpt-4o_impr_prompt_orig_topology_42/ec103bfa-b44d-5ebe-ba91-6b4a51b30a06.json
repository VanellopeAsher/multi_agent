Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $900. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $57?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered given the total amount she paid and the costs of the other items.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples.\n2. Subtract these costs from the total amount Marie paid to find the remaining amount spent on pizza.\n3. Divide the remaining amount by the cost per box of pizza to find the number of boxes.\n\nLet's work through these steps using Python and the `sympy` library to handle any calculations symbolically.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the costs\nchicken_meal_cost = 120\nmilk_pack_cost = 30\nnum_milk_packs = 5\napple_cost = 1.5\nnum_apples = 40\npizza_box_cost = 57\ntotal_paid = 900\n\n# Calculate total cost of chicken meal, milk packs, and apples\ntotal_chicken_meal_cost = chicken_meal_cost\ntotal_milk_cost = milk_pack_cost * num_milk_packs\ntotal_apple_cost = apple_cost * num_apples\n\n# Calculate the total initial cost\ntotal_initial_cost = total_chicken_meal_cost + total_milk_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# Calculate the remaining amount spent on pizza\nremaining_amount = total_paid - total_initial_cost\n\n# Use sympy to solve for the number of pizza boxes\nnum_boxes = symbols('num_boxes')\nequation = num_boxes * pizza_box_cost - remaining_amount\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, num_boxes)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(\"Number of boxes of pizza ordered:\", solution[0])\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. Calculate the sum of costs for non-pizza items:\n   - Chicken meal: $120\n   - 5 Milk packs: \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\)\n   - 40 Apples: \\(40 \\times 1.5 = 60\\)\n\n   Total initial cost = \\(120 + 150 + 60 = 330\\)\n\n2. Remaining amount for pizza:\n   - Total paid: $900\n   - Total initial cost: $330\n\n   Remaining amount = \\(900 - 330 = 570\\)\n\n3. Number of pizza boxes:\n   - Each box costs: $57\n\n   \\(\\frac{570}{57} = 10\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\nMarie ordered \\(\\boxed{10}\\) boxes of pizza."
