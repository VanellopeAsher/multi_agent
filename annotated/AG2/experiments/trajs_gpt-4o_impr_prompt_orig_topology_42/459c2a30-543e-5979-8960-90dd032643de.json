Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and much fewer white squares than green squares.  Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet. How much fewer are white squares  than green squares?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white squares in Brittany's quilted comforter and determine how much fewer the white squares are compared to the green squares. Let's work through the problem step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify known quantities:**\n\n   - Red squares: \\( R = 14 \\)\n   - Blue squares: \\( B = R + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18 \\)\n   - Green squares: \\( G = B + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \\)\n\n2. **Total area and its constraint:**\n\n   Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet. Thus, the total number of squares, including white squares (\\( W \\)), should add up to 68:\n\n   \\[\n   R + B + G + W = 68\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the known values:**\n\n   \\[\n   14 + 18 + 24 + W = 68\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of white squares:**\n\n   \\[\n   56 + W = 68 \n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   W = 68 - 56 = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how much fewer the white squares are than the green squares:**\n\n   \\[\n   G - W = 24 - 12 = 12\n   \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify by checking if all conditions are satisfied:\n\n- Red squares = 14\n- Blue squares = 18\n- Green squares = 24\n- White squares = 12\n\nSum check: \n\n\\[\n14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\n\\]\n\nEverything adds up correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe white squares are fewer than the green squares by:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
