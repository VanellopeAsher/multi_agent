Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is wrapping Christmas gifts. She has 6 gifts to wrap for her family, 4 gifts to wrap for her friends and 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers. She wants to make a bow for each gift. How many inches of ribbon can she use for each gift bow?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many inches of ribbon are available for each gift bow. However, the problem as currently presented does not provide the total amount of ribbon Monica has. Without this piece of information, the problem is unsolvable.\n\nGiven the current details, here's the verification step confirming that additional information is necessary:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Count the Total Gifts:** \n   - Gifts for Family: 6\n   - Gifts for Friends: 4\n   - Gifts for Teachers: 2\n   - Total Gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12\n\n2. **Wrap Each Gift:**\n   - Monica intends to make one bow per gift, so we need ribbon for each of the 12 gifts.\n\n3. **Missing Data:**\n   - Total ribbon length is not specified in the problem, which is crucial to calculating how much ribbon can be used per gift.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the total ribbon Monica has, it's impossible to determine the exact amount of ribbon she can use per gift. So, the problem is unsolvable in its current form.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None}} \\]\n\nIf you have additional information, such as the total length of ribbon available, please provide it so we can proceed with the calculation."
