      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow the Direct Python Solution approach. We need to determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th. Below is the structured reasoning and solution:\n\n### Key Concept:\n1. **Weight Loss to Calorie Deficit Conversion:** It is given that Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound.\n2. **Time Frame Calculation:** From December 31st to July 19th is the period in which he wants to achieve his weight loss goal.\n3. **Daily Calorie Deficit:** To find the daily deficit, we first calculate the total calorie deficit and then divide it by the number of days in the given period.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Calorie Deficit Needed:**\n   - To lose 30 lbs, Andy needs to burn \\(30 \\times 3500\\) calories.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Days from December 31st to July 19th:**\n   - Let's calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.\n \n3. **Compute the Daily Calorie Deficit:**\n   - Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find the daily requirement.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Calculate total calories needed to burn\npounds_to_lose = 30\ncalories_per_pound = 3500\ntotal_calories_needed = pounds_to_lose * calories_per_pound\n\n# Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th\nstart_date = datetime(2023, 12, 31)\nend_date = datetime(2024, 7, 19)\ndays_delta = (end_date - start_date).days\n\n# Calculate daily calorie deficit\ndaily_calorie_deficit = total_calories_needed / days_delta\n\n# Output the result\ndaily_calorie_deficit_fraction = sp.Rational(total_calories_needed, days_delta)\nprint(\"The daily calorie deficit needed:\", daily_calorie_deficit_fraction)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Total Calorie Deficit:** \n   \\[\n   30 \\, \\text{lbs} \\times 3500 \\, \\text{calories/lb} = 105,000 \\, \\text{calories}\n   \\]\n2. **Number of Days Calculation:**\n   - Verify the count from Dec 31 to July 19 (assuming the year transition):\n     - January: 31 days\n     - February: 29 days (leap year 2024)\n     - March: 31 days\n     - April: 30 days\n     - May: 31 days\n     - June: 30 days\n     - July until 19th: 19 days\n   - Total: 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days\n\n3. **Daily Calorie Deficit Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{105,000 \\, \\text{calories}}{201 \\, \\text{days}} = \\text{Daily Calorie Deficit}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations show that Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of \\(\\frac{105000}{201}\\) calories, which will be output in fraction form by SymPy as requested.\n\nThe final answer is: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3500}{67}}\\)."
