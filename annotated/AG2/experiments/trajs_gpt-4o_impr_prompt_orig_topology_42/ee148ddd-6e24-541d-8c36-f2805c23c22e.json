Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to carefully calculate the total activity time and then figure out 40% of it.\n\n### Breakdown of Activities\n\n1. **Boating**: 6 hours\n2. **Swimming**: Half the time spent boating, i.e., \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours\n3. **Watching shows**: 3 shows, each 2 hours, totaling \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\nThe total time spent on these activities (boating, swimming, and watching shows) is:\n\\[\n6 \\, \\text{(boating)} + 3 \\, \\text{(swimming)} + 6 \\, \\text{(watching shows)} = 15 \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\nWe know that this time constitutes 30% of the total time John spent on activities. Let's denote the total activity time as \\( T \\).\n\n\\[ 0.3 \\times T = 15 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( T \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{15}{0.3} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the total time T\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Set up the equation according to the given data\nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, 15)\n\n# Solve for T\ntotal_time_spent = solve(equation, T)[0]\nprint(total_time_spent)\n```\n\nGiven that we've found \\( T \\), we can now calculate the time spent sightseeing.\nSince 40% of the total time is spent sightseeing:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sightseeing Time} = 0.4 \\times T \\]\n\nFinally, calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sightseeing time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time_spent\n\n# Print the sightseeing time\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. We found total activity time \\( T = \\frac{15}{0.3} = 50 \\) hours. This corresponds correctly with 30% being 15 hours.\n2. For sightseeing: \n   \\[ \\text{Sightseeing Time} = 0.4 \\times 50 = 20 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, after verification, we conclude the time John spent sightseeing is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"
