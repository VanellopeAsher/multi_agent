Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties. He spent $300 on yellow ties that cost $30 each. How much did he spend on ties?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps. The primary task is to calculate how much John spent on ties. We have some key information about the ties:\n\n1. **Yellow Ties**: \n   - Cost: $30 each\n   - Total amount spent on yellow ties: $300\n\n2. **Green Ties**: \n   - Green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties.\n\n3. **Red and Blue Ties**: \n   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.\n\nLet's handle each part step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Number of Yellow Ties\nJohn spends $300 on yellow ties, each costing $30. Therefore, the number of yellow ties is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Yellow Ties} = \\frac{\\text{Total Money Spent on Yellow Ties}}{\\text{Cost of Each Yellow Tie}} = \\frac{300}{30} = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of Green Ties\nSince green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties, the cost of each green tie is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of Each Green Tie} = 30 + 0.7 \\times 30 = 30 + 21 = 51\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Red and Blue Ties\nWe don't have explicit information on how much John spent on red and blue ties or a specific number for them, so they might not be crucial for the total expenditure calculation in terms of exact amounts unless more details are provided.\n\nGiven this situation where no additional information is provided about the number or price of red and blue ties, we assume these details were distractions or not meant for the total sum calculation.\n\n### Step 4: Verification and Calculation of Total Expenditure\nWe should verify we considered all pertinent information regarding expenditures provided:\n\n- Yellow tie expenditure is verifiable and comes to $300.\n- There's no direct spending amount given for red, blue, or green ties in monetary value other than their relation, so unless green ties speculatively have been bought in the same number, it's undetermined without specific quantity/money information.\n\nThe ambiguity mainly lies because only yellow ties have specified expenditure, not the others. As per instructions and lacking numbers for other ties:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Money John spent on Ties (given conditions and information)} = 300 + \\text{(Ambiguity/Undisclosed for other ties)} \\]\n\nDue to the missing data on specific expenditure for red, blue, and potentially green under further quantities outside existing given, the broader calculation remains unopened:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None}} \\] (for the entirety inclusively without more numeric insights). If exclusion due to lack is to restate just the confirmed known:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\] (on what's verified, yellow tie expenditure)."
