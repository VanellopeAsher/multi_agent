Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. Each final is cut into 5 cm. How long is the ribbon?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to determine the length of the ribbon that Marty starts with. Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n### Key Idea and Concept\n\nMarty divides the ribbon into 4 equal parts, then each of those parts into 5 equal parts, and finally, each of the smallest pieces is exactly 5 cm long. Let's work through the problem step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Find the length of each small piece:**\n   - Each small piece is 5 cm long.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of small pieces:**\n   - Since the ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts, and each of those is further divided into 5 equal parts, the total number of small pieces is \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total length of the ribbon:**\n   - Since each of the 20 small pieces is 5 cm long, the total length of the ribbon is \\(20 \\times 5\\) cm.\n\nLet's now perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Calculate the number of small pieces\ntotal_small_pieces = 4 * 5\n\n# Length of each small piece\nlength_of_each_small_piece = 5  # cm\n\n# Calculate the total length of the ribbon\ntotal_ribbon_length = total_small_pieces * length_of_each_small_piece\n\n# Output the total length\nprint(total_ribbon_length)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's double-check each step:\n\n1. **Total number of small pieces:**\n   - \\(4\\) parts, each divided into \\(5\\) parts gives \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) small pieces.\n\n2. **Each small piece's length:**\n   - It is given as exactly \\(5\\) cm.\n\n3. **Total length calculation:**\n   - The total length is \\(20 \\times 5 = 100\\) cm.\n\nThe solution checks out with the problem conditions.\n\nHence, the length of the ribbon is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) cm."

Marty divides the ribbon into 4 equal parts.\n2. He further divides each of those parts into 5 smaller equal parts.\n3. Each of these smallest parts is 5 cm long.\n4. Thus, there are \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) such small parts.\n5. Since each small part is 5 cm long, the total length of the ribbon is \\(20 \\times 5 = 100\\) cm.\n\nThe original length of the ribbon is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) cm."
