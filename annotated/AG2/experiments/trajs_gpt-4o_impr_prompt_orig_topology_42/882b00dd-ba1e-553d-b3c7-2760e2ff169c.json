Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll perform several calculations to determine the earnings of Billy and Sally after working 20 hours, taking into consideration their respective salary increments. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate Billy's earnings:**\n   - Initial hourly rate: \\(10\\) dollars per hour.\n   - After 2 months, his rate increases by \\(0.50\\) dollars, making it \\(10.50\\) dollars per hour.\n   - After 1 year, he receives another raise of \\(1.00\\) dollar, making his hourly rate \\(11.50\\) dollars.\n   - Thus, after 1 year, Billy's hourly rate is \\(11.50\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate Sally's earnings:**\n   - Sally's initial rate is \\(0.50\\) dollars more than Billy's starting rate, which is \\(10 + 0.50 = 10.50\\) dollars per hour.\n   - After 2 months, her rate increases by \\(0.50\\) dollars, making it \\(11.00\\) dollars per hour.\n   - Sally is currently working at this rate of \\(11.00\\) dollars per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work:**\n   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours: \\(11.50 \\times 20\\)\n   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours: \\(11.00 \\times 20\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the difference in their earnings:**\n   - Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings\n\nLet's compute these calculations using Python as requested:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of earnings\nbilly_hourly_rate = 11.50\nsally_hourly_rate = 11.00\n\nbilly_earnings = billy_hourly_rate * 20  # earnings for Billy for 20 hours\nsally_earnings = sally_hourly_rate * 20  # earnings for Sally for 20 hours\n\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Print the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the amount by which Billy's earnings exceed Sally's for 20 hours of work.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Verify Billy's starting rate: \\(\\$10\\).\n2. Verify Billy's rate after 2 months: \\(\\$10 + \\$0.50 = \\$10.50\\).\n3. Verify Billy's rate after 1 year: \\(\\$10.50 + \\$1.00 = \\$11.50\\).\n4. Verify Sally's initial rate: \\(\\$10 + \\$0.50 = \\$10.50\\).\n5. Verify Sally's rate after 2 months: \\(\\$10.50 + \\$0.50 = \\$11.00\\).\n6. Check calculations for 20-hour work:\n   - Billy: \\(11.50 \\times 20 = 230\\) dollars.\n   - Sally: \\(11.00 \\times 20 = 220\\) dollars.\n7. Difference: \\(230 - 220 = 10\\) dollars.\n\nThe calculations are correct, therefore, the difference in earnings is: \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars."
