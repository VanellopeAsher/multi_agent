      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spent on various activities and use that information to determine the time spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's break down John's activities:\n\n1. **Boating:** 60 hours\n2. **Swimming:** Half the time of boating, which is \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) hours\n3. **Watching Shows:** 30 shows at 20 hours each, which totals \\( 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\) hours\n\nAccording to the problem, the 600 hours he spent watching shows accounts for 30% of his total vacation time. We need to find the total time and then calculate the time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total vacation time.\n\n**Step-by-step process:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Vacation Time:**\n   Given that 600 hours is 30% of the total time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\frac{600 \\text{ hours}}{0.30}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   Sightseeing time is 40% of the total vacation time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sightseeing time} = 0.40 \\times \\text{Total time}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these using Python with the help of sympy for exact fractions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\ntotal_time = symbols('total_time')\n\n# Calculate total vacation time\ntotal_time_eq = Rational(600, total_time) - Rational(3, 10)  # 600 is 30% of total time\ntotal_vacation_time = solve(total_time_eq, total_time)[0]\n\n# Calculate sightseeing time\nsightseeing_time = total_vacation_time * Rational(4, 10)  # 40% of total time\n\n# Print the result as an exact fraction\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nNow, let's run through the VERIFICATION process:\n\n1. **Verify Total Time Calculation:**\n   From the equation \\( 600 = 0.30 \\times \\text{Total time} \\), we solve and find that the total vacation time should be 2000 hours, as expected.\n\n2. **Verify Sightseeing Time Calculation:**\n   With the total time found to be 2000 hours, 40% of this corresponds to \\( 2000 \\times 0.40 = 800 \\) hours. This matches our calculations.\n\nSince both the calculations check out, we are confident in our solution. Thus, the final result is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{800}\\)"

The previous attempt had a conceptual error when defining `Rational` with a symbolic denominator.
