  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories.

      "content": "To determine how much money Elvira will have left to spend on her new outfit, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she decided to purchase and subtract that amount from her total budget.\n\nLet's tackle this step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of Purchased Items:**\n   - Computer setup: €1090\n   - Scanner: €157\n   - CD burner: €74\n   - Printer: €102\n\n2. **Total Budget and Calculation:**\n   - Total budget: €1500\n\nNow, let's use Python to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Let's calculate the total expenditure\ncomputer_setup = 1090\nscanner = 157\ncd_burner = 74\nprinter = 102\n\n# Summing up the cost of items Elvira bought\ntotal_cost = computer_setup + scanner + cd_burner + printer\n\n# Given total budget\ntotal_budget = 1500\n\n# Calculate the remaining money\nremaining_money = total_budget - total_cost\n\n# Display the remaining money using the print function\nprint(f\"The remaining money for Elvira's new outfit is €{remaining_money}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will display the amount of money Elvira has left to spend on her new outfit, after purchasing her computer setup and accessories.\n\nLet's carry out the calculation and provide the final result:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining Money} = 1500 - 1423 = 77\n\\]\n\nThus, the remaining money for Elvira's new outfit is \\( \\boxed{77} \\).\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Item Costs:**\n   - Computer setup: Correctly accounted as €1090.\n   - Scanner: Correctly accounted as €157.\n   - CD Burner: Correctly accounted as €74.\n   - Printer: Correctly accounted as €102.\n\n2. **Summation of Costs:**\n   - Verify the total cost: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.\n\n3. **Verification of Remaining Money:**\n   - Initial budget: €1500.\n   - Subtraction logic yields remaining money: €1500 - €1423 = €77.\n\nThis matches our computed answer; therefore, the result is confirmed as correct: \\( \\boxed{77} \\)."
