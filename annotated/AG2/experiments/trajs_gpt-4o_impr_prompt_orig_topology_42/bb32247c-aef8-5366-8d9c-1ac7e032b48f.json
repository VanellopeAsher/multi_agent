Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was several inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow the step-by-step process, calculating the height of the beanstalk week by week.\n\n**Step 1: Define initial parameters.**\nLet's denote the initial height of the beanstalk at the end of week one as \\( h \\) inches.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the height after each week.**\n- **End of Week 1:** The height is \\( h \\) inches.\n- **End of Week 2:** The height doubles. Thus, it is \\( 2h \\).\n- **End of Week 3:** An additional 4 inches are added to the Week 2 height. Therefore, the final height is \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Code Implementation in Python.**\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the initial height variable\nh = symbols('h')\n\n# Calculate the final height after week 3\nfinal_height = 2 * h + 4\nfinal_height_simplified = simplify(final_height)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(final_height_simplified)\n```\n\nThis code uses symbolic computation to express the final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks. \n\n**Verification:**\n1. **Initial Height:** Assume \\( h = \\text{height after week 1} \\).\n2. **Week 2 Calculation:** It is correctly calculated as \\( 2h \\).\n3. **Week 3 Calculation:** Adding 4 inches to \\( 2h \\) results in \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nThe calculated final height expression \\( 2h + 4 \\) is consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{2h + 4} \\), where \\( h \\) is the height in inches at the end of week one."

The beanstalk doubles its height in week 2: \\( 2h \\).\n3. An additional 4 inches growth in week 3: \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nThis mathematical model accurately describes the situation when \\( h \\) is unknown.\n\nIf you intended to find a specific numerical result rather than a symbolic one, you would need to provide the specific value of \\( h \\) to proceed with numerical calculations.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n1. Ensure clarity on initial assumptions.\n2. Verify all calculations match the described growth process.\n3. Confirm that any needed further calculations or inputs are available.\n\nThe height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, symbolically represented as \\( 2h + 4 \\), adheres to the process described without further specific numerical inputs from the problem statement itself.\n\nIf you have additional conditions or a given initial height, feel free to provide them, and we can adjust calculations accordingly.
