Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards. There is a total of 447 cards. Becca has 15 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards that PJ has. How many cards does Becca have?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into equations based on the information given. Let's define some variables:\n\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of cards Becca has.\n- Let \\( S \\) be the number of cards Smendrick has.\n- Let \\( P \\) be the number of cards PJ has.\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n\n1. The total number of cards is 447.\n   \\[\n   B + S + P = 447\n   \\]\n2. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick.\n   \\[\n   B = S + 15\n   \\]\n3. Smendrick has 4 times the number of cards as PJ.\n   \\[\n   S = 4P\n   \\]\n\nUsing these equations, we can solve for \\( B \\), \\( S \\), and \\( P \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Substitute \\( S \\) from equation 3 into equation 2:\n   \\[\n   B = 4P + 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute \\( B \\) and \\( S \\) from equations 1 and 2 into equation 1:\n   \\[\n   (4P + 15) + 4P + P = 447\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   9P + 15 = 447\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   9P = 447 - 15\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9P = 432\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{432}{9} = 48\n   \\]\n\n5. Now, find \\( S \\) using the value of \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 4P = 4 \\times 48 = 192\n   \\]\n\n6. Lastly, find \\( B \\) using the value of \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   B = S + 15 = 192 + 15 = 207\n   \\]\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Verify the total:\n   \\[\n   B + S + P = 207 + 192 + 48 = 447\n   \\]\n   The total number matches, which confirms our steps.\n\n2. Verify the relationship:\n   - Becca has 15 more than Smendrick: \\( 207 = 192 + 15 \\)\n   - Smendrick has 4 times the cards as PJ: \\( 192 = 4 \\times 48 \\)\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the number of cards Becca has is \\(\\boxed{207}\\)."
