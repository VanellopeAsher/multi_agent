      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJolene and her friends are celebrating the start of summer with a water balloon battle. They prepare 10 sets of balloons, each set containing 30 balloons. By the time the afternoon ends, there are only 12 balloons remaining. How many balloons were used in their water balloon fight?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of balloons that were used in the water balloon fight. We have the following information:\n\n1. Jolene and her friends prepared 10 sets of balloons.\n2. Each set contains 30 balloons.\n3. By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left.\n\nLet's break down the problem into manageable steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of balloons initially prepared.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons remaining to find out how many balloons were used.\n\nLet's use Python to solve this problem using these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of balloons initially prepared\ntotal_balloons_prepared = 10 * 30\n\n# Step 2: Subtract the number of balloons remaining to find out how many were used\nballoons_used = total_balloons_prepared - 12\n\n# Output the result\nprint(balloons_used)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify our solution:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of balloons initially prepared:**\n   - 10 sets of 30 balloons each results in \\(10 \\times 30 = 300\\) balloons.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of balloons used:**\n   - 300 initially prepared balloons minus 12 balloons remaining gives \\(300 - 12 = 288\\) balloons used.\n\nThe calculations are correct. Now, we can present the final result:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]"
