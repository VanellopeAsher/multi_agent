Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon. Given that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5, can you determine the total sum of money she expended on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the jars and calculate the total expense Cecelia incurred. Let's break this problem into manageable steps:\n\n1. **Find the price of a one-gallon jar:** We are informed that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5.\n2. **Find the price of a half-gallon jar:** We know it is $2 cheaper than a one-gallon jar. Therefore, the price of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3.\n3. **Calculate the total cost for the jars:**\n   - For the one-gallon jars: Cecelia bought 10 jars. Thus, the cost will be \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) dollars.\n   - For the half-gallon jars: Cecelia bought 16 jars. Thus, the cost will be \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\) dollars.\n4. **Compute the total expenditure:** Add the costs of one-gallon jars and half-gallon jars together.\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations and print out the total.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the price of each type of jar\nprice_one_gallon = 5  # dollars\nprice_half_gallon = price_one_gallon - 2  # dollars\n\n# Calculate the total cost for 10 one-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars\ntotal_cost_one_gallon = 10 * price_one_gallon\ntotal_cost_half_gallon = 16 * price_half_gallon\n\n# Calculate the total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = total_cost_one_gallon + total_cost_half_gallon\n\n# Print the total expenditure\nprint(total_expenditure)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the calculations step by step.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Price of half-gallon jar:**  \n   - Calculation: \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n   - Verified, correct as per given instruction.\n\n2. **Cost for one-gallon jars:**  \n   - Calculation: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\)\n   - Verified, correct.\n\n3. **Cost for half-gallon jars:**  \n   - Calculation: \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\)\n   - Verified, correct.\n\n4. **Total expenditure:**  \n   - Calculation: \\(50 + 48 = 98\\)\n   - Verified, correct.\n\nThe final result is the total sum of money Cecelia expended on purchasing the jars, which is \\(\\boxed{98}\\) dollars."
