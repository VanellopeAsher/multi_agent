Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount collected by Walter and then determine how much his lawyer will contribute.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Total Contribution by Walter's Neighbors and Online Fund:**\n   - Money collected from neighbors: $300\n   - Money collected from the online fund: $1200\n\n   Calculate the total collected amount (excluding the lawyer and his friend):  \n   \\( \\text{Total collected} = 300 + 1200 \\)\n\n2. **Calculating the Lawyer's Contribution:**\n   - The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else's donation.\n   - Contribution by neighbors and online fund: \\( 300 + 1200 = 1500 \\)\n   - Lawyer's contribution: \\( 3 \\times 1500 \\)\n\n3. **Friend's Contribution:**\n   - Walter's friend donates $120.\n\nPutting this together using the format provided:\n\n```python\n# Calculation using the sympy package\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define variables\nneighbors_contribution = 300\nonline_fund = 1200\nfriends_contribution = 120\n\n# Total collected before the lawyer's donation\ntotal_before_lawyer = neighbors_contribution + online_fund\n\n# Lawyer's contribution calculation\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * total_before_lawyer\n\n# Print lawyer's contribution\nprint(\"Walter's lawyer is going to contribute:\")\nprint(lawyer_contribution)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Check each step for correctness:\n   - Neighbors and online fund: Correctly calculated as \\(300 + 1200 = 1500\\).\n   - Lawyer's contribution: \\(3 \\times 1500 = 4500\\). This is verified by multiplying correctly.\n\n2. Confirm additional logic or conditions:\n   - The additional $120 donated by a friend does not change the lawyer's contribution since it was specified separately. This calculation matches the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \\(\\boxed{4500}\\)."
