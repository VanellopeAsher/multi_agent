Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \n48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. However, before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's employ a step-by-step process involving calculations that could be handled using Python. However, because this problem can be tackled straightforwardly with direct calculations, I will outline the process without coding.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Initial Number of Passengers:**\n   - There are initially 48 passengers on the bus.\n\n2. **First Stop:**\n   - 8 passengers get off the bus.\n   - Remaining passengers after 8 get off: \\( 48 - 8 = 40 \\).\n   - 5 times as many passengers get on: \\( 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\).\n   - Total passengers now: \\( 40 + 40 = 80 \\).\n   - 2 passengers who just got on then decide to get off: \\( 80 - 2 = 78 \\).\n\n3. **Second Stop:**\n   - 21 passengers get off the bus.\n   - Remaining passengers after 21 get off: \\( 78 - 21 = 57 \\).\n   - 3 times fewer passengers get on. This means one-third of passengers who got off gets on:\n     \\[ \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\text{ passengers get on} \\]\n   - Total passengers now: \\( 57 + 7 = 64 \\).\n\nSo, after the second stop, there are 64 passengers on the bus.\n\n```plaintext\nVERIFICATION:\n- Initially 48 passengers.\n- After first stop: 40 get off leaving 40 remaining + 40 get on = 80, then 2 get off = 78.\n- After second stop: 21 get off leaving 57 remaining + 7 get on = 64.\n\nVerification confirms the calculations.\n\nFinal Answer: 64 passengers.\n```\nHence, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \\(\\boxed{64}\\)."
