Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day. He worked for an entire week and saved a total of $110. How much did he spend?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald spent after working for a week and saving a part of his earnings. We can approach this using a simple calculation.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Gerald earns $30 per day.\n- Worked for an entire week (7 days).\n- Saved a total of $110.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week**:\n   - Since Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying the daily wage by the number of days.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 30 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount he spent**:\n   - Let the amount he spent be denoted by \\( S \\).\n   - We know that the amount saved plus the amount spent equals his total earnings.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Amount Saved} + \\text{Amount Spent}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = \\text{Total Earnings} - \\text{Amount Saved}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = 30 * 7  # Gerald's earnings for the week\n\n# Calculate the amount spent\namount_saved = 110\namount_spent = total_earnings - amount_saved\n\n# Output the result\nprint(amount_spent)\n```\n\n**Run the Code** to find the amount spent.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Earnings**:\n   - \\( 30 \\times 7 = 210 \\)\n   - Gerald's total earnings for the week are $210.\n\n2. **Amount Saved and Spent**:\n   - Total Earnings = $210\n   - Amount Saved = $110\n   - \\( \\text{Amount Spent} = 210 - 110 = 100 \\)\n\nThe calculations are accurate based on the logic outlined above.\n\nThe final result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]\n\nGerald spent $100 during the week."
