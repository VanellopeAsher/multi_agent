Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  The alcohol content of cognac is 15% stronger than scotch.  How much does he spend on everything?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts and calculate the total cost step by step. Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\nStep 1: Determine the cost per bottle of scotch.\n- John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600.\n- The cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost of scotch / Number of bottles.\n  \nStep 2: Determine the cost per bottle of cognac.\n- The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of a bottle of scotch.\n  \nStep 3: Determine the number of bottles of cognac and the total cost.\n- John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch, i.e., 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n- Calculate the total cost for the bottles of cognac using the cost per bottle.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total cost John spends on both scotch and cognac.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python and the sympy library to keep everything in exact (non-decimal) form.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch\ntotal_cost_scotch = 600  # Total cost for scotch in dollars\nnum_bottles_scotch = 10  # Number of scotch bottles\ncost_per_bottle_scotch = Rational(total_cost_scotch, num_bottles_scotch)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the cost per bottle of cognac\ncost_per_bottle_cognac = cost_per_bottle_scotch * Rational(3, 2)  # 50% more than scotch\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total cost for cognac\nnum_bottles_cognac = 2 * num_bottles_scotch  # Twice the number of scotch bottles\ntotal_cost_cognac = num_bottles_cognac * cost_per_bottle_cognac\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total cost for everything\ntotal_cost = total_cost_scotch + total_cost_cognac\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow let's evaluate this:\n\n1. **Step 1 and 2**: Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch, and then use it to determine the cost per bottle of cognac.\n   \n2. **Step 3**: Multiply the cost per bottle of cognac by the number of bottles of cognac to get the total cost for cognac.\n\n3. **Step 4**: Add the total cost of scotch and cognac to get the final answer.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. The cost per bottle of scotch is \\(\\frac{600}{10} = 60\\).\n\n2. The cost per bottle of cognac is \\(60 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 90\\).\n\n3. Total cost for 20 bottles of cognac is \\(20 \\times 90 = 1800\\).\n\n4. Total cost spent is \\(600 + 1800 = 2400\\).\n\nJohn spends a total of \\(\\boxed{2400}\\) dollars on everything."
