Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a reasoning-based solution with algebra. Let's define the variables and set up the equations.\n\n### Key Idea and Definition of Variables\n\nLet's define the following:\n- \\( E \\) as Emil's current age.\n- \\( D \\) as his dad's current age.\n- \\( B \\) as his brother's current age.\n\nGiven:\n- Emil is currently 21 years old, so \\( E = 21 \\).\n- Emil is 26 in 5 years (21 + 5).\n\nIn 5 years:\n- Emil's age = 26\n- Dad's age \\( D + 5 \\)\n- Brother's age \\( B + 5 \\)\n\nThe problem states:\n1. When Emil is 26, he will be half the age of his dad:\n   \\[\n   26 = \\frac{1}{2}(D + 5)\n   \\]\n\n2. When Emil is 26, he will be twice the age of his brother:\n   \\[\n   26 = 2(B + 5)\n   \\]\n\n### Solving the Equations\n\nLet's solve these equations step by step:\n\n**Equation 1:**  \n\\[ \n26 = \\frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\\[ \n52 = D + 5 \n\\]\nThus, Emil's dad's current age:\n\\[ \nD = 52 - 5 = 47 \n\\]\n\n**Equation 2:**  \n\\[ \n26 = 2(B + 5) \n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ \n13 = B + 5 \n\\]\nThus, Emil's brother's current age:\n\\[ \nB = 13 - 5 = 8 \n\\]\n\n### Sum of Dad's and Brother's Ages Now\n\nLet's calculate the sum of their ages:\n\\[\nD + B = 47 + 8 = 55\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \\(\\boxed{55}\\).\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Emil's Dad in 5 years:** \n   - Current age: 47\n   - Age in 5 years: \\(47 + 5 = 52\\)\n   - Half of 52 is indeed 26, aligning with the given conditions.\n\n2. **Emil's Brother in 5 years:**\n   - Current age: 8\n   - Age in 5 years: \\(8 + 5 = 13\\)\n   - Double Emil's brother's age (13) is indeed 26, aligning with the given conditions.\n\nEach step and calculation matches the conditions specified in the problem. The solution is verified as correct. Therefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{55}\\)."
