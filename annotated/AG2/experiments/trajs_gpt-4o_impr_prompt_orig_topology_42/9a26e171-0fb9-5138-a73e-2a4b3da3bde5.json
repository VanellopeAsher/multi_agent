Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this number represents one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer at home, how many students are there at that grade level?"

We'll define and use variables to represent the information given.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of students at that grade level.\n   - We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, meaning \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\) have a desktop.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{4}x \\) do not have a desktop computer.\n\n2. **Relate the Given Information:**\n   - We know 20 students do not have desktop computers. According to the problem, this number represents one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop.\n   - Let \\( y \\) represent the number of students without a desktop or a laptop. Hence, \\( \\frac{1}{3}y = 20 \\).\n\n3. **Set Up and Solve the Equations:**\n   - From \\( \\frac{1}{4}x = y \\).\n   - From \\( y = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for Total Students \\( x \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( y = 60 \\) into the equation \\( \\frac{1}{4}x = y \\).\n   - Thus, \\( \\frac{1}{4}x = 60 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\( x \\):**\n   - Multiply both sides by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 4 \\times 60 = 240\n   \\]\n\nLet's express the calculations using Python to verify and automate the process using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Given condition: 1/4 of x = 60\nequation = Eq(x / 4, 60)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Total number of students:\", solution[0])\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Verify Conditions:**\n   - One-fourth of 240 is 60, which equals the number of students not having desktops.\n   - 60 students do not have either a desktop or laptop, and 20 of them matches one-third of this group.\n\n2. **Confirm Result:**\n   - Both the calculated value and verification check confirm that the solution is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students is \\(\\boxed{240}\\)."
