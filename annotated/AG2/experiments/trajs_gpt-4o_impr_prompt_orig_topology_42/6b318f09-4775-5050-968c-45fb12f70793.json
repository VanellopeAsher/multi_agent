      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMartha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 12 families with 6 people and 15 families with 4 people. 16 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people invited to Martha's Christmas party, then subtract those who couldn't attend due to illness and prior commitments.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Invited People:**\n   - There are 12 families with 6 people each.\n   - There are 15 families with 4 people each.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Absentees:**\n   - 16 people couldn't come due to illness.\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments.\n\n3. **Calculate the Actual Number of Attendees:**\n   - Subtract the total number of absentees from the total invited people.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the number of people invited\nfamilies_with_six = 12\npeople_per_family_six = 6\n\nfamilies_with_four = 15\npeople_per_family_four = 4\n\ntotal_people_invited = (families_with_six * people_per_family_six) + (families_with_four * people_per_family_four)\n\n# Calculate the number of people who could not come\npeople_ill = 16\npeople_with_commitments = Rational(1, 4) * people_ill\n\ntotal_couldnt_come = people_ill + people_with_commitments\n\n# Calculate the number of people who show up\npeople_show_up = total_people_invited - total_couldnt_come\n\n# Print the result\nprint(people_show_up)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- We compute the total number of invitees by multiplying the number of families by the number of people per family and summing these products.\n- We calculate the total number of people absent due to illness and commitments.\n- Finally, we subtract the total absentees from the total invited to find how many attendees actually show up.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nTotal invited = \\( (12 \\times 6) + (15 \\times 4) = 72 + 60 = 132 \\)\n\nPeople absent due to illness = 16\n\nPeople absent due to previous commitments = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4 \\)\n\nTotal absentee = 16 + 4 = 20\n\nPeople who showed up = 132 - 20 = 112\n\nThis verification confirms that the calculation is correct. Therefore, the final number of attendees is 112.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]"
