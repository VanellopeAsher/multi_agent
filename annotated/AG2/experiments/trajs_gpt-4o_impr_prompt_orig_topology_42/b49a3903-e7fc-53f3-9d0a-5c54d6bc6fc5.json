Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first break down the details:\n\n**Given:**\n- Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row.\n- Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.\n- Jackson can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row.\n- Jackson buys 36 red tulips, 24 blue tulips, and 30 yellow tulips.\n- He places a row of yellow tulips between each row of red and blue tulips.\n\n**Objective:**\n- Calculate the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant.\n\n**Solution Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate Rows for Red Tulips:**\n   - \\( \\text{Total red rows} = \\frac{\\text{Total red tulips}}{\\text{Tulips per row}}\\)\n   - \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\text{ rows of red tulips}\\)\n\n2. **Calculate Rows for Blue Tulips:**\n   - \\( \\text{Total blue rows} = \\frac{\\text{Total blue tulips}}{\\text{Tulips per row}}\\)\n   - \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\text{ rows of blue tulips}\\)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Yellow Rows Needed:**\n   - If we have a different row of yellow tulips between each row of red and blue tulips, and we assume alternating rows, then:\n     - Between the 6 red rows, there are 5 gaps where yellow rows can be placed before the blue row begins.\n     - If yellow rows are also placed after the red rows and between the blue rows, then we have:\n     - Total yellow gaps = Redâˆ’1 + 1 blue start = 6 - 1 + 1 = 6\n   - Limit by the number of yellow tulips: \\( \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\text{ yellow rows possible}\\)\n\n4. **Total Number of Rows to Plant:**\n   - Sum up the rows:\n     - Red rows: 6\n     - Blue rows: 3\n     - Yellow rows: 6\n\nThe total number of rows Jackson will plant is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ red rows} + 6 \\text{ yellow rows} + 3 \\text{ blue rows} = 15 \\text{ rows}\n\\]\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\nyellow_tulips = 30\n\n# Tulips per row\nred_per_row = 6\nblue_per_row = 8\nyellow_per_row = 5\n\n# Calculate rows\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_per_row\nyellow_rows = yellow_tulips // yellow_per_row\n\ntotal_rows = red_rows + yellow_rows + blue_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculating the rows for each color matches our expectations and understanding of the problem.\n2. The calculations respect the purchase constraints for tulips: each batch fits seamlessly into the available number of rows such as 36/6 = 6.\n3. This confirms the process and correctness since:\n   - Red rows: 6\n   - Blue rows: 3\n   - Yellow rows: interstitial and correctly counted at 6\n   \nThus, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is indeed 15.\n\n\\(\\boxed{15}\\)"
