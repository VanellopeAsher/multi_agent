Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the rate of work done by individuals and the total amount of work required. Let's break this down systematically.\n\n### Key Idea:\nThe problem involves calculating the work done collectively by a group of people, given the rate at which a single person works.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Work Rate of a Single Individual:**\n   - A single individual can paint half a house in 5 days.\n   - Therefore, in 5 days, 1 individual paints 0.5 houses.\n   - Hence, in 1 day, the same individual can paint \\( \\frac{0.5}{5} = \\frac{1}{10} \\) of a house.\n\n2. **Calculate the Work Rate of 5 Individuals:**\n   - If 1 individual paints \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of a house per day, then 5 individuals will paint \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a house per day.\n\n3. **Determine the Time Taken by 5 Individuals to Paint 1 House:**\n   - To paint 1 entire house, the 5 individuals, who paint \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a house per day, would need \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \\) days.\n\n4. **Convert Days to Hours:**\n   - If we assume a working day consists of 8 hours, then 2 days is equivalent to \\( 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\) hours.\n\n### Calculation Using Python:\n\nWe'll use Python to verify these calculations. The calculation is straightforward, and no additional libraries are required here.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the amount of work one person does per day\nwork_per_day_per_person = 0.5 / 5  # house parts per day\n\n# Calculate the amount of work done by 5 people per day\nwork_per_day_with_5_people = 5 * work_per_day_per_person\n\n# Calculate the number of days required for 5 people to paint the whole house\ndays_to_paint_full_house = 1 / work_per_day_with_5_people\n\n# Convert days to hours (assuming 8-hour workdays)\nhours_to_paint_full_house = days_to_paint_full_house * 8\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The team of 5 individuals will take {hours_to_paint_full_house} hours to paint the entire house.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. Each individual paints \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) house per day.\n2. Total work for 5 people per day = \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) house.\n3. Total time to paint 1 house = \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \\) days.\n4. Converting to hours: 2 days × 8 hours/day = 16 hours.\n\nEvery step checks out and confirms that the time required is correctly calculated.\n\nThus, the number of hours required for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house is \\(\\boxed{16}\\)."
