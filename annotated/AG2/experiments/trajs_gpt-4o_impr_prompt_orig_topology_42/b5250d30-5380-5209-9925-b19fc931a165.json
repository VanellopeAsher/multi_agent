Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery Saturday, Jill along with her companions view 4 films and on Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays. If this routine is followed every weekend, what is the total number of films they can view in a span of 4 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of films watched over 4 weeks, given Jill's weekend film-watching routine. \n\nKey Idea:\n- Calculate the number of films watched per weekend and then multiply by the number of weeks.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. Every Saturday, Jill and her companions watch 4 films.\n2. On Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays, which is \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\) films.\n\n**Total films watched per weekend:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Films on Saturday} + \\text{Films on Sunday} = 4 + 2 = 6 \\text{ films per weekend} \\]\n\n**Total films watched in 4 weeks:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Total films in 4 weeks} = 6 \\text{ films/weekend} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ films} \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation with Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Films watched on Saturday and Sunday\nfilms_saturday = 4\nfilms_sunday = films_saturday / 2\n\n# Total films watched per weekend\nfilms_per_weekend = films_saturday + films_sunday\n\n# Total films for 4 weeks\ntotal_films = films_per_weekend * 4\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(total_films)\n```\n\nThis calculation confirms they watch 24 films in 4 weeks.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Films each Saturday: 4\n- Films each Sunday: 2 (half of Saturday)\n- Total per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6\n- For 4 weeks: 6 films/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 films\n\nEverything matches, ensuring the calculation is consistent and accurate.\n\n\\(\\boxed{24}\\)"
