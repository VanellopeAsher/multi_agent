Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

      "content": "To find the forgotten score, let's use the concept of mean (average) in math. The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers.\n\nLet's define the problem:\n\n1. Sally has taken 9 quizzes, but we only know 8 scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, and 70.\n2. We represent the forgotten score as \\( x \\).\n3. The mean of all 9 scores is 70.\n\nLet's solve the problem using Python:\n\n### Key Idea\n\nTo find the forgotten score \\( x \\), we set up the equation based on the definition of the mean:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + x}{9} = 70\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for \\( x \\).\n\n### Python Solution\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the forgotten score as a symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Known scores\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# Calculate the equation for the mean\ntotal_scores = sum(scores) + x\nmean_equation = Eq(total_scores / 9, 70)\n\n# Solve for the forgotten score\nforgotten_score = solve(mean_equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f\"The forgotten score is: {forgotten_score}\")\n```\n\n### Execution and Result\n\nBy running the code, we get the value of the forgotten score. Let's check it step by step using the VERIFICATION section.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the sum of the known scores:** \\( 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570 \\).\n\n2. **Setup the equation with the unknown score \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{570 + x}{9} = 70\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply both sides by 9 to clear the fraction:**\n   \\[\n   570 + x = 630\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract 570 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 630 - 570 = 60\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the forgotten score is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{60}\\)"
