      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows. She has 6 presents for her family members, 4 presents for her buddies, and 2 presents for her educators. She possesses 144 inches of ribbon for this task. What is the length in inches of ribbon that she can allocate for each present's bow?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the length of ribbon Monica can allocate for each present's bow. Let's break the problem down into manageable steps.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Presents**\n\nMonica has:\n- 6 presents for her family members\n- 4 presents for her buddies\n- 2 presents for her educators\n\nLet's sum these to get the total number of presents.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ribbon Length Per Present**\n\nMonica has 144 inches of ribbon available. We'll divide this total ribbon length by the total number of presents to find out how much ribbon can be allocated per present.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python and its `sympy` library to keep the output in a fraction form.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of presents\ntotal_presents = 6 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total ribbon available\ntotal_ribbon = 144  # in inches\n\n# Ribbon length per present\nribbon_per_present = Rational(total_ribbon, total_presents)\n\n# Display result\nprint(\"Length of ribbon per present:\", ribbon_per_present)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate the total number of presents:\n   \\[\n   6 + 4 + 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the ribbon per present:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ribbon per present} = \\frac{144}{12} = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that each present can have 12 inches of ribbon allocated for its bow.\n\nTherefore, the length in inches of ribbon Monica can allocate for each present's bow is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
