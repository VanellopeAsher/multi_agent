Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how far Polly can stand outside of the 10,000 feet range of the dragon's flames while still being able to hit the dragon with her javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Polly's normal throwing distance for the javelin is 4,000 feet.\n2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance triples, becoming \\(3 \\times 4000 = 12,000\\) feet.\n\nNow, to find how far outside the dragon's 10,000 feet flame reach Polly can stand, we simply calculate:\n\n- Polly's maximum throwing distance with the gemstone is 12,000 feet.\n- The dragon's reach is 10,000 feet.\n\nTherefore, Polly can stand \\(12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000\\) feet outside the flame's reach and still hit the dragon.\n\nLet's illustrate this calculation using Python and verify our result.\n\n```python\n# Key distances\nnormal_throwing_distance = 4000  # Polly's normal javelin throw distance in feet\nmultiplier_with_gemstone = 3\ndragon_flame_reach = 10000  # Dragon's flame reach in feet\n\n# Calculate the throwing distance with the gemstone\nthrowing_distance_with_gemstone = normal_throwing_distance * multiplier_with_gemstone\n\n# Calculate the safe distance outside the flame's reach\nsafe_distance_outside_flames = throwing_distance_with_gemstone - dragon_flame_reach\n\nprint(safe_distance_outside_flames)  # Output the result\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. The normal throwing distance is correctly stated as 4,000 feet.\n2. The multiplication factor with the gemstone is correctly used: \\(3 \\times 4000 = 12,000\\).\n3. The dragon's flame reach is correctly referenced as 10,000 feet.\n4. Calculating \\(12,000 - 10,000\\), we correctly find the distance Polly can stand outside the flame's reach.\n5. The mathematical operations are checked for their correctness, and they align with the problem's logic.\n\nThus, confirming the calculations, Polly can stand \\( \\boxed{2000} \\) feet outside the dragon's flames while still being able to hit the dragon with the javelin."
