Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's examine the details provided step-by-step and determine how many lines Sean needs to memorize in total.\n\n1. **Lines in the Solo Song:**\n   - The solo song has 54 lines. Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the song.\n\n2. **Lines in the First Scene:**\n   - The first scene has twice as many lines as the solo song. \n   - Therefore, the first scene has \\( 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\) lines.\n   - Sean is responsible for a third of these lines, so he needs to memorize \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36 \\) lines in the first scene.\n\n3. **Lines in the Second Scene:**\n   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.\n   - Therefore, the second scene has \\( 54 + 6 = 60 \\) lines.\n   - Four-fifths of these are Sean's lines, so he initially needs to memorize \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\) lines.\n   - However, due to another actor being absent, Sean has to memorize an additional 15 lines in this scene.\n\n4. **Total Lines to be Memorized:**\n   - Calculate the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize by adding up all the lines from the solo song, first scene, and all lines from the second scene that he is responsible for.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to compute the total.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize\n\n# Solo song\nsolo_song_lines = 54\n\n# First scene\nfirst_scene_lines = 2 * solo_song_lines\nfirst_scene_memorized = first_scene_lines / 3\n\n# Second scene\nsecond_scene_lines = solo_song_lines + 6\nsecond_scene_memorized_initially = (4 / 5) * second_scene_lines\nadditional_lines_due_to_absence = 15\nsecond_scene_memorized = second_scene_memorized_initially + additional_lines_due_to_absence\n\n# Total lines memorized\ntotal_memorized_lines = solo_song_lines + first_scene_memorized + second_scene_memorized\n\nprint(total_memorized_lines)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify each step to ensure the correctness:\n\n- **Solo Song:** 54 lines to memorize — correct.\n- **First Scene:** \n  - Total lines: \\( 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\).\n  - Sean needs to memorize \\( 108 \\div 3 = 36 \\) lines — correct.\n- **Second Scene:** \n  - Total lines: \\( 54 + 6 = 60 \\).\n  - Initially responsible for \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\) lines.\n  - Additionally, 15 lines due to absence, giving \\( 48 + 15 = 63 \\) lines — correct.\n\nNow, calculate Sean's total memorized lines:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 54 + 36 + 63 = 153 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \\( \\boxed{153} \\)."
