Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has and the number of students who received the cards after Miss Maria kept some for herself. Below is the structured reasoning and solution approach:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate Total Number of Basketball Cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, each containing 25 cards.\n   - Total basketball cards \\(= 6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Number of Baseball Cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has 5 boxes of baseball cards, each containing 40 cards.\n   - Total baseball cards \\(= 5 \\times 40 = 200\\).\n\n3. **Calculate Overall Total Number of Cards:**\n   - Total cards = Total basketball cards + Total baseball cards\n   - Total cards \\(= 150 + 200 = 350\\).\n\n4. **Cards Miss Maria Kept:**\n   - Miss Maria kept 50 cards.\n\n5. **Calculate Cards Given Away:**\n   - Cards given to students = Total cards - Cards Miss Maria kept\n   - Cards given to students \\(= 350 - 50 = 300\\).\n\n6. **Calculate Number of Students:**\n   - Each student gets 10 cards.\n   - Number of students = Cards given to students รท Cards per student\n   - Number of students \\(= \\frac{300}{10} = 30\\).\n\nNow, let's implement the solution using Python:\n\n```python\n# your code\ntotal_basketball_cards = 6 * 25\ntotal_baseball_cards = 5 * 40\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards\ncards_kept_by_maria = 50\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept_by_maria\ncards_per_student = 10\nnumber_of_students = cards_given_to_students // cards_per_student\n\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Checked Total Basketball Cards Calculation: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n2. Checked Total Baseball Cards Calculation: \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\).\n3. Verified Overall Total Card Calculation: \\(150 + 200 = 350\\).\n4. Verified Calculation for Cards Given to Students: \\(350 - 50 = 300\\).\n5. Confirmed Number of Students Calculation: \\(\\frac{300}{10} = 30\\).\n\nBoth the computation and logic have been thoroughly verified.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{30}\\)."
