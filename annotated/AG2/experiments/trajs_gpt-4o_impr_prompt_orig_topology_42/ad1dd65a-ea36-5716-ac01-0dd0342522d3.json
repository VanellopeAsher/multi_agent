Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAn electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each and gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. If the seller also bought a tablet for $330 and a pair of headphones for $137, how much will the seller give back in change after deducting the cost of the phones, the tablet, and the headphones?"

Calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the tablet.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the headphones.\n4. Sum these costs to get the total spending.\n5. Subtract the total spending from the amount given to the seller ($4000) to determine the change.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using simple arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the phones\nphone_price = 700\nnumber_of_phones = 5\ntotal_cost_phones = phone_price * number_of_phones\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the cost of the tablet\ntablet_price = 330\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the cost of the headphones\nheadphones_price = 137\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total spending\ntotal_spending = total_cost_phones + tablet_price + headphones_price\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the change\namount_given = 4000\nchange = amount_given - total_spending\n\n# Print the result in a friendly format\nprint(\"The change to be given back is:\", change)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the change that the seller should receive back."

Let's go through the solution for the verification step-by-step to ensure everything was computed correctly.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Total Cost of Phones:**\n   - Price per phone = $700\n   - Number of phones = 5\n   - Total cost for phones = \\( 700 \\times 5 = 3500 \\)\n\n2. **Cost of Tablet:**\n   - Tablet price = $330\n\n3. **Cost of Headphones:**\n   - Headphones price = $137\n\n4. **Total Spending:**\n   - Total cost for all items = \\( 3500 + 330 + 137 = 3967 \\)\n\n5. **Calculate Change:**\n   - Amount given = $4000\n   - Change = \\( 4000 - 3967 = 33 \\)\n\nThe verification confirms that the change to be given back should indeed be $33. \n\nThus, the correct and verified result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]"
