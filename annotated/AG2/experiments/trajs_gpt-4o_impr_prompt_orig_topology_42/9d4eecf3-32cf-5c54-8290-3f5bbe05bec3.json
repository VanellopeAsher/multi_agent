Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries. If Robert has 3000 cherries, and has 1000 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, I'll employ a Case 3: Step-by-Step Process approach.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information\n\n1. Robert has 3000 cherries.\n2. Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard.\n\nFrom this information, we can set up the following relationship:\n- Robert = Richard + 1000\n- Robert = 3000\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Richard's Cherries\n\nTo find out how many cherries Richard has, we use the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Richard} = \\text{Robert} - 1000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Richard} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Jerry's Cherries\n\nAll three, Richard, Jerry, and Robert together have 6000 cherries. Using the information we've gathered, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Richard} + \\text{Jerry} + \\text{Robert} = 6000 \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ 2000 + \\text{Jerry} + 3000 = 6000 \\]\n\nSolving for Jerry:\n\\[ \\text{Jerry} = 6000 - 2000 - 3000 = 1000 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Difference Between Robert's and Jerry's Cherries\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Robert} - \\text{Jerry} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Verify Richard's cherries calculation:\n   - Given Robert has 3000 cherries and 1000 more than Richard. Richard should have 3000 - 1000 = 2000 cherries. (✓)\n\n2. Verify the total cherries calculation:\n   - Robert (3000) + Richard (2000) + Jerry (calculated 1000) = Total 6000 cherries. (✓)\n\n3. Verify the difference between Robert and Jerry's cherries:\n   - Robert = 3000, Jerry = 1000; Difference = 3000 - 1000 = 2000 cherries. (✓)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{2000}\\)."
