Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will compute the total time Frankie spent watching TV by adding the time spent each day. We will represent each time duration in hours and then sum them up.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Monday and Tuesday**:\n   - Each day, Frankie watched 1 hour of TV.\n   - Total time for Monday and Tuesday: \\(1 \\, \\text{hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{days} = 2 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\n2. **Wednesday**:\n   - Frankie watched three 30-minute episodes.\n   - Total time for Wednesday: \\(3 \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 1.5 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\n3. **Thursday**:\n   - Frankie watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.\n   - Total time for Thursday: \\(1 \\, \\text{hour} + 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 1.5 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\n4. **Friday**:\n   - Frankie watched two one-hour episodes.\n   - Total time for Friday: \\(2 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\nNow, let's add all the times together to get the total hours Frankie watched TV during the week:\n\n\\[\n2 \\, \\text{hours (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \\, \\text{hours (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \\, \\text{hours (Thursday)} + 2 \\, \\text{hours (Friday)}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this sum using Python for accuracy:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of total hours\ntotal_hours = 2 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will output the total number of hours Frankie spent watching TV:\n\n```plaintext\n7.0\n```\n\nThus, the total hours Frankie spent watching TV during the week is \\(\\boxed{7}\\). Let's proceed to the verification step to ensure each calculation matches the problem statement.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Monday and Tuesday**: We have calculated 1 hour for each day, which indeed adds up to 2 hours.\n2. **Wednesday**: Watching 3 episodes of 30 minutes each translates to 1.5 hours.\n3. **Thursday**: 1 hour plus a 30-minute show totals 1.5 hours.\n4. **Friday**: Two 1-hour episodes clearly add up to 2 hours.\n\nAdding these verified calculations gives:\n\n\\[ \n2 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \n\\]\n\nEverything checks out, so the total hours Frankie watched TV is correctly \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."

We will conceptualize the process Frankie uses to track his weekly TV time in a real-world context.\n\n### Illustrative Scenario\n\nImagine Frankie is keeping a diary to record how much TV he watches every evening after his homework. Each day has its own story:\n\n- **Monday and Tuesday:** These are Frankie's favorite show nights. Each evening, he dedicates exactly 1 hour to immerse himself in an episode. Over these two days, he logs 2 hours in total into his weekly diary.\n\n- **Wednesday:** Frankie decides to switch up his viewing with multiple shorter shows. He watches three 30-minute episodes which equate to watching for 1.5 hours. He writes down, \"Watched three fun short episodes, keeping my total today at 90 minutes.\"\n\n- **Thursday:** With extra free time from finishing his homework early, Frankie indulges in an episode marathon. He watches a full hour of episodes, plus an additional short 30-minute segment, summing up to another 1.5 hours.\n\n- **Friday:** Anticipating a relaxed weekend, Frankie plans for a double feature, consuming two full one-hour episodes, thus spending another 2 hours on TV.\n\n### Weekly Total Consolidation\n\nAfter reflecting on each day's contribution to his watching habits, Frankie turns to sum it all up:\n\n1. Monday and Tuesday offer 2 hours together.\n2. Wednesday's eclectic mix contributes an additional 1.5 hours.\n3. Thursday's early start gives way to another 1.5 hours of content.\n4. Finally, Friday's movie night-like experience clocks in at 2 hours.\n\nInstead of narrating the total calculation directly, envision that Frankie curates all his daily entries into a neat summary: \"This week, I've devoted 7 hours to my favorite pastime, TV time!\".\n\nThis wholesome account of his weekly TV tracking results in:\n\n\\(\\boxed{7}\\)\n\nIf you have further queries or need additional assistance, feel free to mention!"
