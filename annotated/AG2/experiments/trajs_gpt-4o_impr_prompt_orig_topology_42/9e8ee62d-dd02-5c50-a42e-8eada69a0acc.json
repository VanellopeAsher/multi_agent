Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another inches in the third week and the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inces tall. How many inches did the beanstalk grow in the third week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of growth the beanstalk experienced in the third week.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Initial Height After the First Week:**\n   - After the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.\n\n2. **Growth During the Second Week:**\n   - In the second week, the beanstalk doubles in height. \n   - Therefore, at the end of the second week, the beanstalk is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches tall.\n\n3. **Height After the Third Week:**\n   - We are given that after the third week, the beanstalk is 10 inches tall.\n\n4. **Determine Growth in the Third Week:**\n   - The height at the end of the second week is 6 inches, and the height at the end of the third week is 10 inches.\n   - Therefore, the growth during the third week is the difference between these two heights:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Growth in third week} = 10 - 6 = 4 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python using the specified format:\n\n```python\n# Calculate growth in third week\ninitial_height = 3  # height after the first week\nheight_after_second_week = initial_height * 2\nfinal_height = 10\ngrowth_third_week = final_height - height_after_second_week\nprint(growth_third_week)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Initial Verification:**\n   - The initial height after the first week is given correctly as 3 inches.\n   - It doubles to 6 inches after the second week, which correctly follows the problem conditions.\n   - The final height is correctly provided as 10 inches.\n\n2. **Calculation Verification:**\n   - By subtracting the height at the end of the second week (6 inches) from the height at the end of the third week (10 inches), we accurately calculate the growth of 4 inches in the third week.\n\nI have verified all calculations step-by-step and ensured they align with the problem statement.\n\nThe beanstalk grew \\(\\boxed{4}\\) inches in the third week."
