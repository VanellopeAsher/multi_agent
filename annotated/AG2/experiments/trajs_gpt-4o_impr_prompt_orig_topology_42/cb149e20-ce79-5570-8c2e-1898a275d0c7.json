      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.

So, she gives \\( \\frac{90}{2} = 45 \\) dollars.\n3. **Total Money Jayden Has:** \n\n   Jayden's money from selling pictures plus Ava's contribution is: \n   \\[\n   70 + 45 = 115\n   \\]\n\n4. **Additional Amount Needed:** Jayden still needs $85.\n\nNow, to find the **total cost of the camera**, we add the money that Jayden currently has to the additional amount he still needs.\n\n**Calculation for Total Camera Cost:**\n\nThe total camera cost \\( C \\) is given by:\n\\[ \nC = \\text{Total Money Jayden Has} + \\text{Additional Amount Needed} \n\\]\n\\[ \nC = 115 + 85 \n\\]\n\\[ \nC = 200 \n\\]\n\nNow, we'll use Python to compute this, adhering to the output formatting requirements and code formatting convention:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of total camera cost\n# Jayden's initial money\nmoney_from_pictures = 70\n# Ava's half allowance\nava_contribution = 90 / 2\n# Additional money needed\nadditional_needed = 85\n# Total money Jayden has\ntotal_money_jayden_has = money_from_pictures + ava_contribution\n# Total camera cost\ncamera_cost = total_money_jayden_has + additional_needed\n\n# Printing the total camera cost\nprint(camera_cost)\n```\n\nOnce we run this code, it should print the total camera cost, which is $200.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet's verify each step:\n\n- Jayden starts with $70.\n- Ava gives $45, bringing the total to $115.\n- Jayden needs $85 more, confirming that the total cost of the camera is indeed $115 (current money) + $85 (needed) = $200.\n\nThus, the camera costs \\(\\boxed{200}\\) dollars."
