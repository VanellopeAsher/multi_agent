Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month.

      "content": "To determine Mark's initial weight before he became ill, we need to account for both the weight he lost during his illness and the weight he regained during recovery.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. **Illness Period:**  \n   Mark was unwell for 3 months, and during each month, he lost 10 pounds.  \n   The total weight loss during this period = \\(3 \\text{ months} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds/month} = 30\\) pounds.\n\n2. **Recovery Period:**  \n   In the subsequent months, Mark managed to regain weight. He regained 5 pounds per month over 2 months.  \n   The total weight regained during this period = \\(2 \\text{ months} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds/month} = 10\\) pounds.\n\n3. **Final Weight Assessment:**  \n   We know that after his recovery, Mark's weight was 70 pounds. Hence, his weight just after the illness and before recovering weight was:  \n   \\(70 \\text{ pounds} + 10 \\text{ pounds (regained)} = 80\\) pounds.\n\n4. **Initial Weight Calculation:**  \n   To find his initial weight before the illness, we need to add back the weight he lost during the illness:  \n   \\(80 \\text{ pounds} + 30 \\text{ pounds (lost)} = 110\\) pounds.\n\nNow, let's express the calculation in Python using the format specified:\n\n```python\n# Using sympy for symbolic mathematics\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Mark's initial weight before falling ill\ninitial_weight = symbols('initial_weight')\n\n# Equation representing the weight changes\n# initial_weight - total_weight_lost + total_weight_regained = final_weight\nequation = Eq(initial_weight - 30 + 10, 70)\n\n# Solve for the initial weight\nsolution = solve(equation, initial_weight)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Mark lost 30 pounds during his illness period.\n2. He regained 10 pounds during his recovery.\n3. His final weight was given as 70 pounds.\n\nThe calculation:  \nInitial weight \\(-\\) \\(30\\) pounds (lost) \\(+\\) \\(10\\) pounds (regained) \\= \\(70\\) pounds.  \nSolving this gives: Initial weight = 110 pounds.\n\nThe verification matches the solution. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{110}\n\\]"
