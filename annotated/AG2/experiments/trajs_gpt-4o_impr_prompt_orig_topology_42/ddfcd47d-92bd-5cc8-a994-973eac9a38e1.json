Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the individual amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have, then find out what each one would have if they shared their total money equally.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Determine Kassidy's money:**\n   - Let \\( A \\) represent Aurelia's money. We know \\( A = 150 \\).\n   - Kassidy's money \\( K \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of Aurelia's money:\n     \\[\n     K = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 150\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Rayna's money:**\n   - Rayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy. Thus, Rayna's money \\( R \\):\n     \\[\n     R = K + 70\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount to be shared:**\n   - Sum the amounts held by Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total} = R + K + A\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine how much each would receive if shared equally:**\n   - Since there are three people, each person would receive:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Equal Share} = \\frac{\\text{Total}}{3}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these steps using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given value\nAurelia_money = 150\n\n# Kassidy's money\nKassidy_money = Rational(2, 3) * Aurelia_money\n\n# Rayna's money\nRayna_money = Kassidy_money + 70\n\n# Total money\ntotal_money = Rayna_money + Kassidy_money + Aurelia_money\n\n# Equal share\nequal_share = total_money / 3\n\n# Using print for the result as required\nprint(f\"Kassidy's Money: {Kassidy_money}\")\nprint(f\"Rayna's Money: {Rayna_money}\")\nprint(f\"Total Money: {total_money}\")\nprint(f\"Equal Share: {equal_share}\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\nLet's verify each step:\n1. **Kassidy's Money:**\n   \\[\n   K = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rayna's Money:**\n   \\[\n   R = 100 + 70 = 170\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Amount:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total} = 170 + 100 + 150 = 420\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equal Share:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Equal Share} = \\frac{420}{3} = 140\n   \\]\n\nAfter verifying each step, it is confirmed that the logic and calculations are correct. The equal share each would receive is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
