Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 80 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?"

      "content": "Let's solve this problem using a step-by-step process.\n\n### Key Idea:\nTo determine how much fence each person gets, we need to split the total amount of fence such that Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the amount of the fence Sam receives.\n   - Because Harry receives 80 feet more than Sam, Harry will receive \\( S + 80 \\).\n\n2. **Total Amount of Fence:**\n   - The total fence is 200 feet, which means:\n   \\[\n   S + (S + 80) = 200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   2S + 80 = 200\n   \\]\n   - Subtract 80 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2S = 120\n   \\]\n   - Divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   S = 60\n   \\]\n\n   This means that Sam receives 60 feet of fence.\n\n### Verification:\n\nTo verify, let's calculate how much fence Harry receives:\n- Since Sam receives 60 feet, Harry should receive:\n  \\[\n  S + 80 = 60 + 80 = 140\n  \\]\n\nNow, check if the total adds up to 200 feet:\n\\[ \n60 + 140 = 200 \n\\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[ \n\\boxed{60} \n\\]\nSam receives 60 feet of the fence."
