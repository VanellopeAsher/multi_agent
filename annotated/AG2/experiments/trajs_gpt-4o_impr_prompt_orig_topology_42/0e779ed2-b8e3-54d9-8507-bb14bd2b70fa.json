Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the ages of the siblings and sum them up. We have:\n\n1. Three sisters who each have an age that is 1.6 times ten.\n2. The age of one brother is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of 20 years.\n3. The older brother's age is twice that of the younger brother.\n\nLet's start by calculating the age of each sibling:\n\n\n\n1. **Age of each sister:**\n\n   Each sister's age is given as 1.6 times ten. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sister's age} = 1.6 \\times 10 = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Age of the younger brother:**\n\n   The younger brother's age is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of 20 years. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Younger brother's age} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 = 12 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Age of the older brother:**\n\n   The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Older brother's age} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings by summing up the individual ages.\n\n```python\n# Calculation of total age of all siblings\n\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10  # Age of each sister\nyounger_brother_age = Rational(3, 5) * 20  # Age of the younger brother\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age  # Age of the older brother\n\n# Total age calculation\ntotal_age = 3 * sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(\"Total age of all siblings:\", total_age)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we will calculate and print the total age of all the siblings.\n\nNow let’s verify and provide the final boxed answer.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Sisters’ Ages:**\n   - Calculate the age of each sister.\n   - Multiply by 3, since there are three sisters.\n   - Each sister's age is 16 years, so their combined age is \\( 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Younger Brother’s Age:**\n   - Correctly calculated as \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of 20, which is 12 years.\n\n3. **Older Brother’s Age:**\n   - Twice the younger brother's, which is \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\).\n\n4. **Sum Total:**\n   - \\( 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 \\).\n\nHence, the total age of all siblings is \\(\\boxed{84}\\)."
