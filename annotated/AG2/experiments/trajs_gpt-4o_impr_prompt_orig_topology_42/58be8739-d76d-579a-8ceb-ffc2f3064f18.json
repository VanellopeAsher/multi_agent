Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing based on the given information. Let's break down the problem and use a step-by-step approach to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Identify the time spent on each activity:**\n   - Boating: 6 hours\n   - Swimming: Half of boating time = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3 \\) hours\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows \\( \\times \\) 2 hours/show = 6 hours\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent on listed activities:**\n   - \\( 6 \\) hours (boating) \\( + 3 \\) hours (swimming) \\( + 6 \\) hours (shows) = 15 hours\n\n3. **Determine the total vacation time (since 30% was for these activities):**\n   - Let total time be \\( T \\).\n   - 30% of total time is spent on these activities: \\( 0.3T = 15 \\) hours\n   - Solve for \\( T \\):\n\n   \\[\n   0.3T = 15\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{15}{0.3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate total vacation time using Python to ensure accuracy:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define a symbol for the total time\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Build the equation\nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, 15)\n\n# Solve the equation for T\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\nprint(\"Total vacation time:\", total_time)\n```\n\n5. **Find the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing time = Total vacation time - Time spent on mentioned activities\n   - \\( T - 15 \\) hours\n\n6. **Calculate sightseeing time in Python:**\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sightseeing time\nsightseeing_time = total_time - 15\n\nprint(\"Time spent sightseeing:\", sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n### Solution:\n\nAfter performing these calculations, use the Python code to calculate the values, which should give you:\n\n- Total vacation time \\( T = 50 \\) hours\n- Time spent sightseeing \\( = 50 - 15 = 35 \\) hours\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- Verify that 30% of 50 hours is indeed 15 hours by calculating \\( 0.3 \\times 50 \\).\n- Confirm the calculated sightseeing time results by re-evaluating the whole calculation process step-by-step with the provided code.\n\nGiven these steps and the final calculation, John spent sight-seeing for:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{35}\n\\] hours."
