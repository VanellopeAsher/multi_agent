Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.

      "content": "To determine how many guests are necessary for the costs of the two venues to be equal, we can set up an equation based on the given cost structures.\n\n**Concept**: \nLet's define the variables and equations representing the cost of each venue.\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of guests attending the party.\n- Cost for Venue 1: The flat venue fee is $2000. Additionally, Mark has to pay $50 per guest for food. So, the cost for Venue 1 is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost for Venue 1} = 2000 + 50n\n  \\]\n\n- Cost for Venue 2: The venue charges $250 per guest including food. So, the cost for Venue 2 is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost for Venue 2} = 250n\n  \\]\n\n**Goal**: We need to find the value of \\( n \\) where the costs for both venues are equal:\n\\[ \n2000 + 50n = 250n\n\\]\n\n**Solution**: Solve for \\( n \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Define the equation for equal costs\nequation = Eq(2000 + 50 * n, 250 * n)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, n)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\n**Verification**:\n1. Set up the equation correctly: \\( 2000 + 50n = 250n \\).\n2. Subtract \\( 50n \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 250n - 50n\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 200n\n   \\]\n4. Divide both sides by 200:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{2000}{200} = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \\( \\bbox{[10]} \\)."
