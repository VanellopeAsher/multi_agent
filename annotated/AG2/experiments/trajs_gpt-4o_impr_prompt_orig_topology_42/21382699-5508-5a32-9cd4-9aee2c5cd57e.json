Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use a mix of algebra and reasoning. We'll follow a structured approach, calculating both individuals' ages based on the given ratios and constraints.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have two people, Darrell and Allen.\n   - Their ages are in the ratio of \\(7:11\\).\n   - The sum of their ages is 162.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - Let's denote Darrell's age as \\(7x\\) and Allen's age as \\(11x\\).\n   - According to the given information, we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     7x + 11x = 162\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this, we get:\n     \\[\n     18x = 162\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 18 to find \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{162}{18}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Ages:**\n   - Substitute \\(x\\) back into the expressions for the ages:\n     \\[\n     x = 9\n     \\]\n   - Darrell's age is \\(7x = 7 \\times 9 = 63\\).\n   - Allen's age is \\(11x = 11 \\times 9 = 99\\).\n\n5. **Find Allen's Age 10 Years from Now:**\n   - Allen's current age is 99.\n   - In 10 years, Allen will be \\(99 + 10 = 109\\).\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python to verify the values:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the age ratio and total age\nequation = Eq(7 * x + 11 * x, 162)\n\n# Solve for x\nx_value = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate Darrell's and Allen's current age\ndarrell_age = 7 * x_value\nallen_age = 11 * x_value\n\n# Calculate Allen's age in 10 years\nallen_age_in_10_years = allen_age + 10\n\n# Print the result\nprint(allen_age_in_10_years)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- **Equation Check:** \\(18x = 162 \\rightarrow x = 9\\). Correctly solved for \\(x\\).\n- **Ages Check:** \n  - \\(7x = 63\\) for Darrell, \n  - \\(11x = 99\\) for Allen.\n- **Sum of Ages Verification:** \\(63 + 99 = 162\\), which matches the given total.\n- **Final Check for Allen's Future Age:** \\(99 + 10 = 109\\).\n\nFinal result: Allen's age 10 years from now is \\( \\boxed{109} \\)."
