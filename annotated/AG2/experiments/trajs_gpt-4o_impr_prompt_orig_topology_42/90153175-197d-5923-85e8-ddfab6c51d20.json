Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed and then convert that number into dozens.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Number of Days in 12 Weeks**:\n   To find the number of days Claire will eat omelets for 12 weeks, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of days in a week:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Days} = 12 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs**:\n   Claire uses 3 eggs for her omelet each day. Therefore, the total number of eggs used over the 12 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total eggs} = \\text{Days} \\times 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert Eggs to Dozens**:\n   Since a dozen consists of 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the total number of dozens:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dozens} = \\frac{\\text{Total eggs}}{12}\n   \\]\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# number of weeks\nweeks = 12\n\n# days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# eggs per day\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# calculate number of days\ndays = weeks * days_in_week\n\n# total number of eggs\ntotal_eggs = days * eggs_per_day\n\n# convert to dozens\ndozens = total_eggs / 12\n\n# print the result\nprint(dozens)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to get the answer:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate Days**:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 7 = 84 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Eggs**:\n   \\[\n   84 \\times 3 = 252 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert Eggs to Dozens**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252}{12} = 21 \\text{ dozens}\n   \\]\n\nThese calculations match our expectations, so Claire will consume:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\] \n\ndozens of eggs in 12 weeks."
