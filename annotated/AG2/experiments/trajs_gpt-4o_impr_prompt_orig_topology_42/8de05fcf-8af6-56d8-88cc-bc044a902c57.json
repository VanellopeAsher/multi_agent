      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.If she spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days, how many times as many articles did she write on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to uncover the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday compared to Tuesday. The available data includes her article count on Monday and Tuesday, as well as her total writing hours for the week.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Articles Written:**\n    - On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.\n    - On Tuesday, she wrote \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) more articles than on Monday.\n\n2. **Total Hours:**\n    - She spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over these three days.\n    - Each article takes 4 hours to write.\n\n3. **Articles on Wednesday:**\n    - Determine how many articles she wrote on Wednesday using total hours expended.\n\nLet's go through this systematically:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Articles on Tuesday:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Hours for Monday and Tuesday:**\n\n   - Monday: \\( 5 \\) articles \\( \\times 4 \\) hours/article = \\( 20 \\) hours\n   - Tuesday: \\( 7 \\) articles \\( \\times 4 \\) hours/article = \\( 28 \\) hours\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Hours for Monday and Tuesday} = 20 + 28 = 48 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Hours for Wednesday:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hours on Wednesday} = 104 - 48 = 56 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Articles on Wednesday:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Articles on Wednesday} = \\frac{56}{4} = 14\n   \\]\n\n5. **Ratio of Articles on Wednesday to Articles on Tuesday:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{14}{7} = 2\n   \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- **Monday:** \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) hours.\n- **Tuesday:** \\( 7 \\times 4 = 28 \\) hours.\n- **Wednesday:** \\( 14 \\times 4 = 56 \\) hours.\n  \nAdding these together confirms:\n\\[ 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nHence, Meredith wrote twice as many articles on Wednesday as compared to Tuesday. \n\nThe verified answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
