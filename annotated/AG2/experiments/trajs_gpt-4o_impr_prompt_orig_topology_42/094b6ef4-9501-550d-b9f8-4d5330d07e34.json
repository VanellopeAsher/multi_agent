Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. If the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length, how long is the shark?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, I'll employ a Case 1 approach: Direct Python Solution. We'll use simple algebraic calculations to determine the length of the shark.\n\nWe know:\n- Each remora is 6 inches long.\n- There are 2 remoras.\n- The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's length.\n\nWe're tasked with finding the length of the shark.\n\nLet's break it down into manageable steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras:**\n   - Since there are 2 remoras each 6 inches long, the total length of the remoras is \\(2 \\times 6\\) inches.\n\n2. **Set up the equation for the shark's length:**\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the length of the shark. According to the problem, the remoras' combined length is 10% of this length, i.e., \\( \\text{Total length of remoras} = 0.1 \\times L \\).\n\n3. **Solve the equation to find \\( L \\).**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Define the unknown variable\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Step 2: Total length of the remoras\ntotal_remoras_length = 2 * 6  # 2 remoras, each 6 inches long\n\n# Step 3: Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(total_remoras_length, 0.1 * L)\n\n# Step 4: Solve the equation for L\nshark_length = solve(equation, L)[0]\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(f\"The length of the shark is {shark_length} inches.\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will provide us with the length of the shark in inches.\n\n**VERIFICATION SECTION**\n\n1. **Calculate the total length of the remoras:**\n   - \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) inches.\n\n2. **Check the equation set-up:**\n   - The equation to solve is \\(12 = 0.1 \\times L\\).\n\n3. **Solve equation manually for verification:**\n   - Rearranging, we find \\(L = \\frac{12}{0.1}\\).\n   - This results in \\(L = 120\\).\n\nFinal verification and confidence in the solution, providing the answer in the correct format:\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]\n\nThe length of the shark is 120 inches."
