Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each. William bought five notebooks and a ballpen. He also decided to buy a pencil case that costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens. How much did he spend in all?"

We need the costs of notebooks, ballpens, and a pencil case.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Define the Prices**: Using the information given:\n   - Notebook price: \\( \\$1.50 \\)\n   - Ballpen price: \\( \\$0.50 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate Cost for Purchased Items**:\n   - Total cost for 5 notebooks: \\( 5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50 \\)\n   - Cost for 1 ballpen: \\( \\$0.50 \\)\n   - Total cost for the pencil case: Twice the cost of one notebook and two ballpens:\n     - Cost for one notebook and two ballpens: \\( 1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50 = 2.50 \\)\n     - Pencil case cost: \\( 2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00 \\)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Expenditure**:\n   - Total = Cost of 5 notebooks + Cost of 1 ballpen + Cost of the pencil case\n\nNow, let's translate this into Python code to compute the total expenditure.\n\n```python\n# Import the sympy package\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define prices using Rational for precision\nnotebook_price = Rational(3, 2)  # $1.50\nballpen_price = Rational(1, 2)    # $0.50\n\n# Compute costs\ncost_5_notebooks = 5 * notebook_price\ncost_1_ballpen = ballpen_price\ncost_pencil_case = 2 * (notebook_price + 2 * ballpen_price)\n\n# Calculate total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = cost_5_notebooks + cost_1_ballpen + cost_pencil_case\n\n# Print the result using print function\nprint(total_expenditure)\n```\n\n### Execution and Verification:\n\nNow let's go step-by-step to verify the calculations:\n\n1. **Verification of Cost Calculations**:\n   - For 5 notebooks: \\( 5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50 \\) is correctly calculated.\n   - For 1 ballpen: Cost remains \\( 0.50 \\).\n   - Calculation for a pencil case: \\( 1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50 = 2.50 \\), then doubled cost is \\( 5.00 \\).\n\n2. **Total Expenditure Verification**:\n   - Total: \\( 7.50 + 0.50 + 5.00 \\)\n   - Total = \\( 13.00 \\)\n\nThe calculations have been verified and confirm our solution.\n\n\\[\\boxed{13.00}\\]"
