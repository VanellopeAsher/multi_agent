Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

      "content": "To find out how many small t-shirts Octavia used, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's work through the problem step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify known quantities**:\n   - Small t-shirt: \\(3\\) square feet\n   - Medium t-shirt: \\(4\\) square feet\n   - Large t-shirt: \\(6\\) square feet\n   - Total area of the quilt: \\(101\\) square feet\n   - Number of medium shirts used: \\(8\\)\n   - Number of large shirts used: \\(6\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the total area covered by medium and large shirts**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area from medium shirts} = 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area from large shirts} = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining area**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining area} = 101 - (32 + 36)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up equation for the number of small shirts**:\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of small shirts. Each small shirt contributes \\(3\\) square feet. Thus, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   3x = \\text{Remaining area}\n   \\]\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the sympy library to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the unknown variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the area covered by medium and large t-shirts\narea_medium = 8 * 4\narea_large = 6 * 6\ntotal_known_area = area_medium + area_large\n\n# Total area of the quilt\ntotal_area = 101\n\n# Calculate the remaining area\nremaining_area = total_area - total_known_area\n\n# Equation for the number of small t-shirts\nequation = Eq(3 * x, remaining_area)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsmall_shirts_used = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(small_shirts_used)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the areas again**:\n   - Medium t-shirts covered: \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\)\n   - Large t-shirts covered: \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n   - Total covered by medium and large: \\(32 + 36 = 68\\)\n\n2. **Calculate remaining area**:\n   - Remaining area to be covered by small t-shirts: \\(101 - 68 = 33\\)\n\n3. **Verify number of small t-shirts**:\n   - Number of small shirts used: \\(\\frac{33}{3} = 11\\)\n\nAll calculations match and verification confirms the result. Therefore, the number of small shirts used is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."
