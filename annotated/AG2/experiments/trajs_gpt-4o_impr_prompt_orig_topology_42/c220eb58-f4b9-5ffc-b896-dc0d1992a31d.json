Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a direct computation approach with Python. The problem involves basic arithmetic operations.\n\nJames delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson. He delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu. We need to calculate the total number of messages delivered.\n\nLet's break the problem into steps:\n1. Calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu.\n2. Calculate the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages for Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.\n\nWe'll implement this in Python using the `sympy` library to keep any fractions intact, even though in this case, the arithmetic is straightforward.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_to_Thompson = 84\n\n# Number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu\nmessages_to_Yu = Rational(1, 3) * messages_to_Thompson\n\n# Total messages delivered to both teachers\ntotal_messages = messages_to_Thompson + messages_to_Yu\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Total messages delivered:\", total_messages)\n```\n\nNow let's compute the result. \n\n1. Calculate how many messages are delivered to Mr. Yu:\n   \\[\n   \\text{messages\\_to\\_Yu} = 1/3 \\times 84 = 28\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the total messages delivered:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total\\_messages} = 84 + 28 = 112\n   \\]\n\nVerification Steps:\n- Verify the calculations manually: \\(28 = \\frac{84}{3}\\).\n- Total messages calculation is correct: \\(84 + 28\\).\n  \nThus, the final answer for the total number of messages delivered is \\(\\boxed{112}\\)."
