Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJordan plays video games every day. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to know how many hours Jordan currently spends playing video games each day. Without this information, we can't determine how much he would earn if he used that time working instead.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Identify the missing data:** We need the number of hours Jordan plays video games each day. We'll represent this unknown value as `h_video_games`.\n\n2. **Formulate the calculation:**\n   - If Jordan uses his video game time to work, he would earn $10 * h_video_games each day.\n   - For one week (7 days): Total earnings = \\( 7 \\times (10 \\times h\\_video\\_games) \\).\n\n3. **Wrap in a query:** Without the actual daily hours spent on video games, we can't compute the value. If we had `h\\_video\\_games = x`, then potential weekly earnings would be \\( 70 \\times x \\).\n\nSince the required information is missing, the solution to the problem is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify:\n\n- Ensure there are no other assumptions made about the daily number of hours.\n- The math calculation for weekly earnings is correct if `h_video_games` were provided.\n\nThe final output cannot include actual earnings without `h_video_games`. Hence, the solution remains:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)"
