      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours. He then works double that duration on Wednesday. On Thursday, he puts in 2 hours less than his Wednesday's work hours. What is the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow the step-by-step process, calculating Bruce's work hours for each day and then summing them up.\n\nStep 1: Identify Bruce's work hours for each day.\n- Tuesday: Bruce works for 5 hours.\n- Wednesday: He works double the hours he worked on Tuesday. Therefore, on Wednesday, Bruce works \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) hours.\n- Thursday: He works 2 hours less than what he worked on Wednesday. Thus, on Thursday, Bruce works \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) hours.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days.\n- Total work hours = Tuesday's hours + Wednesday's hours + Thursday's hours\n- Total work hours = \\(5\\) (Tuesday) + \\(10\\) (Wednesday) + \\(8\\) (Thursday)\n\nNow, let's use Python to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of hours worked by Bruce\n\n# Hours worked on each day\nhours_tuesday = 5\nhours_wednesday = 2 * hours_tuesday\nhours_thursday = hours_wednesday - 2\n\n# Total hours worked over the three days\ntotal_hours = hours_tuesday + hours_wednesday + hours_thursday\n\n# Output the total hours\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nLet's run this to find out the total number of hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total work hours} = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \\]\n\nBruce worked a total of 23 hours over these three days. \n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Calculate hours for each day individually:\n    - Tuesday: 5 hours\n    - Wednesday: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) hours (correct)\n    - Thursday: \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) hours (correct)\n\n2. Summing up each day's work:\n    - Total = \\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\\)\n\nEverything checks out, the math is consistent throughout.\n\nFinal answer is \\( \\boxed{23} \\)."
