Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party. There are two different heel heights: 4.5 inches and 2.5 inches. To find the average heel height, we must consider both the number of women wearing each heel height and the heel heights themselves.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Identify the number of women wearing each heel height:\n   - 3 women are wearing 4.5-inch heels.\n   - 3 women are wearing 2.5-inch heels.\n\n2. Calculate the total height contributed by each group:\n   - Total height from the women wearing 4.5-inch heels = 3 * 4.5 inches.\n   - Total height from the women wearing 2.5-inch heels = 3 * 2.5 inches.\n\n3. Find the total height contributed by all women and divide it by the total number of women to get the average heel height.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of women and their respective heel heights\nwomen_4_5 = 3\nheel_height_4_5 = Rational(4.5)\n\nwomen_2_5 = 3\nheel_height_2_5 = Rational(2.5)\n\n# Total heel height contribution\ntotal_height_4_5 = women_4_5 * heel_height_4_5\ntotal_height_2_5 = women_2_5 * heel_height_2_5\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = women_4_5 + women_2_5\n\n# Total height\ntotal_height = total_height_4_5 + total_height_2_5\n\n# Average heel height\naverage_height = total_height / total_women\n\n# Output the average height using the fraction form\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION \n\n1. Calculate each component step:\n   - Total height for 4.5-inch heels: \\(3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5\\) inches.\n   - Total height for 2.5-inch heels: \\(3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\) inches.\n\n2. Calculate the total height:\n   - Total height = 13.5 + 7.5 = 21 inches.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of women:\n   - Total women = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n4. Calculate the average heel height:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average height} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculation has been verified step-by-step.\n\nTherefore, the average height of the heels at the party is \\(\\boxed{3.5}\\) inches."
