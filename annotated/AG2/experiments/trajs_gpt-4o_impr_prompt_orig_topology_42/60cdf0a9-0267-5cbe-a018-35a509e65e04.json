Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of each crayon muffin that Kate sold.\n\nLet's go through the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Crayons**: \n   - Kate received 3 boxes of crayons.\n   - Each box contains 64 crayons.\n   - Total crayons = \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Crayon Muffins**:\n   - Each crayon muffin is made by melting 8 crayons together.\n   - To find the total number of muffins, divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per muffin.\n   - Total muffins = \\( \\frac{192}{8} = 24 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Price of Each Muffin**:\n   - Kate made a total of $36 from selling all the muffins.\n   - To find the price per muffin, divide the total revenue by the number of muffins.\n   - Price per muffin = \\( \\frac{36}{24} \\).\n\nNow, let's perform the calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total crayons and crayons per muffin\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\ncrayons_per_muffin = 8\n\n# Total muffins\ntotal_muffins = total_crayons // crayons_per_muffin\n\n# Total revenue and price per muffin\ntotal_revenue = 36\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(total_revenue, total_muffins)\n\n# Output the price per muffin using a rational fraction\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the price each crayon muffin sells for and express it as a fraction.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. The calculation of the total number of crayons as \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\) is correct.\n2. The total number of muffins, \\( \\frac{192}{8} = 24\\), is also correct because 192 divided by 8 equals 24.\n3. Dividing the total revenue of $36 by 24 muffins gives us the price per muffin.\n\nThus the price per muffin is \\( \\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2} \\), which matches our calculations. Therefore, each muffin sells for $\\frac{3}{2}$ dollars, or $1.50.\n\nThe verified answer is \\(\\boxed{1.5}\\)."
