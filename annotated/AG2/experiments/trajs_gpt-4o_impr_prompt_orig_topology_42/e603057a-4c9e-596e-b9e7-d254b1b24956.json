Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSeth is twice as old as Brooke. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36. How old is Seth?"

      "content": "To tackle this problem, let's first set up variables to represent the current ages of Seth and Brooke. Then, we'll use the information provided to create equations and solve for Seth's age.\n\nLet's use the following variable definitions:\n- Let \\( S \\) represent Seth's current age.\n- Let \\( B \\) represent Brooke's current age.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following pieces of information:\n1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \n   \\[\n   S = 2B\n   \\]\n2. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36:\n   \\[\n   (S + 3) + (B + 3) = 36\n   \\]\n\nNow let's work through these equations to find Seth's age \\( S \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. **Substitute** the first equation into the second:\n   \\[\n   (2B + 3) + (B + 3) = 36\n   \\]\n2. **Simplify** the equation:\n   \\[\n   3B + 6 = 36\n   \\]\n3. **Solve** for \\( B \\), Brooke's age:\n   \\[\n   3B = 30 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B = 10\n   \\]\n4. **Find** Seth's age \\( S \\) using \\( S = 2B \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\nLet's verify this result by checking the conditions given in the problem:\n- Seth is indeed twice as old as Brooke: \\( S = 20 \\) and \\( B = 10 \\), where \\( 20 = 2 \\times 10 \\).\n- In 3 years, Seth will be 23 and Brooke will be 13. The sum will be:\n  \\[\n  23 + 13 = 36\n  \\]\nBoth conditions are satisfied.\n\nSince the verification is consistent with the problem statement, we have found the correct age for Seth.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"
