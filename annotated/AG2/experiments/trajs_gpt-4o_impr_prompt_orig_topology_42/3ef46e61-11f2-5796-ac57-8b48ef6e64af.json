      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. However, on Fridays, he spends an additional 2 hours at work due to high call volumes. How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total hours Tim spends at work each day and for the entire week.\n2. Convert these hours into the number of calls he handles, given it takes 15 minutes per call.\n\nLet's tackle it using Python and sympy to ensure precise calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\ndef calculate_weekly_calls():\n    # Tim works 6 hours each day from Monday to Thursday\n    hours_per_day = 6\n    \n    # On Friday, he works an additional 2 hours\n    extra_friday_hours = 2\n    friday_hours = hours_per_day + extra_friday_hours\n    \n    # Total weekly hours worked\n    total_weekly_hours = (4 * hours_per_day) + friday_hours\n    \n    # Tim takes 15 minutes to handle a call\n    minutes_per_call = 15\n    \n    # Convert total weekly hours to minutes\n    total_minutes = total_weekly_hours * 60\n    \n    # Calculate total number of calls handled\n    # Using Rational to maintain the calculation in fraction if needed\n    total_calls = Rational(total_minutes, minutes_per_call)\n    \n    print(\"Total calls handled in a 5-day work week:\", total_calls)\n\ncalculate_weekly_calls()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Step 1:** Calculate the hours Tim works from Monday to Thursday and add the extra Friday hours.\n- **Step 2:** Convert the total hours into minutes and divide by the minutes per call to find the number of calls.\n- **Step 3:** Use the `Rational` from sympy for exact fractional calculation before converting to integer count of calls.\n\nBy following this method, we ensure an accurate calculation of the calls Tim handles during the week.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Daily calls from Monday to Thursday:**\n   - Tim works 6 hours/day, so: \\(6 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n   - Calls per day: \\( \\frac{360 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \\text{ calls}\\).\n\n2. **Friday's calls:**\n   - Tim works 8 hours on Friday, so: \\(8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n   - Calls on Friday: \\( \\frac{480 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ minutes/call}} = 32 \\text{ calls}\\).\n\n3. **Weekly total calls:**\n   - Total: \\( (4 \\times 24) \\text{ calls} + 32 \\text{ calls} = 96 \\text{ calls} + 32 \\text{ calls} = 128 \\text{ calls}\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer:** The weekly total of calls Tim handles is therefore correctly calculated as 128.\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{128}\\)"
