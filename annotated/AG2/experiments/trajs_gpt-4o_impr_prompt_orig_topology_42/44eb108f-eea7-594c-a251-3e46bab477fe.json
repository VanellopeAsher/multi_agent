Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces certain inches long. At last she obtains 8 pieces, then how many inches was each piece?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of each piece of wire in inches after Tracy cuts a 4-foot long wire into 8 equal pieces.\n\n**Key Concept**: \nA foot is a unit of length in the customary system that is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, the entire length of the wire in inches can be calculated by converting from feet to inches.\n\n**Conversion and Calculation**:\n1. Convert the entire length of the wire from feet to inches.\n2. Divide the total length in inches by the number of pieces to find the length of each piece.\n\nLet's use Python to solve this problem using these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert the total length from feet to inches\ntotal_length_inches = 4 * 12  # since 1 foot = 12 inches\n\n# Step 2: Divide the total length in inches by the number of pieces\nnumber_of_pieces = 8\nlength_of_each_piece = total_length_inches / number_of_pieces\n\n# Print the resultant length of each piece in inches\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(length_of_each_piece))\n```\n\nNow, let's verify our solution.\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n1. We know that 1 foot = 12 inches; hence, 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.\n2. Since the total length of the wire is 48 inches and it's divided equally into 8 pieces, the length of each piece should be \\( \\frac{48}{8} \\).\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\text{ inches}}{8} = 6 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nAfter verifying the steps, the length of each piece is indeed 6 inches.\n\nTherefore, the length of each piece of wire is \\( \\boxed{6} \\) inches."
