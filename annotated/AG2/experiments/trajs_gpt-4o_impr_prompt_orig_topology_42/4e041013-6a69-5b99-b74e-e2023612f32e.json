Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden. He can accommodate 6 red tulips per row and 8 blue tulips per row. If Jackson purchases 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of tulips will he end up planting?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow a direct Python solution approach (Case 1) since it involves straightforward calculations to determine the number of rows Jackson can plant.\n\n### Key Idea:\n- Jackson has specific row capacities for two types of tulips: red and blue.\n- We'll find out the number of rows he can plant for each type of tulip separately and then verify if they are planted exclusively in separate rows or not integrated.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. Calculate the number of rows for red tulips by dividing the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row.\n2. Similarly, calculate the number of rows for blue tulips by dividing the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row.\n3. Sum the number of rows required for each type of tulip to find the total number of rows Jackson will end up planting.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\nred_tulips_total = 36\nblue_tulips_total = 24\nred_tulips_per_row = 6\nblue_tulips_per_row = 8\n\n# Calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips\nrows_red = red_tulips_total // red_tulips_per_row\nrows_blue = blue_tulips_total // blue_tulips_per_row\n\n# Calculate total rows\ntotal_rows = rows_red + rows_blue\n\n# Print the result as a fraction format if there's any remainder\nprint(\"Rows for red tulips:\", Rational(rows_red))\nprint(\"Rows for blue tulips:\", Rational(rows_blue))\nprint(\"Total rows:\", Rational(total_rows))\n```\n\n### Execution and Result:\nWhen you run the above code, you will receive:\n\n- The number of rows for red tulips.\n- The number of rows for blue tulips.\n- The total number of rows for all tulips.\n\n### Verification:\nVerify each calculation is correct, ensuring:\n1. Division for the number of rows correctly divides into whole numbers.\n2. Total rows include both types without errors.\n\n### Solution:\nAfter verifying our solution step-by-step:\n\n- Jackson can plant 6 rows for red tulips (36 รท 6 = 6).\n- Jackson can plant 3 rows for blue tulips (24 รท 8 = 3).\n\nThus, Jackson ends up planting a total of 9 rows of tulips, which are planted separately by their color specification.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{9} \\)."
