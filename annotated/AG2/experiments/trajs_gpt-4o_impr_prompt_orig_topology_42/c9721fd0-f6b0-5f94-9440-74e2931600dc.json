Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Patty's plumbing services, which includes the service fee, the labor cost based on the time worked, and the cost of the parts used. We'll follow a direct Python solution (Case 1).\n\nHere's how we can break it down:\n\n1. **Service Fee**: This is a flat rate of $40.\n2. **Labor Cost**: Patty charges $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour. For 2.25 hours of work, we'll first round up the hours to the nearest whole number because Patty charges a fixed fee for any fraction of an hour. Thus, 2.25 hours is rounded up to 3 hours.\n3. **Parts Cost**: The cost of parts for this job is $60.\n\nThe total bill is the sum of these three components.\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import ceiling\n\n# Cost constants\nservice_fee = 40\nhourly_rate = 35\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# Time worked in hours\ntime_worked = 2.25\n\n# Total bill calculation\n# Round up the hours to the nearest whole number\nrounded_hours = ceiling(time_worked)\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = service_fee + (rounded_hours * hourly_rate) + parts_cost\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify each part of our calculation to ensure accuracy:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Service Fee Verification**: The service fee is correctly stated as $40.\n2. **Labor Cost Calculation**: \n   - Time worked: 2.25 hours rounded up to 3 hours because Patty charges for a whole fraction of an hour.\n   - Cost for 3 hours: \\(3 \\times 35 = 105\\).\n3. **Parts Cost Verification**: $60 is correctly added for the parts.\n4. **Total Cost**: The sum is \\(40 + 105 + 60 = 205\\).\n\nTherefore, the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing is \\(\\boxed{205}\\)."
