      "content": "To solve this problem, I'll outline the method of calculating the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken meal**:  \n   The chicken meal costs $120.  \n\n2. **Calculate the cost of milk**:  \n   Marie bought 5 packs of milk, each costing $30. So, the total cost for milk is:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 30 = 150\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of apples**:  \n   Marie bought 40 apples, each costing $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for the apples is:  \n   \\[\n   40 \\times 1.50 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of items excluding the boxes of pizza**:  \n   Add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:  \n   \\[\n   120 + 150 + 60 = 330\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how much was spent on pizzas**:  \n   Marie paid a total of $900. Therefore, the amount spent on pizzas is the total paid minus the amount spent on other items:  \n   \\[\n   900 - 330 = 570\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered**:  \n   Each box of pizza costs $57. Therefore, the number of boxes can be found by dividing the total amount spent on pizzas by the cost per box:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{570}{57} = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, Marie ordered 10 boxes of pizza. \n\nLet's now discuss this solution and ensure that everyone concurs with these calculations."
