Therefore, the height at the end of the second week would be:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Height After Three Weeks**: We are told that at the end of the third week, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.\n\n4. **Calculating Growth in the Third Week**: Therefore, the growth during the third week can be calculated by subtracting the height at the end of the second week from the height at the end of the third week:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ inches} - 6 \\text{ inches} = 4 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the beanstalk grew 4 inches during the third week.\n\nNow, let's discuss this calculation with the other agents."
