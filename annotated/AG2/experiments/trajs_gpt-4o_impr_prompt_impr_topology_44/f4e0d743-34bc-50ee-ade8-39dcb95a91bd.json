      "content": "Sure, let's break down Madeline's expenses step by step and determine the total annual cost. Here's how we can calculate the expenses:\n\n1. **Food Costs:**\n   - Food costs $25 per week.\n   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so monthly food costs: \n     \\[ 25 \\text{ (dollars per week)} \\times 4 \\text{ (weeks per month)} = 100 \\text{ (dollars per month)} \\]\n   - There are 12 months in a year, so annual food costs:\n     \\[ 100 \\text{ (dollars per month)} \\times 12 \\text{ (months per year)} = 1200 \\text{ dollars per year} \\]\n\n2. **Treats Costs:**\n   - Treats cost $20 per month.\n   - So, annually:\n     \\[ 20 \\text{ (dollars per month)} \\times 12 \\text{ (months per year)} = 240 \\text{ dollars per year} \\]\n\n3. **Medicine Costs:**\n   - Medicine costs $100 per month.\n   - Annually, the medicine costs:\n     \\[ 100 \\text{ (dollars per month)} \\times 12 \\text{ (months per year)} = 1200 \\text{ dollars per year} \\]\n\n4. **Special Shampoo Costs:**\n   - Shampoo costs $15 per month.\n   - Annually, the shampoo costs:\n     \\[ 15 \\text{ (dollars per month)} \\times 12 \\text{ (months per year)} = 180 \\text{ dollars per year} \\]\n\n5. **Toy Costs:**\n   - Toy costs $10 every two months.\n   - In a year, the toy is bought:\n     \\[ \\frac{12 \\text{ (months per year)}}{2 \\text{ (months per toy)}} = 6 \\text{ toys per year} \\]\n   - Annually, the toy costs:\n     \\[ 10 \\text{ (dollars per toy)} \\times 6 \\text{ (toys per year)} = 60 \\text{ dollars per year} \\]\n\n6. **Total Annual Expenses:**\n   - Add up all the annual expenses:\n     \\[\n     1200 \\text{ (food)} + 240 \\text{ (treats)} + 1200 \\text{ (medicine)} + 180 \\text{ (shampoo)} + 60 \\text{ (toys)}\n     \\]\n   - This equates to:\n     \\[\n     = 1200 + 240 + 1200 + 180 + 60 = 2880 \\text{ dollars per year}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Madeline spends $2880 per year on her dog. \n\nI have completed the solution. Let's discuss and compare our calculations to ensure accuracy."
