So, the number of robots = 2000 / 2.\n   - The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Hence, the number of footballs = 2000 * 2.\n\n2. **Calculate Each Item Count**:\n   - Number of helmets = 2000\n   - Number of robots = 2000 / 2 = 1000\n   - Number of footballs = 2000 * 2 = 4000\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Items**:\n   - Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs\n   - Total number of items = 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000\n\nTherefore, Dominick saw a total of 7000 items in the changing room."
