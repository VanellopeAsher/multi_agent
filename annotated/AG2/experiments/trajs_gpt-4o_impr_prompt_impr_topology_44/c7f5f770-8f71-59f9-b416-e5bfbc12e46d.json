Since Kyle took 6 fries, Billy takes \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) fries.\n    - Remaining fries: \\( 24 - 12 = 12 \\).\n\n4. **Colby's Action**: Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took. Since Kyle took 6 fries, Colby takes \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\) fries.\n    - Remaining fries: \\( 12 - 3 = 9 \\).\n\n5. **Final Situation**: We know that after Ginger gives some fries to Griffin, he has 33 fries. Therefore, the fries Ginger gave Griffin is the difference between the fries he ended up with and the fries he had after everyone else took theirs:\n    - Fries Ginger gave Griffin: \\( 33 - 9 = 24 \\).\n\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries."
