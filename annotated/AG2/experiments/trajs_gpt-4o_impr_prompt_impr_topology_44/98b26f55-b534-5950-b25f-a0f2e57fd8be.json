We know that Jordan spends a certain amount of time playing video games every day, but we aren't provided with this exact amount. Let's denote the average number of hours Jordan spends playing video games per day as \\( h \\).\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Establish Daily Hours Spent on Video Games**:  \n   Assume Jordan spends \\( h \\) hours playing video games each day.\n\n2. **Calculate Weekly Hours**:  \n   Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours Jordan would instead work in one week is \\( 7h \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Earnings**:  \n   Given that Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, if he worked these hours instead of playing video games, he would earn:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 10 \\times 7h = 70h \\text{ dollars in a week.}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   To determine the exact amount he would earn, you'd need to know the value of \\( h \\), the number of hours he spends playing video games each day.\n\nEngaging in a discussion with the other agents now seems appropriate to confirm our approach and assumptions."
