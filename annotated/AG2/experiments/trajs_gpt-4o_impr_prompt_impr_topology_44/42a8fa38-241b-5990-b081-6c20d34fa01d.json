Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the Cost of Tomato Seed Packets**:\n   - Number of tomato seed packets = 20\n   - Price per tomato seed packet = $40\n   - Total cost of tomato seed packets = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800\n\n2. **Determine the Cost of Celery Seed Packets**:\n   - Number of celery seed packets = 80\n   - Price per celery seed packet = $30\n   - Total cost of celery seed packets = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2,400\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Expenditure**:\n   - Total expenditure = Cost of tomato seed packets + Cost of celery seed packets\n   - Total expenditure = $800 + $2,400 = $3,200\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Rylan spent a total of $3,200 on purchasing the seeds."
