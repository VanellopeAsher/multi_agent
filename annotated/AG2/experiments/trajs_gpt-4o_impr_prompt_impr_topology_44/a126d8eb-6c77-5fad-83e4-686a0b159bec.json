Since the offer is \"buy one, get one 50% off,\" for every two T-shirts, one is sold at full price and the other at half price.\n   - So, for each pair of T-shirts:\n     - First T-shirt = $80\n     - Second T-shirt at 50% off = $80 * 0.5 = $40\n     - Total for each pair = $80 + $40 = $120\n   - Since Jake buys 20 T-shirts, he buys 10 pairs (20 T-shirts / 2 = 10 pairs).\n   - Total cost for T-shirts = 10 pairs * $120 per pair = $1,200\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**\n   - Original price of the shoes = $400\n   - Discount on the shoes is 40%\n   - Discount amount = $400 * 0.4 = $160\n   - Discounted price of the shoes = $400 - $160 = $240\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount Jake spends:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes\n   - Total cost = $1,200 + $240 = $1,440\n\nTherefore, Jake spends a total of $1,440 at the store."

Calculating the cost of shoes with a 40% discount:\n   - Original price is $400 with a reduction of $160, resulting in a final price of $240.\n\n3.
