Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate Gerald's weekly earnings from the daycare:**\n   - Gerald earns $30 every day from working at the daycare.\n   - A week typically consists of 7 days.\n   - Therefore, his earnings from the daycare for the week are: \n     \\[ 30 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 210 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Gerald's earnings from babysitting:**\n   - Gerald babysits his neighbor's kids for 2 hours each day at a rate of $0.\n   - Since his hourly rate for babysitting is $0, regardless of the hours worked, his earnings from babysitting for the entire week is: \n     \\[ 0 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 0 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Geraldâ€™s total weekly earnings:**\n   - Total earnings = Earnings from daycare + Earnings from babysitting\n   - Total weekly earnings = $210 + $0 = $210\n\n4. **Subtract Gerald's expenses:**\n   - Gerald spent $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n   - The amount left after expenses = Total earnings - Expenses\n   - Money left = $210 - $100 = $110\n\nThus, after considering his earnings and expenses for the week, Gerald has $110 left."
