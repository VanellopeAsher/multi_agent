So, the cost per year is:\n\\[ \n10 \\, (\\text{cost per visit}) \\times 3 \\, (\\text{visits per year}) = 30 \\, (\\text{dollars per year})\n\\]\nFor 10 years, the total cost would be:\n\\[ \n30 \\, (\\text{dollars per year}) \\times 10 \\, (\\text{years}) = 300 \\, (\\text{dollars})\n\\]\n\nAfter 10 years, the cost of a single visit increases by 150%. The new cost per visit becomes:\n\\[ \n10 + (10 \\times 1.5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \\, (\\text{dollars per visit})\n\\]\nNow, for the next 3 years, the cost per year becomes:\n\\[ \n25 \\, (\\text{cost per visit}) \\times 3 \\, (\\text{visits per year}) = 75 \\, (\\text{dollars per year})\n\\]\nSo, for 3 years, the total cost is:\n\\[ \n75 \\, (\\text{dollars per year}) \\times 3 \\, (\\text{years}) = 225 \\, (\\text{dollars})\n\\]\n\nFinally, Pauline's total expenditure over the 13 years is:\n\\[ \n300 \\, (\\text{dollars for 10 years}) + 225 \\, (\\text{dollars for 3 years}) = 525 \\, (\\text{dollars})\n\\]\n\nThus, Pauline spends a total of $525 on visits to the museum over 13 years."
