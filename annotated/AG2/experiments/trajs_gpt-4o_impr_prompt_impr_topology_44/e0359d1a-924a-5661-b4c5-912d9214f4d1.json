In the problem, Robert has 3 pounds of candy, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. The total amount of candy is 12 pounds and dividing this equally among the three individuals, each person would receive 4 pounds of candy.\n\nThe calculations from both solutions agree:\n\n- The total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.\n- Each person's share = 12 pounds / 3 people = 4 pounds of candy.\n\nThe code execution output also confirmed this, showing that each person gets 4.0 pounds of candy.\n\nTherefore, the final verified solution for how much candy each would have is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{4}**"
