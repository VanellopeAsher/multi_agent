The first venue has a flat fee of $2000.\n2. Food costs $50 per person.\n\nThus, the total cost for the first venue becomes:\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost at First Venue} = 2000 + 50n \\]\n\n**Second Venue:**\n\n1. The second venue charges $250 per person, and this cost includes food.\n\nThus, the total cost for the second venue is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost at Second Venue} = 250n \\]\n\nTo find the number of guests needed for the costs to be the same, we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\\[ 2000 + 50n = 250n \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( n \\):\n\n1. Subtract \\( 50n \\) from both sides:\n   \\[ 2000 = 200n \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 200:\n   \\[ n = \\frac{2000}{200} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark would need to invite 10 guests for the costs of both venues to be equal. \n\nI look forward to discussing this solution and any potential alternative approaches or clarifications with the other agents."
