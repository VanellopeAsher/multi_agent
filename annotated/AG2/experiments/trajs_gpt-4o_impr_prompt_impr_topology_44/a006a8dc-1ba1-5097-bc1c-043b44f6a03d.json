Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Group Composition**:\n   - There are 20 kids, divided equally into two groups: boys and girls. Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\n2. **Seashells Brought by Boys**:\n   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.\n   - So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total shells by boys} = 10 \\text{ boys} \\times 60 \\text{ shells per boy} = 600 \\text{ shells}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Seashells Brought by Girls**:\n   - According to the problem, the girls brought back the same number of seashells as the boys, plus an additional 4.5 times the number of seashells brought by the boys.\n   - Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total shells by girls} = 600 + 4.5 \\times 600 = 600 + 2700 = 3300 \\text{ shells}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Seashells Brought by Each Girl**:\n   - Since 10 girls brought a total of 3300 seashells, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Shells per girl} = \\frac{3300 \\text{ shells}}{10 \\text{ girls}} = 330 \\text{ shells per girl}\n     \\]\n\nIn conclusion, each girl brought back 330 seashells."
