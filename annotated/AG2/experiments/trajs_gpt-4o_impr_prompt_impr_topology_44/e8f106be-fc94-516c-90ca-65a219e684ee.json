      "content": "To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy for his fence, we'll need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard, which forms the boundary where James wants to hang the streamers.\n\nHere's how you can calculate it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Dimensions of the Fence**: \n   - Long side = 20 feet\n   - Short side = 15 feet\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle**:\n   The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the Values and Calculate**:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nSince the streamers are to be hung only along the fence and none on the tree, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper in total for the fence. \n\nNow I will share this solution with the team to see if there are any different approaches or considerations."
