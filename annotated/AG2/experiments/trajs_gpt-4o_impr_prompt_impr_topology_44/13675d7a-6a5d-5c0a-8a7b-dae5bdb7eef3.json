Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Wheels Needed for Cars:**\n   - Each car requires 4 wheels.\n   - With 57 cars, the total wheels needed for cars is:\n     \\[\n     57 \\times 4 = 228 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Wheels Needed for Motorcycles:**\n   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.\n   - With 73 motorcycles, the total wheels needed for motorcycles is:\n     \\[\n     73 \\times 2 = 146 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Wheels Required for All Toys:**\n   - Add the wheels needed for cars and motorcycles:\n     \\[\n     228 + 146 = 374 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine Initial Total Wheels in the Box:**\n   - We are told there are 276 wheels left in the box after assembling the toys.\n   - Hence, the initial number of wheels in the box is the total required plus the remaining:\n     \\[\n     374 + 276 = 650 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of wheels in the box was 650 wheels.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
