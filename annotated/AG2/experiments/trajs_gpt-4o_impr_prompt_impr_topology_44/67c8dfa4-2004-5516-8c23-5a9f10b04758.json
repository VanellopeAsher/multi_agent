      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first define the problem in terms of variables and then methodically break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of 5 canvas bags Tara bought.\n\n2. **Cost Calculation**:\n   - Each pack costs $4, so the total cost Tara spent on buying the canvas bags is \\( 4x \\).\n\n3. **Sales Calculation**:\n   - Each pack contains 5 bags, and thus Tara has \\( 5x \\) bags in total.\n   - She sells each of these bags for $8, so the total revenue from selling the bags is \\( 8 \\times 5x = 40x \\).\n\n4. **Profit Calculation**:\n   - Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.\n   - Given that the profit is $160, the equation for profit is:\n     \\[\n     40x - 4x = 160\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplify and Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     36x = 160\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 36:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{160}{36} \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{40}{9} \n     \\]\n\nThe fraction indicates that the number of packs must be an integer, so let's verify the calculation, because implicitly Tara bought whole packs. Re-assessing the fractional part suggests adjusting our arithmetic because likely \\( 160 \\) was divided by the wrong  part or a recheck is needed for calculation consistency. But if following by solving  number of packs it can be considered as initially $18$ bags suggest, the closest \\( x = 4.5 \\) then nearby rounding or approach is needed since exact fractional approach wasn't getting integer meaning given condition. Double check may consider the higher $5$ to meet desired number with the solution scope that was an initial check oversight. \n\nBut both \\( 5 \\) to verify mathematically proceed as independency suggestion should agree for the solution. Discussion and verification might be at delay given non integer packs consideration, or re-step verification. Further execution examination will confirm integer solution consistencies meanwhile ensure coverage initial concept is logical.\n\n"
