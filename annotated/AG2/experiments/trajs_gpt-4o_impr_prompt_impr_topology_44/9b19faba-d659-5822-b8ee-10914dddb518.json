      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes Sunny sold for each type of product on each day and then calculate his earnings from these sales. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem and set up equations from the provided information.\n\n- **Saturday Sales:**\n  - Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes\n  - Let \\( x \\) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday. So, \\( x = s - 4 \\) because on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday.\n\n- **Sunday Sales:**\n  - Gingerbread sold: 10 (Saturday) + 5 = 15 boxes\n  - Apple Pie sold: 15 boxes (given)\n\n- **Monday Sales:**\n  - Gingerbread sold: 2 boxes\n  - Apple Pie sold: 4 boxes\n\n### Step 2: Express the total sales:\n\nTo develop the equation for Saturday’s apple pie sales, use:\n- From Sunday, apple pie sales were 15 boxes. Hence, on Saturday, 4 fewer boxes means \\( x = 15 - 4 = 11 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes sold each day:\n\n- **Saturday:**\n  - Gingerbread = 10 boxes\n  - Apple Pie = 11 boxes\n\n- **Sunday:**\n  - Gingerbread = 15 boxes\n  - Apple Pie = 15 boxes\n\n- **Monday:**\n  - Gingerbread = 2 boxes\n  - Apple Pie = 4 boxes\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the earnings from each type of product over three days:\n\n- **Gingerbread Earnings:**\n  - Total Gingerbread sold = Saturday + Sunday + Monday\n  - = 10 + 15 + 2 = 27 boxes\n  - Earnings from Gingerbread = 27 boxes * $6/box = $162\n\n- **Apple Pie Earnings:**\n  - Total Apple Pie sold = Saturday + Sunday + Monday\n  - = 11 + 15 + 4 = 30 boxes\n  - Earnings from Apple Pie = 30 boxes * $15/box = $450\n\n### Step 5: Total Earnings Calculation:\n\n- **Total Earnings** = Earnings from Gingerbread + Earnings from Apple Pie\n- Total Earnings = $162 + $450 = $612\n\nTherefore, Sunny earned a total of $612 over the three days."
