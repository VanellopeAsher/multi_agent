Thus, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3}x = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the Total Number of Students \\( x \\):**\n   - To find \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 30 \\times 3 = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 90 students at that grade level. \n\nI look forward to discussing this approach with the team or addressing any questions or alternative solutions they might suggest."
