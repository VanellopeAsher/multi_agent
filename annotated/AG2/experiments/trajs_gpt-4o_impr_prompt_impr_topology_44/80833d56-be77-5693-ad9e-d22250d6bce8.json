Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Hours of Running per Week**:\n   - John runs 10 hours on the first day.\n   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. Therefore, he runs \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) hours each on those two days.\n\n   Total running time per week:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ hours} + 5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Distance Run per Week**:\n   - John runs a total of 100 miles per week.\n\n3. **Calculate John's Average Speed**:\n   - Speed is calculated using the formula \\( \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\).\n   - John's average speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{20 \\text{ hours}} = 5 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\nThus, John runs at an average speed of 5 miles per hour. \n\nI am now ready to discuss this solution or listen to suggestions or corrections from other agents if there are any considerations I might have missed."
