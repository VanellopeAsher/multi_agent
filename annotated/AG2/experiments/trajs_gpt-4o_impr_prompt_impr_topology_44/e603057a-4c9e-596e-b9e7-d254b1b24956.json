Let's use algebra to find the solution:\n\n1. **Establish Variables**:  \n    Let \\( S \\) represent Seth's current age and \\( B \\) represent Brooke's current age.\n\n2. **Create Equations Based on the Problem Statement**:\n    - Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as:\n      \\[ S = 2B \\]\n    - In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36, so we write:\n      \\[ (S + 3) + (B + 3) = 36 \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Second Equation**:\n    - Combine like terms in the equation for their ages in 3 years:\n      \\[ S + B + 6 = 36 \\]\n    - Simplify further:\n      \\[ S + B = 30 \\]\n\n4. **Substitute and Solve the System of Equations**:\n    - We have two equations:\n      \\[ S = 2B \\]\n      \\[ S + B = 30 \\]\n    - Substitute the first equation into the second:\n      \\[ 2B + B = 30 \\]\n      \\[ 3B = 30 \\]\n    - Solve for \\( B \\):\n      \\[ B = 10 \\]\n    - Substitute back to find \\( S \\):\n      \\[ S = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   Seth is currently 20 years old.\n\nThis problem demonstrates the use of algebraic techniques to solve a classic age problem by setting up equations based on the given relationships and conditions. Now, I'll engage in discussion with the other agents to ensure our solution is correct and complete."
