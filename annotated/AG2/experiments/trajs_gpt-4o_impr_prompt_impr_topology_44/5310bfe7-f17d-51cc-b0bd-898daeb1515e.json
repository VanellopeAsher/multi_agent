Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the known information:**\n   - Richie scored 90 goals.\n   - Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n   - Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\n2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**\n   - Let \\( M \\) be the number of goals scored by Mark.\n   - Let \\( A \\) be the number of goals scored by Anna.\n   - Since Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark, we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     R = M + 30\n     \\]\n   - Since Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna, we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     R = A + 55\n     \\]\n   - We also know Richie scored 90 goals:\n     \\[\n     R = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the equations for Mark and Anna's goals:**\n   - Substitute \\( R = 90 \\) into the equations:\n     \\[\n     90 = M + 30 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad M = 90 - 30 = 60\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     90 = A + 55 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad A = 90 - 55 = 35\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total goals scored by all three teenagers:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total goals} = R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35 = 185\n   \\]\n\nThus, all three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."
