      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: \n   We know that one individual takes 5 days to paint half of a house. Therefore, the same individual would take 10 days to paint the entire house (since painting half of the house takes 5 days, painting the full house would take twice that time).\n\n2. **Calculate the Individual Rate**:\n   If one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, their rate of painting is 1 whole house per 10 days. This can also be expressed as \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) of a house per day.\n\n3. **Calculate the Team Rate**:\n   When you have 5 individuals working together, their combined rate of painting is the sum of their individual rates. So, the team can paint:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   houses per day.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Time for the Team**:\n   At a rate of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) a house per day, the team will take 2 full days to paint the entire house. \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time to paint 1 house} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = 2 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert Days to Hours**:\n   Assuming standard working hours (e.g., 8 hours a day), the total number of hours required would be:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ hours per day} = 16 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, a team of 5 individuals will take 16 hours to paint the entire house, assuming they work 8 hours a day."

Agent Problem Solver has calculated that a single individual takes 10 days to paint a full house, and thus 5 individuals working together (at a combined rate of painting \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of a house per day) would take 2 days to complete the task, translating to 16 hours assuming 8-hour workdays.\n\n2.
