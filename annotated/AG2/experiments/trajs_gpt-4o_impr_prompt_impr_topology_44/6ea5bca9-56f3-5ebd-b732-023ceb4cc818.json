The total number of cards in hundreds is given as:\n   \\[\n   B + S + P = 3.41\n   \\]\n\n2. Becca has 0.12 hundred more cards than Smendrick:\n   \\[\n   B = S + 0.12\n   \\]\n\n3. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has:\n   \\[\n   S = 3P\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Equations\n\nSubstitute the value of \\( S \\) from the third equation into the second equation:\n\\[ \nB = 3P + 0.12 \n\\]\n\nNow replace \\( B \\) and \\( S \\) in the first equation:\n\\[ \n(3P + 0.12) + 3P + P = 3.41 \n\\]\n\nSimplifying the above equation:\n\\[ \n7P + 0.12 = 3.41 \n\\]\n\nSubtract 0.12 from both sides:\n\\[ \n7P = 3.29 \n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 7 to solve for \\( P \\):\n\\[ \nP = \\frac{3.29}{7} \\approx 0.47 \n\\]\n\nUsing \\( P = 0.47 \\), calculate \\( S \\):\n\\[ \nS = 3P = 3 \\times 0.47 = 1.41 \n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( B \\):\n\\[ \nB = S + 0.12 = 1.41 + 0.12 = 1.53 \n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, Becca has approximately \\( 1.53 \\) hundred cards, or 153 cards. \n\nI will now open the floor for discussion regarding this solution."
