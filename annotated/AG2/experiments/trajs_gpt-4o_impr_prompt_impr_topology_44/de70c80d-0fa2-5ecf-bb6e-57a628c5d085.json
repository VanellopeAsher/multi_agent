Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Writing the Alphabet in Full Three Times**:\n    - The alphabet consists of 26 letters (A-Z).\n    - Elise writes the entire alphabet three times.\n    - Calculation: \\(26 \\times 3 = 78\\) letters.\n\n2. **Writing Half of the Alphabet Once**:\n    - Half of the alphabet is 13 letters. \n    - Elise writes these 13 letters once.\n    - Calculation: \\(78 + 13 = 91\\) letters written so far.\n\n3. **Re-writing Everything She Has Already Written**:\n    - So far, Elise has written a total of 91 letters.\n    - She re-writes all these 91 letters in their entirety.\n    - Calculation: \\(91 + 91 = 182\\) letters.\n\nTherefore, in total, Elise writes 182 letters. \n\nThis step-by-step breakdown ensures that we accurately account for every letter Elise has written according to the task description."
