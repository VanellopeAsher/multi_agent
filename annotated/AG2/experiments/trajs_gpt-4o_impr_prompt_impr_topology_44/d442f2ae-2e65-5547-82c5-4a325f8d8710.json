John buys 3 goats, each priced at $500:\n   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats x $500/goat = $1500\n\n2. John buys 2 cows, each priced at $1500:\n   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows x $1500/cow = $3000\n\n3. He considers buying a horse for $2000 but decides not to purchase it.\n\nAdding the total cost of goats and cows gives John's total expenditure:\n   - Total spent = $1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500\n\nHence, John spent a total of $4500 at the market. \n\nNow, let's discuss this solution to ensure comprehensiveness and accuracy.
