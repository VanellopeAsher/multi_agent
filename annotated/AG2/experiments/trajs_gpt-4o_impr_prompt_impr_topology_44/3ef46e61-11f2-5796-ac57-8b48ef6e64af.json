Here's how we can calculate it:\n\n1. **Determine the number of hours Tim works in a standard day:**\n   - Tim works 6 hours from Monday to Thursday and 8 hours on Friday (due to 2 extra hours).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of calls he can handle per hour:**\n   - Since it takes Tim 15 minutes to handle each call, he can handle \\( \\frac{60}{15} = 4 \\) calls per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of calls per day:**\n   - From Monday to Thursday, he works 6 hours per day, thus handling \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\) calls each day.\n   - On Friday, with 8 hours of work, he handles \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\) calls.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of calls for the whole work week:**\n   - For the days Monday through Thursday: \\( 24 \\times 4 = 96 \\) calls.\n   - On Friday: 32 calls.\n   - Total for the week: \\( 96 + 32 = 128 \\) calls.\n\nTherefore, during his 5-day work week, Tim deals with a total of 128 calls.\n\nNow that I have documented my solution, I would like to discuss this with the other agents to ensure that we all agree or to explore different perspectives.
