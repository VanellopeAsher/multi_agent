      "content": "**Document Your Solution**\n\nTo solve the problem of determining how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to go through the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Oranges:**\n   Since each box contains 20 oranges, we need to first find out how many boxes Mrs. Harrington originally had. However, this information is missing from the problem statement. For the rest of this solution, let's assume Mrs. Harrington bought \\( x \\) boxes.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Oranges Given Away:**\n   Mrs. Harrington gave away 2 boxes of oranges to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. This means she gave away a total of \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) boxes.\n   - In terms of oranges, she gave away \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\) oranges.\n\n3. **Determine the Remaining Oranges:**\n   After giving away 4 boxes, the remaining number of boxes she has is \\( x - 4 \\).\n   - So, she has \\( (x - 4) \\times 20 \\) oranges left.\n\n4. **Calculate Oranges Mrs. Harrington Kept:**\n   Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. If she has \\( (x - 4) \\times 20 \\) oranges left, she kept \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times (x - 4) \\times 20 = \\frac{(x - 4) \\times 20}{4} = 5 \\times (x - 4) \\) oranges.\n\n5. **Determine Oranges Mrs. Harrington Sold:**\n   The remaining oranges after keeping 1/4 of the remaining ones, she sold \\( (x - 4) \\times 20 - 5 \\times (x - 4) = 15 \\times (x - 4) \\).\n\nTo finalize the solution, you will need to find the value of \\( x \\) which represents the total number of boxes of oranges originally bought by Mrs. Harrington. Once you have that, substitute it into the expression \\( 15 \\times (x - 4) \\) to find the number of oranges sold.\n\n**Engage in Discussion**\n\nI recognize that the solution requires an assumption for \\( x \\), the initial number of boxes. Without a specific number, the exact number of oranges sold cannot be determined. Agent Code Executor, do you have a method to express the final number of oranges sold given the assumption \\( x \\)? Let's discuss how we can conclude the task collaboratively."

      "content": "Certainly! In the absence of a specific number of boxes initially purchased, weâ€™ve approached this problem symbolically with \\( x \\) representing the initial number of boxes. We can demonstrate and verify this solution using SymPy for symbolic manipulation.\n\nLet's compute the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold under given assumptions:\n\n- Using SymPy, let's denote variables and solve symbolically based on \\( x \\).\n\nHere is how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define variable for number of boxes originally bought\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the total number of oranges initially\ntotal_oranges = x * 20\n\n# Calculate the number of oranges given away (4 boxes)\noranges_given_away = 4 * 20\n\n# Calculate the remaining oranges after giving away\nremaining_oranges = total_oranges - oranges_given_away\n\n# Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept (1/4 of remaining)\noranges_kept = remaining_oranges / 4\n\n# Calculate the number of oranges sold\noranges_sold = simplify(remaining_oranges - oranges_kept)\n\nprint(oranges_sold)\n```\n\nThis will output the symbolic expression representing the number of oranges sold. Once the value of \\( x \\) is assumed or determined, plugging it back into `oranges_sold` will yield the exact number of oranges sold.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
