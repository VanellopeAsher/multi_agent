      "content": "To determine the total number of hours Frankie spent watching TV during the week, we'll need to break down his viewing schedule day by day and add it all up. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Monday and Tuesday**:  \n   - Frankie watches 1 hour each night.  \n   - Total for Monday and Tuesday = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\n2. **Wednesday**:  \n   - Frankie watches three 30-minute episodes.  \n   - Since 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, three 30-minute episodes amount to:  \n     \\[ 3 \\times 0.5 = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n3. **Thursday**:  \n   - Frankie watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.  \n   - Total viewing time for Thursday = 1 hour + 0.5 hour (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours.\n\n4. **Friday**:  \n   - Frankie watches two one-hour episodes.  \n   - Total for Friday = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the hours from each day:\n\nTotal viewing time = 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday).\n\nLet's perform the addition:\n\n\\[ \n2 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2  = 7 \\text{ hours} \n\\]\n\nSo, Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours during the week."
