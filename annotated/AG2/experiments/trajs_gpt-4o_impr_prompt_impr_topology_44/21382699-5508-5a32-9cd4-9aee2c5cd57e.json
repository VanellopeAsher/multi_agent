This can be represented as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{D}{A} = \\frac{7}{11}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Express Ages Using Ratio**:\n   - From the ratio, we can express:\n     \\[\n     D = \\frac{7}{11}A\n     \\]\n\n4. **Use Total Age Information**:\n   - We are given that their total age is 162. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     D + A = 162\n     \\]\n\n5. **Substitute and Solve**:\n   - Substitute the expression for \\( D \\) from step 3 into the total age equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7}{11}A + A = 162\n     \\]\n   - Simplify and solve for \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7}{11}A + \\frac{11}{11}A = 162\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{18}{11}A = 162\n     \\]\n   - Multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{11}{18} \\) to solve for \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     A =  162 \\cdot \\frac{11}{18}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     A = 9 \\cdot 11 = 99\n     \\]\n\n6. **Find Allen's Age 10 Years From Now**:\n   - Current age of Allen = 99\n   - 10 years from now, Allen's age will be:\n     \\[\n     99 + 10 = 109\n     \\]\n\nThus, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109 years."
