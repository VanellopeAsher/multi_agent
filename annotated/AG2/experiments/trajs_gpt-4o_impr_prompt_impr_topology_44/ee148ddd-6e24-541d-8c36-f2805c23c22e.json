Given that he watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours, the total time spent watching shows is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ shows} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/show} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n   Since 6 hours account for 30% of the time, we can set up the equation to find the total time spent on activities (\\( T \\)):\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times T = 6\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing**:\n   According to the problem, John spent 40% of his total activity time sightseeing. Thus, the time spent sightseeing is:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 20 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, John spent **8 hours** sightseeing."
