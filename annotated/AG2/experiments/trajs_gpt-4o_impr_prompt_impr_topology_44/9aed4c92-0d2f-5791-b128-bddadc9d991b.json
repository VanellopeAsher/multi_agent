Since he will save all the money he earns:\n\n   \\[ \\text{Daily savings} = 12.5 \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Days Needed**:  \nTo find the number of days Mark needs to work and save to reach the additional amount needed, we divide the additional amount needed by his daily savings:\n\n   \\[ \\text{Number of days needed} = \\frac{\\text{Additional amount needed}}{\\text{Daily savings}} \\]  \n   \\[ = \\frac{250}{12.5} \\]  \n   \\[ = 20 \\]\n\n**Conclusion**: Mark needs to save his income for 20 days to afford the bike."
