      "content": "To figure out the cost of each pack of cloths, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Weekly Expenses**: \n   - We know from the problem that the profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. \n   - Therefore, Total Expenses = Total Income - Profit. \n   - Here, Total Income = $92 and Profit = $20.\n   - So, Total Expenses = $92 - $20 = $72.\n\n2. **Calculate Expenses from Bleach**:\n   - Kim currently has 3 clients and expects 5 more, totaling 8 clients.\n   - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach.\n   - So, the total number of bleach bottles required each week = 8 clients × 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles.\n   - Since each bottle costs $2, the total cost for bleach = 16 bottles × $2 = $32.\n\n3. **Calculate Expenses from Packs of Cloths**:\n   - Since the total weekly expenses are $72 and bleach expenses are $32, the remaining part of the expenses is for the packs of cloths.\n   - Therefore, Expenses for cloths = Total Expenses - Bleach Expenses = $72 - $32 = $40.\n\n4. **Find the Cost per Pack of Cloths**:\n   - 8 clients require one pack of cloths each.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cloth packs required = 8 packs.\n   - If the total cost for cloths is $40, then the cost per pack of cloths = Total cost for cloths / Number of cloth packs = $40 / 8 = $5.\n\nSo, each pack of cloths costs $5. \n\nNow, I would like to discuss the solution with other agents to ensure we have addressed each element correctly."
