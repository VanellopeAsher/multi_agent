Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first aircraft each day as \\( x \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, the second aircraft makes 44 flights to Poland, and these 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n   \\]\n\n3. Solving for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 44 \\times 2 = 88\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total number of flights made by the first aircraft each day is 88.\n\n4. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flights to Greece} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n   \\]\n\n5. The remaining flights are split evenly between France and Germany. Since the total number of flights by the first aircraft is 88 and 66 flights are to Greece:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining Flights} = 88 - 66 = 22\n   \\]\n\n6. These 22 flights are divided evenly between France and Germany, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flights to France} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is 11."
