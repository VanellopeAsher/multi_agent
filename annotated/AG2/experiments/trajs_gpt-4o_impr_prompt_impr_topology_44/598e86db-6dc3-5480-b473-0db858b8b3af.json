      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people Billy helps per hour.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Total Days Billy Works\nWe need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.\n\n- Days in March: 31 days\n- Days in April till 19th: 19 days\n\nTotal days from March 1st to April 19th = 31 + 19 = 50 days\n\n### Step 2: Account for Days Off\nBilly takes 20% of the days off. Therefore, we need to calculate how many days he actually works.\n\n- Total days he takes off: 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days\n- Total working days = 50 - 10 = 40 days\n\n### Step 3: Total People Helped Per Day\nBilly works for 3 hours a day helping people. Let \\( x \\) represent the number of people he helps per hour.\n\nThus, the number of people he helps in one day = \\( 3x \\).\n\n### Step 4: Equate with Total People Helped\nWe know Billy helps 240 people in total. So, for 40 working days:\n\n\\[ 40 \\times 3x = 240 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( x \\)\n\\[ 120x = 240 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{240}{120} = 2 \\]\n\nThus, Billy helps 2 people per hour.\n\n### Conclusion\nBilly helps 2 people per hour. \n\nLet's discuss this approach to ensure its validity or if any improvements can be made, before Agent_Verifier consolidates the findings."
