The number of cards per box is not specified, so we need to assume a missing number here. Let's denote this unknown number of cards per box as \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Total Cards Before Distribution**:\n   - Therefore, the total cards Erica had initially was \\( 20 + 2x \\).\n\n4. **Cards Passed Out**:\n   - Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family. \n   - The total cards passed out = \\( 24 + 5 = 29 \\).\n\n5. **Cards Remaining After Distribution**:\n   - After passing out the cards, the remaining cards would be \\( (20 + 2x) - 29 \\).\n   - Simplifying this, we have \\( 2x - 9 \\).\n\n6. **Cards Received**:\n   - Erica received 17 cards from family and friends.\n\n7. **Final Count of Cards**:\n   - Adding the cards received to the remaining cards, the final number of cards Erica has is:\n     \\[\n     2x - 9 + 17 = 2x + 8\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, without the specific number of cards in each pre-made box, the final number of cards Erica has is expressed as \\( 2x + 8 \\), where \\( x \\) is the number of cards per box.
