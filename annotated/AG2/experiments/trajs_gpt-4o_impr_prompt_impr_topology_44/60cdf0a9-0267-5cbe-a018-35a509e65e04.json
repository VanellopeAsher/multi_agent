Total number of crayons given was 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, amounting to 192 crayons.\n2. Kate created muffin crayons, each using 8 crayons, resulting in \\( \\frac{192}{8} = 24 \\) muffin crayons.\n3. Selling all muffin crayons for $36 gives a price of \\( \\frac{36}{24} = 1.50 \\) per muffin crayon.\n\nThus, the correct price per muffin crayon is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{1.50}**"
