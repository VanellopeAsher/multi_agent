Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of red squares:**\n   - We know there are 14 red squares.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of blue squares:**\n   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.\n   - Number of blue squares = Red squares + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of green squares:**\n   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.\n   - Number of green squares = Blue squares + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.\n\n4. **Determine the total number of colored squares so far:**\n   - Total colored squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares\n   - Total colored squares = 14 + 18 + 24 = 56 squares.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of white squares:**\n   - The comforter is 68 square feet, which means it has 68 squares in total.\n   - Number of white squares = Total squares - Total colored squares\n   - Number of white squares = 68 - 56 = 12 white squares.\n\n6. **Calculate how many fewer white squares there are than green squares:**\n   - Difference = Green squares - White squares\n   - Difference = 24 - 12 = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares."
