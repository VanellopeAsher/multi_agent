Therefore, the total number of biscuits is calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Biscuits} = 10 \\text{ packages} \\times 6 \\text{ biscuits/package} = 60 \\text{ biscuits}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost of Biscuits**: Each biscuit costs $0.10, so we calculate the total cost for all the biscuits:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 60 \\text{ biscuits} \\times \\$0.10/\\text{biscuit} = \\$6.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Change Carl Receives**: Carl pays with a $10 note. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the biscuits from the amount paid:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Change} = \\$10 - \\$6.00 = \\$4.00\n   \\]\n\nThus, Carl should receive $4.00 in change. \n\nNow, I am open to discussing the approach and verifying the solution with Agent_Code_Executor and Agent_Verifier."
