Therefore, the girls brought: \n     \\[\n     60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000 \\text{ shells}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Seashells Brought by Each Girl**:\n   - To find out how many seashells each girl brought, divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{300,000 \\text{ shells}}{100 \\text{ girls}} = 3,000 \\text{ shells/girl}.\n     \\]\n\nThus, each girl brought back 3,000 seashells."

The total number of kids is 200, with an equal number of boys and girls: 100 boys and 100 girls.\n2. Each boy collected 600 seashells, resulting in a total of \\(100 \\times 600 = 60,000\\) seashells for the boys.\n3. The girls collected seashells equal to what the boys collected (60,000), plus four times that amount, leading to \\(60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 300,000\\) seashells.\n4. Dividing the total seashells collected by the girls by the number of girls, we get \\(300,000 \\div 100 = 3,000\\) seashells per girl.\n\nBoth agents independently verified this, and the problem statement has been strictly adhered to without assuming additional variables. The calculations are accurate, and I am confident in the solution.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3000}**"
