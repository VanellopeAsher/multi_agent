Determine the number of balloons thrown by subtracting the balloons left from the total number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of packs and balloons per pack\npacks = 10\nballoons_per_pack = 100\n\n# Calculate total number of balloons\ntotal_balloons = packs * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Balloons left at the end\nballoons_left = 120\n\n# Calculate the number of balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\n# Print the result\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
