      "content": "Let's break down this problem into a few straightforward steps to find the total square footage of fabric that Jim needs. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Calculate the Size of Each Comforter Piece:**\n   - The dimensions of the king-sized bed are given as 6 feet by 8 feet.\n   - Jim wants each piece of fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\n   - Therefore, each piece of fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.\n   - The area of each piece is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.\n\n2. **Determine the Total Area for Two Comforter Pieces:**\n   - Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric for his comforter, the total area for these two pieces is 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area for the Duvet Cover:**\n   - The dimensions for the duvet cover are given as 9 feet long by 11 feet wide.\n   - The area for the duvet cover is 9 feet * 11 feet = 99 square feet.\n\n4. **Sum the Total Area of Fabric Required:**\n   - Add the total area of the two comforter pieces and the duvet cover.\n   - Total fabric needed = 160 square feet + 99 square feet = 259 square feet.\n\nThus, Jim needs to buy a total of 259 square feet of fabric. Now let's discuss or verify this calculation to ensure correctness."
