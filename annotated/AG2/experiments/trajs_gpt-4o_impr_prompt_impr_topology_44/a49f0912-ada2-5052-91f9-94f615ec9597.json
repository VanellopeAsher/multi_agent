Then:  \n   \\[\n   0.30T = 600\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( T \\), we get:  \n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{600}{0.30} = 2000 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Sightseeing Time Calculation**: We need to find 40% of the total time spent, which corresponds to the sightseeing time.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sightseeing Time} = 0.40 \\times 2000 = 800 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nSo, John spent 800 hours sightseeing during his vacation. \n\nLet's discuss this calculation to ensure we haven't missed anything or made any assumptions that need validation."
