So, the time spent swimming is \\(\\frac{6.6}{2} = 3.3\\) hours.\n\n2. **Time spent watching shows:**\n   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2.5 hours.\n   - Total time spent watching shows is \\(3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\) hours.\n\n3. **Total time calculation:**\n   - We know that the time spent watching shows accounts for 30% of his total vacation time.\n   - Let the total time John spent on vacation be \\(T\\).\n   - So, \\(0.3T = 7.5\\).\n\n4. **Solve the equation to find the total time, \\(T\\):**\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} = 25 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing accounted for 40% of his total vacation time.\n   - Time spent sightseeing is \\(0.4T = 0.4 \\times 25 = 10\\) hours.\n\nThus, John spent 10 hours sightseeing during his vacation."
