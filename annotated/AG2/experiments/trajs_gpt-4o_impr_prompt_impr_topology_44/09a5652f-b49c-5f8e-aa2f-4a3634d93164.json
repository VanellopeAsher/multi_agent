      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine John's running speed in miles per hour. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Determine Total Running Distance**: \n   - John runs a total of 60 miles per week.\n\n2. **Distribute Running Distances Across Days**:\n   - John runs for 3 days each week.\n   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. Let's denote his speed as \\( v \\) miles per hour.\n   - On the other two days, he runs half as much time as the first day. So, he runs for \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours on each of these two days.\n\n3. **Formulate Equations for Distance**:\n   - Distance run on the first day: \\( 3v \\)\n   - Distance run on the second and third days: \\( 1.5v \\) for each day\n\n4. **Total Running Distance Equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 6v\n   \\]\n   We know the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. Thus, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   6v = 60\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( v \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides by 6 to find \\( v \\):\n   \\[\n   v = \\frac{60}{6} = 10\n   \\]\n   Therefore, John runs at a speed of \\( 10 \\) miles per hour.\n\n**Conclusion**: Johnâ€™s running speed is 10 miles per hour. \n\nNow, let's engage in discussion to confirm or refine this solution."
