Without this, we cannot complete the calculation. Assuming we have that information, let's refer to this hypothetical length as \"L\" inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - The formula to find the percentage of the shark's body length that corresponds to the combined length of the remoras is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Combined Length of Remoras}}{\\text{Length of Shark}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Plug in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{12}{L}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Note**:\n   - In the absence of the shark's length, we can present the solution formulaically. If \"L\" is provided, just substitute it in the formula above to get the percentage.\n\nPlease let me know if the length of the shark is provided, and we can complete the calculation."
