Without this, we cannot complete the calculation. Assuming we have that information, let's refer to this hypothetical length as \"L\" inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - The formula to find the percentage of the shark's body length that corresponds to the combined length of the remoras is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Combined Length of Remoras}}{\\text{Length of Shark}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Plug in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{12}{L}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Note**:\n   - In the absence of the shark's length, we can present the solution formulaically.
