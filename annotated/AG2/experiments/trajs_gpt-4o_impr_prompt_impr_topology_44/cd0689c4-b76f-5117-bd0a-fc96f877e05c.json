Hereâ€™s the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Presents**:  \n   Monica has presents for three groups:\n   - Family members: 6 presents\n   - Buddies: 4 presents\n   - Educators: 2 presents\n\n   Total number of presents = 6 (family) + 4 (buddies) + 2 (educators) = 12 presents\n\n2. **Calculate the Ribbon Length Allocated per Present**:  \n   Monica has a total of 144 inches of ribbon.\n\n   To find the ribbon length that can be allocated to each present, we divide the total ribbon length by the total number of presents:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ribbon length per present} = \\frac{144 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ presents}} = 12 \\text{ inches per present}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Monica can allocate 12 inches of ribbon for each present's bow.\n\nLet's now discuss this approach with other agents to ensure our solution is correct and comprehensive."
