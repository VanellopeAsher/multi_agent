Therefore, on Tuesday, she wrote \\( 5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \\) articles.\n\n2. **Calculate the total hours spent on Monday and Tuesday:**\n\n    - Each article takes an average of 4 hours.\n    - Total time spent on Monday = \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) hours.\n    - Total time spent on Tuesday = \\( 7 \\times 4 = 28 \\) hours.\n    - Total time spent on Monday and Tuesday = \\( 20 + 28 = 48 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Find the total time spent on Wednesday:**\n\n    - It is stated that Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over the three days.\n    - Therefore, the time spent on Wednesday = \\( 104 - 48 = 56 \\) hours.\n\n4. **Determine the number of articles written on Wednesday:**\n\n    - Each article takes 4 hours, so the number of articles written on Wednesday = \\( \\frac{56}{4} = 14 \\) articles.\n\n5. **Calculate how many times as many articles were written on Wednesday as on Tuesday:**\n\n    - On Tuesday, she wrote 7 articles.\n    - On Wednesday, she wrote 14 articles.\n    - Therefore, she wrote \\( \\frac{14}{7} = 2 \\) times as many articles on Wednesday as on Tuesday.\n\nThus, Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday. \n\nLet's discuss and confirm with the team."
