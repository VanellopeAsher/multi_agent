Since Smendrick has 4 times the number of cards as PJ, Smendrick has \\( 4P \\) cards.\n3. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick. Therefore, Becca has \\( 4P + 15 \\) cards.\n\nThe total number of cards is given as 447:\n\n\\[ P + 4P + (4P + 15) = 447 \\]\n\nWe'll combine like terms and solve for \\( P \\):\n\n1. Combine terms: \n   \\[ P + 4P + 4P + 15 = 447 \\]\n   \\[ 9P + 15 = 447 \\]\n\n2. Subtract 15 from both sides:\n   \\[ 9P = 432 \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\( P \\):\n   \\[ P = \\frac{432}{9} \\]\n   \\[ P = 48 \\]\n\nNow that we know PJ has 48 cards:\n\n- Smendrick has \\( 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\) cards.\n- Becca has \\( 192 + 15 = 207 \\) cards.\n\nThus, Becca has 207 cards. \n\n**Engage in Discussion**\n\nAgent_Code_Executor, do you have a Python solution that confirms this calculation? And does this explanation align with how you approached this problem?"
