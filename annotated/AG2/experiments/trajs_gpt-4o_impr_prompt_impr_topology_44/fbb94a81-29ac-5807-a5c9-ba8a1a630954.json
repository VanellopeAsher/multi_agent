      "content": "To solve this problem, we can employ algebra by defining variables to represent the ages of Peter, Paul, and John. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( P \\) represent Peter's age.\n   - Let \\( A \\) represent Paul's age.\n   - Let \\( J \\) represent John's age.\n\n2. **Set up the equations based on the problem statement**:\n   - We know the combined age of all three individuals is 100 years. So, we have:\n     \\[\n     P + A + J = 100\n     \\]\n   - Paul is 18 years older than John, so:\n     \\[\n     A = J + 18\n     \\]\n   - Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul's and John's age, so:\n     \\[\n     P = A + J\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the equations**:\n   - From the second equation \\( A = J + 18 \\), substitute \\( A \\) in the third equation:\n     \\[\n     P = (J + 18) + J = 2J + 18\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the expression for \\( P \\) and \\( A \\) from above into the first equation:\n     \\[\n     (2J + 18) + (J + 18) + J = 100\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify and Solve for \\( J \\)**:\n   \\[\n   2J + 18 + J + 18 + J = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4J + 36 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4J = 100 - 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4J = 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   J = 16\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find Paul and Peter's age using John's age**:\n   - Use \\( J = 16 \\) to find \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     A = J + 18 = 16 + 18 = 34\n     \\]\n   - Use the values of \\( J \\) and \\( A \\) to find \\( P \\):\n     \\[\n     P = 2J + 18 = 2 \\times 16 + 18 = 32 + 18 = 50\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Peter's age is \\(\\boxed{50}\\) years old.\n\nLet's discuss our findings, and if needed, confirm them with our fellow agents."
