Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the sisters' age**:\n   - All sisters are the same age, and their age is given as 1.6 times of ten.\n   - Age of one sister = 1.6 \\* 10 = 16 years.\n   - Since there are 3 sisters, the combined age of all sisters = 3 \\* 16 = 48 years.\n\n2. **Calculate the younger brother's age**:\n   - The age of one brother is given as 3/5 of 20 years.\n   - Age of the younger brother = (3/5) \\* 20 = 12 years.\n\n3. **Determine the older brother's age**:\n   - It is mentioned that the younger brother's age is half the age of the older brother.\n   - Thus, the age of the older brother = 2 \\* 12 = 24 years.\n\n4. **Calculate the total age of all siblings**:\n   - The total age of all siblings = combined age of sisters + age of younger brother + age of older brother.\n   - Total age = 48 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 84 years.\n\nTherefore, the total age of all siblings is 84 years. \n\nLet's discuss this solution with the other agents to ensure that everything is correctly calculated."
