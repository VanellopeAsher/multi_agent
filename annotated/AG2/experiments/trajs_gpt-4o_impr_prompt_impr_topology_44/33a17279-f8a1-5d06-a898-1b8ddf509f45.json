So, her earnings from cookies are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings from cookies} = 80 \\times 1 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Earnings from Cupcakes**:\n\n   Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each. So, her earnings from cupcakes are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings from cupcakes} = 60 \\times 4 = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Earnings**:\n\n   The total earnings are the sum of earnings from cookies and cupcakes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total earnings} = 80 + 240 = 320 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Expenses**:\n\n   Suzanne gave $10 each to her two sisters (2 sisters) and donated $15 to charity. The total expenses are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expenses} = (2 \\times 10) + 15 = 20 + 15 = 35 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Money Left**:\n\n   To find out how much money Suzanne has left, subtract the total expenses from the total earnings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money left} = 320 - 35 = 285 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Suzanne has $285 left from her earnings."
