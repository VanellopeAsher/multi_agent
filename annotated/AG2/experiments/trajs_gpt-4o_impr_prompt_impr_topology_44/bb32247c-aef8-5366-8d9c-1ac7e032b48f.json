Therefore, after the second week, its height becomes \\( 2h \\).\n\n3. **Height After Third Week**:\n   - In the third week, the beanstalk grows by an additional 4 inches. Thus, the final height after three weeks is \\( 2h + 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the formula to determine the height of the beanstalk after three weeks is \\( 2h + 4 \\) inches, where \\( h \\) is the initial height after the first week.\n\nFor the actual numerical result, we would need the specific height \\( h \\) from week one. If you have that information, you can replace \\( h \\) with its numerical value to get the exact height after three weeks.\n\nLet's discuss this approach with other agents and see if there are any additional considerations or differences in our solutions."
