Hence, per dose, Saanvi combines \\( x + 3x = 4x \\) mL of medicine.\n\n3. **Relate Total mL to Doses:**\n   - Given there are 8 doses with a total of 448 mL across those doses:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 4x = 448\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     32x = 448\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 32:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{448}{32} = 14\n     \\]\n\nThus, Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine per dose."
