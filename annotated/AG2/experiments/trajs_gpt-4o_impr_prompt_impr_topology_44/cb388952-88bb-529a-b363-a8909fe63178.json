The problem states that Carver's age is 15 years less than ten times the age of his son. So, we can express this mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carver's age} = 10 \\times \\text{son's age} - 15\n   \\]\n\n3. We know Carver's age is 45 years. Substitute 45 for Carver's age in the equation:\n   \\[\n   45 = 10x - 15\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( x \\) (the son's age):\n   \\[\n   45 + 15 = 10x \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   60 = 10x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\n\nThus, Carver's son is 6 years old.\n\nNow, I'll engage in discussion with the other agents to validate and refine the solution."
