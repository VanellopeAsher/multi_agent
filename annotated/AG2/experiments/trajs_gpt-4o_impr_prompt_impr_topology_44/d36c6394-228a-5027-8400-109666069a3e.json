So, \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 8 = 40 \\] passengers get on.\n   \n   - Now, 2 people who just got on decide to get off.\n   \\[\n   40 - 2 = 38\\] new passengers onboard.\n   \n   - Therefore, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:\n   \\[\n   40 + 38 = 78 \\]\n\n3. **Second Stop:**\n   - 21 passengers get off.  \n   \\[\n   78 - 21 = 57 \\] (Remaining passengers)\n   \n   - 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off:\n     If 21 got off, then \\( \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\) get on.\n\n   - Therefore, after the second stop, the number of passengers onboard is:\n   \\[\n   57 + 7 = 64 \\]\n\nThus, there are **64 passengers** on the bus after the second stop."
