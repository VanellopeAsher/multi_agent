      "content": "To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left from the entire day, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Brownies Greta Made:**\n   - Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.\n\n2. **Determine the Brownies from Her Office Party:**\n   - At her office, Greta was given 1/2 a dozen brownies. So, 1/2 dozen equals 6 brownies.\n\n3. **Determine the Brownies from the Surprise Party:**\n   - For the surprise party at home, there were 4 dozen brownies. Since 4 dozen equals 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Brownies Before Any Were Eaten:**\n   - Add the brownies from each source:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ (from Greta)} + 6 \\text{ (from office)} + 48 \\text{ (from surprise party)} = 66 \\text{ brownies}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Subtract the Brownies Eaten During the Party:**\n   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 dozen equals 18 brownies (1.5 * 12), we subtract those from the total:\n     \\[\n     66 \\text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \\text{ (eaten)} = 48 \\text{ brownies left}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
