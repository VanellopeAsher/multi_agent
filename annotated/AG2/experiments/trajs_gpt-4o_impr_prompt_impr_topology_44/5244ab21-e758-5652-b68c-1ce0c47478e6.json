The number of oranges in these 4 boxes is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ oranges/box} = 80 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Oranges After Gifting:**\n   - The remaining oranges after gifting are:\n     \\[\n     240 \\text{ oranges} - 80 \\text{ oranges} = 160 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Oranges Kept for Herself:**\n   - She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself. Thus, the oranges she kept are:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 \\text{ oranges} = 40 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Oranges Sold:**\n   - The number of oranges sold is the remaining oranges after keeping some for herself:\n     \\[\n     160 \\text{ oranges} - 40 \\text{ oranges} = 120 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Harrington sold **120 oranges**. \n\nNow, I will engage in a discussion with the other agents to validate this calculation and ensure the accuracy of the approach."
