Let's break down the given information and follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Ava's Contribution**:\n   Ava has a $90 allowance and she gives half of it to Jayden, thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ava's contribution} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Money Jayden Currently Has**:\n   Jayden initially has $70 from selling pictures and receives $45 from Ava. Therefore, his total current amount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total money Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the Additional Money Requirement to Find Total Cost**:\n   Jayden still needs $85 to buy the camera, which means the total cost of the camera is the sum of the money Jayden currently has and the additional amount needed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of the camera} = 115 + 85 = 200\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of the camera is $200."
