Let's denote the number of packs filled as \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Establish the Total Balloons Used**:\n   - The total number of balloons filled initially is given by the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Balloons} = 30 \\times n\n   \\]\n   - Since 12 balloons are left at the end of the afternoon, the number of balloons thrown can be calculated by subtracting the balloons left from the total filled: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Thrown} = (30 \\times n) - 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Discussion**: \n   - To provide a precise answer, we would need to know the number of packs (\\( n \\)) Jolene and her friends filled initially. \n   - Without the number of packs, we cannot compute the exact number of balloons thrown but can represent the solution as a formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Thrown} = 30n - 12\n   \\]\n\nPlease clarify the number of packs filled if a specific numerical answer is required."

Since we don't have the specific number \\( n \\) of packs, you'll need to plug in the value for \\( n \\) if known.

Here is a synthesis of the proposed solutions:\n\n1. **Agent Problem Solver** emphasized that to calculate the number of balloons thrown, we need the number of packs \\( n \\), since each pack contains 30 balloons. The formula presented is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Thrown} = 30n - 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor** used the formula in a Python code, assuming \\( n = 5 \\) (an example value) and calculated that 138 balloons were thrown using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Thrown} = 30 \\times 5 - 12 = 150 - 12 = 138\n   \\]\n\nHowever, without explicit knowledge of the number of packs \\( n \\), we cannot definitively calculate the answer. Since the number of packs is not provided in the problem statement, the solution cannot be determined numerically.\n\nThus, the correct solution based on available information is:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
