Joey's initial score is 214 points. Let's denote the points he scores on his turn as \\( x \\). After his turn, Joey's score becomes \\( 214 + x \\).\n\n2. Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores 10 points on her turn. Therefore, after her turn, her score becomes \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\).\n\n3. To find out by how many points Joey is winning after both turns, we calculate the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Joey's score} - \\text{Marcy's score} = (214 + x) - 235\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, Joey is winning by \\( (214 + x) - 235 \\) points.\n\nTo find the explicit number of points by which Joey is winning, you need to provide the value of \\( x \\), the points Joey scored on his turn. Once I have that information, I can compute the exact point difference."
