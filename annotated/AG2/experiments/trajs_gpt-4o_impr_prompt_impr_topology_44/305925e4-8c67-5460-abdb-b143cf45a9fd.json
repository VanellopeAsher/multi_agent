Joey's initial score is 214 points. Let's denote the points he scores on his turn as \\( x \\). After his turn, Joey's score becomes \\( 214 + x \\).\n\n2. Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores 10 points on her turn. Therefore, after her turn, her score becomes \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\).\n\n3. To find out by how many points Joey is winning after both turns, we calculate the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Joey's score} - \\text{Marcy's score} = (214 + x) - 235\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, Joey is winning by \\( (214 + x) - 235 \\) points.\n\nTo find the explicit number of points by which Joey is winning, you need to provide the value of \\( x \\), the points Joey scored on his turn. Once I have that information, I can compute the exact point difference."

Without knowing the exact points Joey scored, we can only provide this as an expression. If you have additional information or constraints, we can calculate the exact points using the above formula."
