Therefore, the revenue from large stuffed animals is \\( 120L \\).\n   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Hence, we can express this relationship as \\( S = 2L \\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Revenue Equation**:\n   - The total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is given as $1200.\n   - Therefore, the equation based on revenue is: \n     \\[\n     40S + 120L = 1200\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute and Solve**:\n   - Substitute the relationship \\( S = 2L \\) into the revenue equation:\n     \\[\n     40(2L) + 120L = 1200\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     80L + 120L = 1200\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     200L = 1200\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the Number of Small Stuffed Animals Sold**:\n   - Since \\( S = 2L \\):\n     \\[\n     S = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n     \\]\n\nThus, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."
