We know the quilt's total area is 101 square feet, and we have the area contributions from medium and large shirts. We need to solve for the small shirts. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the area contributed by the medium shirts**:  \n   Each medium shirt contributes 4 square feet, and Octavia used 8 of them:  \n   \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\) square feet.\n\n2. **Calculate the area contributed by the large shirts**:  \n   Each large shirt contributes 6 square feet, and Octavia used 6 of them:  \n   \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\) square feet.\n\n3. **Compute the remaining area to be covered by small shirts**:  \n   The total fabric area is 101 square feet, so we subtract the area from the medium and large shirts from this total:  \n   \\( 101 - (32 + 36) = 101 - 68 = 33 \\) square feet.\n\n4. **Determine the number of small shirts used**:  \n   Each small shirt contributes 3 square feet, so we divide the remaining area by the area contributed by one small shirt:  \n   \\( \\frac{33}{3} = 11 \\).\n\nTherefore, Octavia used 11 small shirts to make the quilt.\n\nLet's engage in discussion to confirm or refine this solution."
