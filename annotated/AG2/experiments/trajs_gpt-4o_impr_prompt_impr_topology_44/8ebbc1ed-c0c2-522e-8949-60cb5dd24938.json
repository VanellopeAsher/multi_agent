  "problem": "A math teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk to write equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher is environmentally conscious and tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. However, on Monday, the teacher had to conduct an extra class for his students who needed additional help. As a result, he ended up using 45% of the chalk, which was 1.5 times more than his usual consumption. He also noticed that the chalk weighed 0.5 ounces, but this didn't affect his usage. Given that the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches and he plans to return to his usual 20% usage per day, how many days does he have before he needs to recycle this piece of chalk?",

      "content": "To determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk under normal conditions (i.e., using 20% of the chalk each day), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Initial Usage**:\n   - On Monday, due to the extra class, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk.\n   - Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Chalk Used on Monday} = \\frac{45}{100} \\times 5 = 2.25 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - After Monday, the remaining length of the chalk is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Chalk Length} = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Daily Usage**:\n   - Normally, the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.\n   - Calculate the amount of chalk used per day (20% of the initial chalk length, which is 5 inches):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Daily Chalk Usage} = \\frac{20}{100} \\times 5  = 1 \\text{ inch/day}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Usable Days**:\n   - The teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, so we need to determine how many full days of using 1 inch of chalk per day the teacher can get before the chalk is less than or equal to 2 inches.\n   - Start with 2.75 inches on Tuesday and each day use 1 inch:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Day 1: } 2.75 \\text{ inches} - 1 \\text{ inch} = 1.75 \\text{ inches (not enough to use the next day)}\n     \\]\n\nSince the chalk will reduce to 1.75 inches after just the first regular day of usage (Tuesday), the teacher is unable to continue as the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches. Therefore, with his current 20% usage per day strategy after Monday, he will find on Tuesday that he cannot complete the day's usage, effectively indicating zero more full days left following Monday.\n\nIn summary, the teacher can only continue writing on Tuesday with the chalk left from Monday but won't complete the day with a full inch of use because he would drop below the 2-inch threshold. Therefore, effectively, he will write fully only on Monday under his normal strategy before approaching the recyclability threshold."
