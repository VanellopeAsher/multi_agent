Let's go through the calculations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Depth on Monday**:  \n   The initial depth of the water tank on Monday is 17 feet.\n\n2. **Rise on Tuesday**:  \n   On Tuesday, the water level rises by an additional 7 feet.  \n   Therefore, the depth on Tuesday will be:  \n   \\( 17\\, \\text{feet} + 7\\, \\text{feet} = 24\\, \\text{feet} \\).\n\n3. **Decrease on Wednesday**:  \n   By Wednesday, the water level decreases to two thirds of the Tuesday's depth.  \n   Two thirds of the Tuesday's depth will be:  \n   \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24\\, \\text{feet} = \\frac{48}{3}\\, \\text{feet} = 16\\, \\text{feet} \\).\n\nSo, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet."
