Claire consumes 3 eggs every day.\n2. That amounts to \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) eggs per week.\n3. Over 12 weeks, that totals \\(21 \\times 12 = 252\\) eggs.\n4. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, \\(252 \\div 12 = 21\\) dozens.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is confirmed to be correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{21}**"
