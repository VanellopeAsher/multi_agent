From Sahir's house, the angle with the ground is 32 degrees.\n\n2. **Sun's Movement**: \n    - For 10 hours, the sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.\n    - After this, the sun moves at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for 2 more hours.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Movement**:\n    - In the first 10 hours:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Degrees moved in 10 hours} = 10 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 5 \\, \\text{degrees/hour} = 50 \\, \\text{degrees}\n      \\]\n    - In the next 2 hours:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Degrees moved in 2 hours} = 2 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 3 \\, \\text{degrees/hour} = 6 \\, \\text{degrees}\n      \\]\n\n4. **Total Movement of the Sun**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Total Degrees Moved} = 50 \\, \\text{degrees} + 6 \\, \\text{degrees} = 56 \\, \\text{degrees}\n    \\]\n\n5. **Angle from Ground to the Sun**:\n  - Initially, the angle is 32 degrees.\n  - Add the total movement of the sun to the initial angle:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Final Angle} = 32 \\, \\text{degrees} + 56 \\, \\text{degrees} = 88 \\, \\text{degrees}\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, after 12 hours, the sun would be at an angle of 88 degrees from the ground as viewed from Sahir's house."
