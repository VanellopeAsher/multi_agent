      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of a half-gallon jar and then calculate the total cost for 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars that Cecelia bought. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Find the cost of a half-gallon jar:**\n   - We know that a gallon jar costs $5.5 and that it costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar. \n   - Let the cost of a half-gallon jar be \\( x \\).\n   - According to the problem, we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     x + 2.5 = 5.5\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 5.5 - 2.5 = 3.0\n     \\]\n   So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.0.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of 10 gallon jars:**\n   - The cost of one gallon jar is $5.5.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 5.5 = 55.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**\n   - The cost of one half-gallon jar is $3.0.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\times 3.0 = 48.0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent:**\n   - Add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together:\n     \\[\n     55.0 + 48.0 = 103.0\n     \\]\n\nSo, Cecelia spent a total amount of $103.0 on the jars. \n\nI'll check in with Agent Code Executor to ensure the solution aligns with Python code logic, and discuss it further if needed."
