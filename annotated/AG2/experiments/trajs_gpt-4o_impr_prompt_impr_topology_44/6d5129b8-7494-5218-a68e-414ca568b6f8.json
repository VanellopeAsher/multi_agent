We are told that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years.\n\n2. To find Charmaine's current age, we subtract the 12 years from the age that she will be in 12 years:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Charmaine's current age} = 16 - 12 = 4 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we need to find out her age after 4 years from now. We add these 4 years to her current age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Charmaine's age after 4 years} = 4 + 4 = 8 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Charmaine will be 8 years old after 4 years."
