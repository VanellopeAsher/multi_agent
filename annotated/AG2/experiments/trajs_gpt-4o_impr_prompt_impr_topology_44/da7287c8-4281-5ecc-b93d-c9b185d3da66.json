Calculate the earnings from burger platters:\n   - Price per burger platter: $11.5\n   - Number of burger platters sold: 9\n\n3. Calculate the earnings from sodas:\n   - Price per soda: $1.50\n   - Number of sodas sold: Half of 40 = 20\n\nThen, sum up all these earnings to get the total money Terry makes.\n\n```python\n# Prices and quantities\nmilkshake_price = 5.50\nburger_platter_price = 11.50\nsoda_price = 1.50\n\nmilkshakes_sold = 6\nburger_platters_sold = 9\nsodas_sold = 40 / 2  # Half of 40 sodas\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = (milkshake_price * milkshakes_sold) + \\\n                 (burger_platter_price * burger_platters_sold) + \\\n                 (soda_price * sodas_sold)\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
