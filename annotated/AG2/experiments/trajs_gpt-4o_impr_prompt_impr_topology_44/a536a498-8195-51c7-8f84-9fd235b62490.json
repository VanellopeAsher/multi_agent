Let's denote the actual audience size as \\( x \\). Kelly claims that the actual audience size was 40 people. Therefore:\n\n\\[ x = 40 \\]\n\nCourtney's reported number is an overstatement by 20%. This means that Courtney's count \\( C \\) is 120% of the actual number. In mathematical terms, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[ C = x + 0.2x = 1.2x \\]\n\nSubstitute the value of \\( x \\) (40 people) into the equation:\n\n\\[ C = 1.2 \\times 40 = 48 \\]\n\nThus, according to Courtney, the audience size was 48 people."
