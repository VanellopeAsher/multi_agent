Thus, hours worked on Wednesday = \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) hours.\n   - **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday. Therefore, hours worked on Thursday = \\( 10 - 2 = 8 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the total hours worked over the three days**:\n   - Total Hours = Hours on Tuesday + Hours on Wednesday + Hours on Thursday\n   - Total Hours = \\( 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \\) hours\n\nThus, Bruce worked a total of 23 hours over the three days."
