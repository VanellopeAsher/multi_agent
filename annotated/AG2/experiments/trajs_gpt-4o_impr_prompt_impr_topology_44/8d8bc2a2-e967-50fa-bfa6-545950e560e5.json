      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the dental work and then calculate how many hours George needs to work to cover this cost, accounting for his current deposit. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Implants:**\n   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.5.\n   - Since George needs 2 implants, the base cost for both implants is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2000.5 = 4001\n     \\]\n\n2. **Add the Additional Cost for the Porcelain Crown:**\n   - The cost of adding a porcelain crown to one implant is $500.5.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the implants including the porcelain crown is:\n     \\[\n     4001 + 500.5 = 4501.5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the Deposit:**\n   - George has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining balance is:\n     \\[\n     4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Hours George Needs to Work:**\n   - George earns $15.3 per hour.\n   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to pay the remaining balance of $3901.5, we divide the balance by his hourly wage:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3901.5}{15.3} \\approx 255\n     \\]\n\nGeorge needs to work approximately 255 hours to have enough money to pay for his dental work after accounting for the deposit he already made."

Dividing the remaining balance by George's hourly wage to determine the number of hours he needs to work.\n\nThe calculations were made as follows:\n\n- Total base cost for 2 implants: \\(2 \\times 2000.5 = 4001\\)\n- Total cost including the porcelain crown: \\(4001 + 500.5 = 4501.5\\)\n- Remaining balance after subtracting the deposit: \\(4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5\\)\n- Number of hours needed: \\(\\frac{3901.5}{15.3} = 255\\)\n\nThus, the final solution is correct: George needs to work approximately **255 hours**.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{255}**"
