Walter collects $500 from neighbors.\n2. Walter collects $1500 from an online fund.\n\nSo, the total amount Walter collects from his neighbors and the online fund is:\n\\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \\]\n\nWalter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer donates:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2000 = 6000 \\]\n\nWalter's lawyer contributed a total of $6600. This includes the $6000 based on the other donations and an additional amount from Walter's friend. Let's find out how much Walter's friend gave him:\n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the money Walter's friend gave him. The lawyer gave $600 more than 3 times the collected amount, which accounts for the friend's donation:\n\\[ 6000 + x = 6600 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 6600 - 6000 \\]\n\\[ x = 600 \\]\n\nThus, Walter's friend gave him $600."
