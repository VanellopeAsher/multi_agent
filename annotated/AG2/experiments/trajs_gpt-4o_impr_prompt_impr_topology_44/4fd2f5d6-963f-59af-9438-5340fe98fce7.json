Would you like any clarifications or have other details to provide?"

However, without further data, the final monetary cost couldn't be specified.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor** took this algebraic approach into Python code using symbolic computation with SymPy. The code confirms that the reduced cost is \\(0.8 \\times \\text{original\\_cost}\\) and savings are \\(0.2 \\times \\text{original\\_cost}\\).\n\nBoth agents have arrived at the same algebraic relationships, which provide an understanding of how savings affect the cost. Since no numerical values are given in the original problem, the best representation is to keep the solution in algebraic terms.\n\nGiven that we lack sufficient numerical details to conclude beyond the algebraic expressions, we will follow the procedure for scenarios with missing information:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
