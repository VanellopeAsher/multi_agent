      "content": "To solve this problem, let’s proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Students Playing Tennis:**\n    - The problem states that there are 6 students playing tennis.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Students Playing Volleyball:**\n    - It states that twice the number of students who play tennis are playing volleyball.\n    - Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Students Playing Soccer:**\n    - The problem states that there are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. However, it doesn’t provide the number of boys.\n    - Let’s denote the number of boys as \\( b \\).\n    - Then, the total number of students playing soccer is \\( b + 22 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Students:**\n    - Summing up all the students in the different groups gives us the total number of students.\n    - Thus, the total number of students is:\n      \\[\n      6 \\, (\\text{Tennis}) + 12 \\, (\\text{Volleyball}) + (b + 22) \\, (\\text{Soccer})\n      \\]\n    - Simplifying this expression, the total number of students is \\( 18 + b + 22 \\).\n    - Therefore, the total number of students is \\( 40 + b \\).\n\nThe solution depends on the number of boys, \\( b \\), playing soccer. If we have additional information regarding the number of boys, we can provide an exact number of total students. As it stands, the solution is dependent on this variable, \\( b \\)."
