      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to consider the constraints and details provided:\n\n1. **Distributing the Total Money**: Peter has a total of $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day over the course of one week (7 days). Therefore, the amount of money he will spend each day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily spending} = \\frac{\\$70}{7} = \\$10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Purchasing Wooden Action Figures**: From Sunday through Wednesday (4 days), Peter buys wooden action figures at a cost of $5 each. Thus, the number of wooden figures he can purchase per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wooden figures per day} = \\frac{\\$10}{\\$5} = 2\n   \\]\n   Over 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday), the total number of wooden action figures is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wooden figures} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Purchasing Plastic Action Figures**: From Thursday to Saturday (3 days), he buys plastic action figures at a cost of $2.5 each. So, the number of plastic figures he can purchase per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Plastic figures per day} = \\frac{\\$10}{\\$2.5} = 4\n   \\]\n   Over 3 days (Thursday to Saturday), the total number of plastic action figures is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total plastic figures} = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Number of Action Figures**: \n   Add both the wooden and plastic figures to get the overall total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total action figures} = 8 \\, (\\text{wooden}) + 12 \\, (\\text{plastic}) = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 20 action figures. \n\nLet's discuss if we have any other perspectives or calculations."
