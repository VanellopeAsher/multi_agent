      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by Samwell's appliance store. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction of Each TV type Sold**:\n   - Smart TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the sales\n   - Analog TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of the sales\n   - Projection TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the sales\n   - OLED TVs: the rest of the sales\n\n2. **Calculate the Combined Fraction of Smart, Analog, and Projection TVs**:\n   - To find the fraction of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the combined fraction of the other three types.\n   - Adding the fractions:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{5} \n     \\]\n   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 8, and 5 is 40.\n   - Convert each fraction:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10}{40}, \\quad \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{5}{40}, \\quad \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{8}{40}\n     \\] \n   - Add the fractions with the common denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{40} + \\frac{5}{40} + \\frac{8}{40} = \\frac{23}{40}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Fraction of OLED TVs Sold**:\n   - The fraction of OLED TVs is the remainder of the total fraction (which is 1, since fractions are parts of a whole):\n     \\[\n     1 - \\frac{23}{40} = \\frac{17}{40}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of OLED TVs Sold**:\n   - Since 40 TVs were sold in total, multiply the fraction of OLED TVs by the total number of TVs:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{17}{40} \\times 40 = 17\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Samwell sold 17 OLED TVs."
