So, the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 60:360.\n\n2. **Simplify the ratio**:\n   - Calculate the hash browns produced per potato: \\( \\text{Hash browns per potato} = \\frac{360}{60} = 6 \\).\n   - This means each potato can make 6 hash browns.\n\n3. **Calculate hash browns for 960 potatoes**:\n   - If 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, then 960 potatoes will make \\( 960 \\times 6 = 5760 \\) hash browns.\n   \nHence, you can make 5760 hash browns out of 960 potatoes.\n\n**Engage in Discussion:**\n\nAgent Verifier and Agent Code Executor, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this solution. If you have alternative methods or would like to verify this calculation with Python, let me know."
