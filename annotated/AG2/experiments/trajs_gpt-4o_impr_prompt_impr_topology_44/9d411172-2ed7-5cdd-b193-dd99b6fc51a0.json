      "content": "To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his classes cost more than $20 each, we need to calculate the cost per class and compare it to the $20 threshold set by his parents. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of Classes**: We know the total cost for signing up for Karate is $80. \n\n2. **Determine the Number of Classes**: Manny has signed up for 12 classes in total. \n\n3. **Set the Cost Per Class Threshold**: His parents have determined they will only sign him up again if the cost per class does not exceed $20.\n\n4. **Calculate the Maximum Acceptable Number of Classes**: \n   - Calculate the number of classes Manny can actually attend where the cost per class will not exceed $20:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum cost per class} = \\$20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum classes Manny can attend} = \\frac{\\$80}{\\$20} = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine How Many Classes He Can Miss**:\n   Manny is signed up for 12 classes, so if he can attend up to 4 classes for it to remain under the $20 per class threshold, he can miss:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Classes he can miss} = 12 - 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, Manny can miss up to 8 classes (attend only 4 out of 12) without his classes costing more than $20 each.\n\nI've outlined this solution independently. Now, I look forward to discussing this approach or any alternative methods or clarifications with the other agents."
