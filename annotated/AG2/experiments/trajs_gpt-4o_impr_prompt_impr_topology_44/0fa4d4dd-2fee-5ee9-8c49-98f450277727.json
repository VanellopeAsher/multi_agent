If the division isn't exact, taking the ceiling ensures Sara earns at least the amount needed."

Added Sara's initial savings ($100) and her earnings from babysitting ($50 from 10 sessions at $5 each), totaling $150 in savings.\n3. Determined that Sara needed an additional $170 ($320 - $150) to purchase the jacket and shoes.\n4. Calculated that Sara must mow the lawn 17 times to earn the remaining $170, as she earns $10 per mowing session.\n\nSince both solutions align and are consistent with the given problem statement and no assumptions were made, the final solution can be stated as:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{17}**"
