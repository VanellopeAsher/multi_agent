Before the pigeons ate their 9, the total was \\( 18 + 9 = 27 \\).\n\nThus, before the pigeons:  \n- There were 27 fries. Before the seagull ate 7 fries, the total number would have been \\( 27 + 7 = 34 \\).\n\nThus, before the seagull:  \n- There were 34 fries, including the amount Dave had eaten, which was 14 fries. \n\nTherefore, the initial quantity of fries was \\( 34 + 14 = 48 \\).\n\nSo the initial quantity of french fries in the packet that Dave purchased was 48."
