Calculate 20% of 50 days:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Days off} = 50 \\times 0.20 = 10 \\text{ days}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Billy Works:**\n\n    - Subtract the days off from the total number of days:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Working days} = 50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ days}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of People Billy Helps Daily:**\n\n    - Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours each day:\n    \\[\n    \\text{People helped per day} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ people/day}\n    \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of People Helped:**\n\n    - Multiply the number of people helped per day by the number of working days:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Total people helped} = 6 \\times 40 = 240 \\text{ people}\n    \\]\n\nThus, Billy helps a total of 240 people during his volunteering period. \n\n**Note:** Information about breaks and caffeine intake is not relevant to the calculation of the number of people helped, so it's not factored into these computations."
