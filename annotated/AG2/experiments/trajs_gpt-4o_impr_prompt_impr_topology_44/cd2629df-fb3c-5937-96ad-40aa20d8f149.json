Stephen borrowed $300 and agreed to pay an additional 2% interest. Therefore, the interest is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest} = 0.02 \\times 300 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. The total amount he needs to repay, including the interest, is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total to repay} = 300 + 6 = 306\n   \\]\n\n3. Over the first 11 months, Stephen pays $25 each month:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Payments over 11 months} = 25 \\times 11 = 275\n   \\]\n\n4. The remaining balance to be paid in the twelfth month is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining payment} = 306 - 275 = 31\n   \\]\n\nThus, Stephen will pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{31}**"
