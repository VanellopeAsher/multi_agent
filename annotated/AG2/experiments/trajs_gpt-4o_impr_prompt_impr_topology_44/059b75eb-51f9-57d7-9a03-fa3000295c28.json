Therefore, on the second day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume on Day 2} = 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Day 3 - Additional Water**: On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow. Therefore, the total volume on the third day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume on Day 3} = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total volume of water flowing through the point of the river on the third day is 14,000 gallons."
