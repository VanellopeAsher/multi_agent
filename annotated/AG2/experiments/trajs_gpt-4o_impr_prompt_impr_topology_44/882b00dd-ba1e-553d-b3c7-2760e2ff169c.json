      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate Billy and Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work and then determine the difference in their earnings.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n**1. Calculate Billy's Current Hourly Rate:**\n\n- Billy's starting hourly rate was $10.00.\n- After 2 months, his salary increased by $0.50 per hour, making his hourly rate $10.50.\n- On his first anniversary (12 months), he received an additional raise of $1.00 per hour.\n\nSo, Billy's current hourly rate after 12 months is:\n\\[ 10 + 0.50 + 1.00 = \\$11.50 \\]\n\n**2. Calculate Sally's Current Hourly Rate:**\n\n- Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, making it $10.50.\n- After 2 months, Sally's salary increased by $0.50 per hour.\n\nSally's current hourly rate after 2 months is:\n\\[ 10.50 + 0.50 = \\$11.00 \\]\n\n**3. Calculate Billy's Earnings for 20 Hours:**\n\nBilly earns:\n\\[ 20 \\times 11.50 = \\$230.00 \\]\n\n**4. Calculate Sally's Earnings for 20 Hours:**\n\nSally earns:\n\\[ 20 \\times 11.00 = \\$220.00 \\]\n\n**5. Calculate the Difference:**\n\nThe difference in their earnings is:\n\\[ 230 - 220 = \\$10.00 \\]\n\nThus, Billy earns $10.00 more than Sally for 20 hours of work. \n\nIf there are any queries or further details needed, feel free to reach out! Otherwise, we can engage in discussion to confirm or refine this solution."
