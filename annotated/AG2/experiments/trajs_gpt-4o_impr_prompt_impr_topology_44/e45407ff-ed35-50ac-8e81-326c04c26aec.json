      "content": "To solve this problem, I'll go step-by-step:\n\n1. **Find the Cost per Bottle of Scotch**:  \n   John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \\frac{600}{10} = 60 \n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Cost Per Bottle of Cognac**:  \n   The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \\times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Bottles of Cognac Purchased**:  \n   John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch. Thus, he buys:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cognac bottles} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Cost for Cognac**:  \n   Now, calculate the total cost for the cognac:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \\times 90 = 1800 \n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Spending on Both Scotch and Cognac**:  \n   Finally, we will calculate how much John spends on everything by adding the cost of scotch and cognac:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spending} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \n   \\]\n\nThus, John spends a total of $2400 on scotch and cognac. \n\nI am ready to discuss these steps and conclusions, and I'm open to any adjustments or further analysis if needed."
