      "content": "To determine the total sum of money Cecelia expended, let's follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Price of Jars:**\n   - According to the problem, the price of a one-gallon jar is $5.\n   - It's also mentioned that a one-gallon jar is priced $2 higher than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Price of one-gallon jar} = \\text{Price of half-gallon jar} + 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     5 = \\text{Price of half-gallon jar} + 2\n     \\]\n   - Solving the equation, we find that the price of a half-gallon jar is $3.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - Cecelia bought 10 jars of one-gallon. The cost of one one-gallon jar is $5. Therefore, the cost for 10 one-gallon jars is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n   - She also bought 16 jars of half-gallon. The cost of one half-gallon jar is $3. Therefore, the cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\times 3 = 48 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Summing Up the Total Expense:**\n   - Add up the costs for both types of jars to get the total amount Cecelia expended:\n     \\[\n     50 + 48 = 98 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Cecelia expended a total of $98 on her purchase."
