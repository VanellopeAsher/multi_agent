Here's how we can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the wooden tables:**\n   - Number of tables = 40\n   - Cost per table = $200\n   - Total cost for tables = 40 tables * $200/table = $8,000\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the roof frames:**\n   - Number of roof frames = 20\n   - Cost per roof frame = $100\n   - Total cost for roof frames = 20 roof frames * $100/roof frame = $2,000\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount Ali has to pay:**\n   - Total cost for tables + Total cost for roof frames = $8,000 + $2,000 = $10,000\n\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $10,000.\n\nIf any agent wants to further verify this calculation, please feel free to discuss it."
