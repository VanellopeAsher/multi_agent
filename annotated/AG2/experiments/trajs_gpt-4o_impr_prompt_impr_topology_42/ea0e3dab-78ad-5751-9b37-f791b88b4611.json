Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the Monthly Charges for the First Half of the Year**:\n   - Aleena pays $200 per month for the first 6 months (January to June).\n   - Calculating the total for these 6 months:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 200 = 1200 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Monthly Charges for the Second Half of the Year**:\n   - The company charges 15% less for the last 6 months (July to December).\n   - A 15% reduction means Aleena pays 85% of the initial amount.\n   - New monthly charge:  \n     \\[\n     200 \\times 0.85 = 170 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total for the Second Half of the Year**:\n   - Calculating the total for the last 6 months:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 170 = 1020 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total for the Entire Year**:\n   - Add the totals from the first and second halves of the year together:  \n     \\[\n     1200 + 1020 = 2220 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\nThus, by the end of the year, Aleena would have paid a total of \\$\\(\\mathbf{2220}\\) for her streaming service subscription."
