We need to determine how these 40 TVs are distributed among the different types according to the given fractions, and then find out how many OLED TVs were sold.\n\nWe know:\n- One-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{4}x\\)\n- One-eighth are analog TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{8}x\\)\n- One-fifth are projection TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{5}x\\)\n- The rest are OLED TVs\n\nTo find out how many OLED TVs there are, we need to first calculate the total number of non-OLED TVs, and then subtract that from the total number of TVs sold. Let's proceed with the calculations in code.\n\n```python\n# Total number of TVs sold\ntotal_tvs = 40\n\n# Calculate number of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs\nsmart_tvs = total_tvs * (1/4)\nanalog_tvs = total_tvs * (1/8)\nprojection_tvs = total_tvs * (1/5)\n\n# Calculate the total number of non-OLED TVs\nnon_oled_tvs = smart_tvs + analog_tvs + projection_tvs\n\n# Calculate the number of OLED TVs\noled_tvs = total_tvs - non_oled_tvs\n\n# Display the result\nprint(oled_tvs)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Let's go through the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Fractions for Each TV Type**:\n   - Smart TVs account for \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the total sales.\n   - Analog TVs account for \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of the total sales.\n   - Projection TVs account for \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the total sales.\n\n2. **Determine the Sales in Terms of the Fraction of the Total**:\n   - The total number of TVs sold is 40. Therefore, the number of smart TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10 \\).\n   - The number of analog TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times 40 = 5 \\).\n   - The number of projection TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 40 = 8 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Number of Non-OLED TVs**:\n   - Add the quantities of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs: \\( 10 + 5 + 8 = 23 \\).\n\n4. **Subtract Non-OLED from Total Sales**:\n   - OLED TVs account for the remainder of the total. Therefore, the number of OLED TVs is \\( 40 - 23 = 17 \\).\n\nHence, Samwell was able to sell 17 OLED TVs.\n\nI will now open the floor for discussion with the other agents to ensure alignment and address any discrepancies."
