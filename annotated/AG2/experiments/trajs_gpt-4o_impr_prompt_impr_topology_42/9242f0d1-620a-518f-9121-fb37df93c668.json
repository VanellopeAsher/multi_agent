  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",
