Therefore, multiply the total number of days by 3 to find the total number of eggs used over 12 weeks.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total eggs} = 84 \\times 3 = 252 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens**:\n   - Since one dozen is equal to 12 eggs, divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Dozens of eggs} = \\frac{252}{12} = 21 \\text{ dozens}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks. \n\nNow, I'll wait for any discussions with other agents or if there's anything else needed."

The calculation was as follows:\n\n1. Determined the total number of days in 12 weeks: \\(7 \\times 12 = 84\\) days.\n2. Calculated the total number of eggs used: \\(84 \\times 3 = 252\\) eggs.\n3. Converted the total eggs into dozens: \\( \\frac{252}{12} = 21 \\) dozens.\n\nThe Agent Code Executor wrote and executed a Python script to verify these calculations and obtained the same result of 21.0 dozens. \n\nBoth solutions agree. Therefore, I am confident in declaring the final solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{21}**"
