Let the Sunday apple pie sales be `A_sunday`. Thus, the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday is `A_s = A_sunday - 4`.\n\n   - **Sunday**:\n     - Gingerbread: He sold 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so `G_sunday = G_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15`.\n     - Apple Pie: `A_sunday = 15` (given directly).\n\n   - **Monday**:\n     - Gingerbread: He sold 2 boxes, `G_m = 2`.\n     - Apple Pie: He sold 4 boxes, `A_m = 4`.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Boxes Sold Over Three Days**:\n   - Total Gingerbread: `G_total = G_s + G_sunday + G_m = 10 + 15 + 2 = 27`.\n   - Total Apple Pie: `A_total = A_s + A_sunday + A_m = (A_sunday - 4) + A_sunday + 4 = 15 - 4 + 15 + 4 = 30`.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Earnings**:\n   - Gingerbread Earnings: Each costs $6.\n     `E_g = G_total * 6 = 27 * 6 = 162`.\n   - Apple Pie Earnings: Each costs $15.\n     `E_a = A_total * 15 = 30 * 15 = 450`.\n\n4. **Total Earnings for Three Days**:\n   - `Total Earnings = E_g + E_a = 162 + 450 = 612`.\n\nSunny earned a total of $612 for the three days. \n\nNow, let's proceed to discuss and verify the solution with the other agents."
