So, we add this amount to his initial savings:\n   \\[\n   2100 + 1100 = 3200\n   \\]\n   This means Raymond now has $3200.\n\n3. **Spending on Comic Book**: Raymond spends $500 on a comic book. We deduct this from his total amount:\n   \\[\n   3200 - 500 = 2700\n   \\]\n\n4. **Spending on Puzzle**: Raymond also spends $1900 on a puzzle. We deduct this amount as well:\n   \\[\n   2700 - 1900 = 800\n   \\]\n\nSo, after all his savings and expenditures, Raymond is left with $800."
