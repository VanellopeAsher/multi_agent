      "content": "To find out how many packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:\n\n1. Let's use the following variables:\n   - \\( t \\): the number of packets of tomato seeds\n   - \\( c \\): the number of packets of celery seeds\n\n2. From the problem, we have the following information:\n   - The cost of a packet of tomato seeds is $40.\n   - The cost of a packet of celery seeds is $30.\n   - Mrs. Rylan spent a total of $3200 on seeds.\n   - She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n\n3. We can represent these conditions by the following equations:\n   - The cost equation: \\( 40t + 30c = 3200 \\)\n   - The number of celery seeds equation: \\( c = 80 \\)\n\n4. Substitute the value of \\( c \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n   \\[\n   40t + 30(80) = 3200\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   40t + 2400 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n6. Solve for \\( t \\) by subtracting 2400 from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   40t = 800\n   \\]\n\n7. Divide both sides by 40 to get the value of \\( t \\):\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{800}{40} = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.\n\nNow to discuss and verify this solution, let's go over this systematically with the team."

Let's verify the calculations to ensure accuracy before Agent Code Executor writes the corresponding Python code.\n\nWe established two linear equations based on the problem's details:\n1. The total spending equation: \\( 40t + 30c = 3200 \\)\n2. The specific number of celery seed packets: \\( c = 80 \\)\n\nBy substituting \\( c = 80 \\) into the first equation, we calculated the total cost contribution from the celery seeds, removing it from the total expenditure to find the total cost for the tomato seeds:\n- \\( 30 \\times 80 = 2400 \\): Spending on celery seeds.\n- Total left for tomato seeds: \\( 3200 - 2400 = 800 \\).\n  \nWe then solved for the number of tomato seed packets, dividing their total cost by the price per packet:\n- \\( t = \\frac{800}{40} = 20 \\).\n\nThe results appear correct.
