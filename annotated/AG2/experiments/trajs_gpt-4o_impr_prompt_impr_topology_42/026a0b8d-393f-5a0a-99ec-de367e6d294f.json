      "content": "To find out how many packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:\n\n1. Let's use the following variables:\n   - \\( t \\): the number of packets of tomato seeds\n   - \\( c \\): the number of packets of celery seeds\n\n2. From the problem, we have the following information:\n   - The cost of a packet of tomato seeds is $40.\n   - The cost of a packet of celery seeds is $30.\n   - Mrs. Rylan spent a total of $3200 on seeds.\n   - She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n\n3. We can represent these conditions by the following equations:\n   - The cost equation: \\( 40t + 30c = 3200 \\)\n   - The number of celery seeds equation: \\( c = 80 \\)\n\n4. Substitute the value of \\( c \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n   \\[\n   40t + 30(80) = 3200\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   40t + 2400 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n6. Solve for \\( t \\) by subtracting 2400 from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   40t = 800\n   \\]\n\n7. Divide both sides by 40 to get the value of \\( t \\):\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{800}{40} = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.\n\nNow to discuss and verify this solution, let's go over this systematically with the team."

The total spending equation: \\( 40t + 30c = 3200 \\)\n2. The specific number of celery seed packets: \\( c = 80 \\)\n\nBy substituting \\( c = 80 \\) into the first equation, we calculated the total cost contribution from the celery seeds, removing it from the total expenditure to find the total cost for the tomato seeds:\n- \\( 30 \\times 80 = 2400 \\): Spending on celery seeds.\n- Total left for tomato seeds: \\( 3200 - 2400 = 800 \\).\n  \nWe then solved for the number of tomato seed packets, dividing their total cost by the price per packet:\n- \\( t = \\frac{800}{40} = 20 \\).\n\nThe results appear correct.
