Both agents correctly computed:\n\n1. The amount of weight Mark lost over the 3 months: \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) pounds.\n2. The amount of weight he regained over the 2 months: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) pounds.\n3. Used the final weight, along with the above calculations, to set up the equation and solve for the initial weight:  \n\n   \\((W - 30) + 10 = 70\\), simplifying to \\(W = 90\\).\n\nThus, the initial weight was calculated correctly to be 90 pounds.\n\nTherefore, I am confident in confirming the final solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{90}**"
