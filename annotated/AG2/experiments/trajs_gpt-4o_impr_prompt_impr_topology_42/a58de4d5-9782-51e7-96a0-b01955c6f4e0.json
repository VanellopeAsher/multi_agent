Here's how we can compute it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of Ingredients for One Jar:**\n   - **Passion Fruit Cost**: \n     - 2 pounds × $6 per pound = $12\n   - **Jackfruit Cost**: \n     - 1.5 pounds × $8 per pound = $12\n   - **Honey Cost**: \n     - 2 pounds × $10 per pound = $20\n   - The secret ingredient (water) is free.\n\n   Adding these up gives us the total cost for one jar:\n   \\[\n   \\$12 + \\$12 + \\$20 = \\$44\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Revenue from Selling One Jar:**\n   - Each jar is sold for $50.\n\n3. **Calculate the Profit per Jar:**\n   - Profit per jar = Selling price per jar - Cost per jar\n   - Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Profit for Selling 10 Jars:**\n   - Profit for 10 jars = Profit per jar × Number of jars\n   - Profit for 10 jars = $6 × 10 = $60\n\nTherefore, Tim makes a total profit of $60 from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam blend."
