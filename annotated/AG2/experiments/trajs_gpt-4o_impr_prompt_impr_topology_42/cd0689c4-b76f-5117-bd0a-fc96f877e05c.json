We have a total of 144 inches of ribbon to distribute equally among the 12 presents.\n\n3. Calculate the ribbon length each present receives:\n   - Total ribbon length = 144 inches\n   - Total presents = 12\n\n   Ribbon length per present = Total ribbon length / Total presents = 144 / 12 = 12 inches\n\nThus, Monica can allocate **12 inches** of ribbon to each present for the bows.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}"
