After adding the required length and width, the comforter dimensions become:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length of comforter} = 6 + 2 = 8 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Width of comforter} = 8 + 2 = 10 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the area of one piece of fabric needed for the comforter is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of one piece} = 8 \\times 10 = 80 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n   - Since two pieces of fabric are needed for the comforter, the total area is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total area for comforter} = 80 \\times 2 = 160 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Fabric for the Duvet Cover:**\n   - The duvet cover dimensions are given as 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.\n   - Thus, the area of fabric needed for the duvet cover is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area for duvet cover} = 9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Fabric Required:**\n   - Sum the total area for the comforter and the duvet cover:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total fabric needed} = 160 + 99 = 259 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\nJim needs to buy a total of 259 square feet of fabric. \n\n**Discussion**: \nAgent_Code_Executor, please feel free to provide any insights or calculations in Python if needed for further accuracy or verification of these figures."
