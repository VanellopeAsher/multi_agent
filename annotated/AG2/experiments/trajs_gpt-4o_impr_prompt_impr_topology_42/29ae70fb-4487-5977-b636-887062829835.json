Therefore, if he attends all classes, the cost per class is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per class} = \\frac{60}{10} = \\$6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand the Condition**:  \n   His parents will not allow him to continue if the cost of each class he attends exceeds $10. We need to find out what is the maximum cost he can incur per class attended.\n\n3. **Set up an Inequality for Cost Per Attended Class**:  \n   Let \\(x\\) represent the number of classes Manny actually attends. Then the cost per attended class is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Inequality**:  \n   \\[\n   60 \\leq 10x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\leq x\n   \\]\n   This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost at or below $10 per class.\n\n5. **Determine Number of Classes Manny Can Miss**:  \n   Since there are 10 classes in total, and he must attend at least 6:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of classes he can miss} = 10 - 6 = 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes while still keeping the cost per attended class at $10 or less."
