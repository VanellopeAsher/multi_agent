Billy has a total of 50 days from March 1st to April 19th (31 days in March and 19 days in April).\n2. He takes off 20% of these days, which comes out to 10 days off (20% of 50).\n3. Therefore, he works for 40 days (50 total days - 10 days off).\n4. He works for 3 hours each day, making it a total of 120 hours (40 working days Ã— 3 hours per day).\n5. He helps a total of 240 people in this duration.\n6. Therefore, the number of people he helps per hour is 2, calculated by dividing 240 people by 120 hours.\n\nHence, both manual calculation and code execution confirm the result that Billy helps 2 people per hour.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2}**"
