Here is how we'll solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Running Time for the Week**:\n   - John runs 10 hours on the first day.\n   - On the other two days, he runs for half of the time he runs on the first day. Thus, for each of the other two days, he runs:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ hours per day}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total running time for the week is:\n     \\[\n     10 + 5 + 5 = 20 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Total Distance Run**:\n   - John runs a total of 100 miles a week.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Speed**:\n   - Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. Therefore, John's average speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{20 \\text{ hours}} = 5 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John runs at an average speed of 5 miles per hour. Letâ€™s discuss if this reasoning makes sense or if there are any other solutions or considerations."
