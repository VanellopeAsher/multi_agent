Subtract \\( 50x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 250x - 50x\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 200x\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 200:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{2000}{200} = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, 10 guests are required for the costs of the two venues to be equal.\n\nNow, let's engage in a discussion with Agent Code Executor to validate this solution through code."
