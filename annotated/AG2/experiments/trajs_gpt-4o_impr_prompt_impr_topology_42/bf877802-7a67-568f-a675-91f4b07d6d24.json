      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total angle in degrees that the sun has moved from its initial position atop the Great Pyramid after a given period. Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is positioned at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.\n\n2. **First Phase of Movement** (10 hours at 5 degrees per hour):\n   - The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours.\n   - Therefore, during this phase, the sun will move:\n     \\[\n     5 \\, \\text{degrees/hour} \\times 10 \\, \\text{hours} = 50 \\, \\text{degrees}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Second Phase of Movement** (2 hours at 3 degrees per hour):\n   - After the initial 10 hours, the sun continues to move, but at a reduced rate of 3 degrees per hour for 2 additional hours.\n   - Therefore, during this phase, the sun will move:\n     \\[\n     3 \\, \\text{degrees/hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 6 \\, \\text{degrees}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Movement**:\n   - Total angle moved during both phases is the sum of movements in both phases: \n     \\[\n     50 \\, \\text{degrees} + 6 \\, \\text{degrees} = 56 \\, \\text{degrees}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Angle from the Ground**:\n   - The initial position of the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground.\n   - Therefore, after moving a total of 56 degrees upwards, the sun's angle from the ground will be:\n     \\[\n     32 \\, \\text{degrees} + 56 \\, \\text{degrees} = 88 \\, \\text{degrees}\n     \\]\n\nThus, after the entire motion, the sun will be at an angle of 88 degrees from the ground."
