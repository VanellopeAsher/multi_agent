Each truck tire is charged at $60.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from truck tires on Thursday} = 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ dollars} \n     \\]\n   - The mechanic repairs 4 car tires. Each car tire is charged at $40.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from car tires on Thursday} = 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Total earnings on Thursday:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total earnings on Thursday} = 360 + 160 = 520 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Earnings for Friday**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n   - Each car tire is charged at $40.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings on Friday} = 40 \\times x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Use the Given Information to Form an Equation**:\n   - We know the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n     \\[\n     520 = 40x + 40\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     520 - 40 = 40x \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     480 = 40x \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{480}{40}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 12\n     \\]\n\nThus, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or any further steps needed!"
