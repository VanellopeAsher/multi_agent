      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break down the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially**:\n   - Let's denote the initial number of boxes of oranges that Mrs. Harrington bought as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Determine oranges given away**:\n   - Mrs. Harrington gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, for a total of 4 boxes given away.\n   - So, the number of boxes left with her after gifting is \\( x - 4 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of oranges in the remaining boxes**:\n   - Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges in the boxes that Mrs. Harrington kept is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times (x - 4)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself**:\n   - It is mentioned that Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.\n   - The number of oranges she kept is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 \\times (x - 4)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of oranges she sold**:\n   - The remaining oranges would be the ones she sold. Since she kept 1/4 for herself, she sold the remaining 3/4.\n   - So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 \\times (x - 4)\n   \\]\n\nWithout knowing the original number of boxes (\\( x \\)), we cannot determine the exact number of oranges sold. However, using this formula, you can easily substitute the initial number of boxes once it is known. \n\nFor instance, if she started with 10 boxes, then the number of oranges sold would be:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 \\times (10 - 4) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 \\times 6 = 90 \\text{ oranges}\n\\]\n\nPlease let me know if you have the actual number of initial boxes so we can find the specific number of oranges sold."

From the remaining oranges, she kept 1/4 and sold the remaining 3/4.\n\nLet's implement the calculation in Python. \n\n```python\ndef oranges_sold(initial_boxes: int) -> int:\n    # Total oranges after giving away 4 boxes: remaining_boxes = initial_boxes - 4\n    remaining_boxes = initial_boxes - 4\n    total_remaining_oranges = remaining_boxes * 20\n    \n    # Oranges kept by Mrs. Harrington: she keeps 1/4 of them\n    oranges_kept = total_remaining_oranges * 1/4\n    \n    # Oranges sold by Mrs. Harrington: she sells 3/4 of them\n    oranges_sold = total_remaining_oranges - oranges_kept  # equivalently, total_remaining_oranges * 3/4\n    \n    return int(oranges_sold)\n\n# For example, if Mrs. Harrington initially had 10 boxes:\ninitial_boxes = 10\n_result_ = oranges_sold(initial_boxes)\nprint(_result_)\n```\n\nI am going to execute the Python code above to find the number of oranges sold with the given initial number of boxes. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
