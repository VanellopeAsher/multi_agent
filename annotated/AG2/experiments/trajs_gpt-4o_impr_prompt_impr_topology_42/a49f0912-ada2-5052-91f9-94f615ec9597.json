      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time John spent on all activities and then determine how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n1. Calculate time spent on each activity: \n   - **Boating**: John spent 60 hours boating.\n   - **Swimming**: He spent half the time swimming that he did boating. So, \\(\\text{Swim Time} = \\frac{60 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 30 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n2. Calculate the time spent watching shows:\n   - John watched 30 shows, each 20 hours long. Therefore, \\(\\text{Watch Time} = 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n3. Calculate the total time these activities represent 30% of:\n   - The total time for all vacation activities is represented by \\( T \\).\n   - Since watching shows (600 hours) accounts for 30% of his vacation time:\n     \\[\n     0.30T = 600\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( T \\), we divide by 0.30:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{600}{0.30} = 2000 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n4. Calculate the sightseeing time (40% of the total time): \n   - \\(\\text{Sightseeing Time} = 0.40 \\times 2000 = 800 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nTherefore, John spent 800 hours sightseeing during his vacation."
