      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to figure out the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap and then decide how much ribbon she can use for each bow. However, to determine the amount of ribbon for each gift bow, we must first establish if there are constraints like a certain length of ribbon available, which is not mentioned in the problem. Assuming there is no constraint on the ribbon and we simply need to find out if there is a division of ribbon per gift, I'll proceed as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Identify the number of gifts:**\n   - Gifts for family: 6\n   - Gifts for friends: 4\n   - Gifts for teachers: 2\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of gifts:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total gifts} = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine ribbon per gift:**\n   - As the problem doesn't specify any constraints regarding the length of ribbon available or the desired length for each bow, let's assume Monica wants to distribute any available ribbon equally among all gifts.\n   - Without more specific data, we can state that Monica needs an equal length of ribbon for each bow. In real-world problems, this would require a given total ribbon length available to provide a definitive answer.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional constraints or totals on the ribbon, the solution concludes without a specific length for the ribbon per gift. Each gift will simply receive a uniform portion of the available ribbon, which needs to be specified to continue with actual numbers.\n\nAs currently structured, we need additional data to provide a quantitative solution (e.g., \"Monica has X inches of ribbon available\"). However, with available information, it is recognized that she will distribute her ribbon equally across the 12 gift bows."
