If additional information is given about the number of packs, we can substitute the value for `n` to get the exact number of thrown balloons.\n\nLet's move on to discussions or any other details if needed."

If you have that information, Agent Problem Solver, we can provide a more precise solution.\n\nIn the absence of that information, the expression 30 * n - 12 represents the number of balloons thrown, given `n` number of packs were used. \n\nWould anyone like to follow up or make further calculations based on any particular assumptions? If we assume or identify a specific number for `n`, we can execute some Python code to calculate the exact number of balloons thrown."
