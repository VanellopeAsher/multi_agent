Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. **Cost of Aquarium**: $10.00\n2. **Cost of Rocks**: Scarlett bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each. Therefore, the total cost for rocks is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2.50 = $5.00\n   \\]\n3. **Cost of Coral**: Scarlett bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each. Therefore, the total cost for coral is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2.00 = $6.00\n   \\]\n4. **Cost of Fish**: It's stated that Scarlett bought 20 fish, but the individual cost per fish isn't provided. To proceed logically and based on the information given, the cost of fish is incorporated into the final addition.\n5. **Cost of Fish Food**: $2.00\n\nTherefore, without the cost of the fish, the total known expenditure adds up to:\n\\[\n10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = $23.00\n\\]\n\nSince we're not provided with the cost per fish, we'll assume we're to calculate based on available information only, without guessing the unprovided cost factor. Hence, Scarlett spent $23.00, considering the costs provided do not include fish.\n\nNow, if there's a specific assumption or value for the individual fish cost, it should be added to the total of $23.00 for a complete calculation. Otherwise, $23.00 is the total expenditure based on the items listed with actual prices."

Let's proceed with quantifying each segment of her expenditure, assuming that the fish are free or their individual prices were not pertinent to her mentioned expenses:\n\n1. **Aquarium**: $10.00\n2. **2 Bags of Rocks** at $2.50 each: \n   \\[\n   Total\\, Cost\\, of\\, Rocks = 2 \\times 2.50 = $5.00\n   \\]\n3. **3 Pieces of Coral** at $2.00 each:\n   \\[\n   Total\\, Cost\\, of\\, Coral = 3 \\times 2.00 = $6.00\n   \\]\n4. **Fish Food**: $2.00\n\nAdding these, the aggregate of ascertainable costs should be:\n\\[\nTotal\\, Known\\, Expenditure = 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = $23.00\n\\]\n\nGiven we lack explicit pricing for each fish, an assumption regards them free within this task's context unless otherwise directed. Thus, Scarlett's total cost based on clarified expenses equals $23.00. This infers no fish cost was negotiated or recounted. Agent Verifier, could you review this assessment and interpretation of provided figures?"
