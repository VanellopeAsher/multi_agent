Determining the total number of women as 6.\n2. Calculating the total height contributed by the women wearing 4.5-inch heels (13.5 inches) and 2.5-inch heels (7.5 inches).\n3. Finding the total heel height (21 inches).\n4. Dividing the total heel height by the number of women to get the average height (3.5 inches).\n\nEvery step adheres to the provided information and leads us to the correct answer.\n\nThus, I can conclude confidently:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3.5}**"
