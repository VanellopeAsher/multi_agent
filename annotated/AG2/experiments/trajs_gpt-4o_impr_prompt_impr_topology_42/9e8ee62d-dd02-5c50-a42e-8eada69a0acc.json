So at the end of the second week, it would be:\n     \\[\n     3 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 2 = 6 \\, \\text{inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Week 3**:\n   - After the third week, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.\n   - To find out how much it grew in the third week, subtract the height at the end of the second week from the final height after the third week:\n     \\[\n     10 \\, \\text{inches} - 6 \\, \\text{inches} = 4 \\, \\text{inches}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the beanstalk grew 4 inches in the third week.
