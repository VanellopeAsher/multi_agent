If Jordan works every day instead of playing video games, his weekly earnings would be `7 * 10 * h`, or simplified, `70 * h` dollars in one week.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - The weekly income, depending on the hours of video game time replaced by work, is `70 * h` dollars.\n\nAssuming you provide a particular value for `h`, we could calculate the specific amount Jordan would earn. Otherwise, this is the general formula to determine his weekly earnings based on his replaced video game hours."

Now, I'll write the Python code to calculate his weekly earnings.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of hours Jordan plays video games each day\nh = 3\n\n# Calculate his daily earnings if he worked instead of playing video games\ndaily_earnings = 10 * h\n\n# Calculate his weekly earnings based on working every day\nweekly_earnings = 7 * daily_earnings\n\nprint(weekly_earnings)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to see the result. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Therefore, calculations based on assumed values are not valid without explicit problem data.\n\nTo adhere to the principle of \"Avoid Assumptions,\" the final solution should only incorporate given data.
