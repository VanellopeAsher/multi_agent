If Jordan works every day instead of playing video games, his weekly earnings would be `7 * 10 * h`, or simplified, `70 * h` dollars in one week.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - The weekly income, depending on the hours of video game time replaced by work, is `70 * h` dollars.\n\nAssuming you provide a particular value for `h`, we could calculate the specific amount Jordan would earn. Otherwise, this is the general formula to determine his weekly earnings based on his replaced video game hours."
