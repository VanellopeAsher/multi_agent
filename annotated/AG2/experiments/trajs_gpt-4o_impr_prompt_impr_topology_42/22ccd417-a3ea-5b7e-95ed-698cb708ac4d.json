There are two types of medicine involved:\n   - \\( x \\, \\text{mL} \\) of the first medicine\n   - \\( 3x \\, \\text{mL} \\) of the second medicine (since it's 3 times that of the first medicine)\n\n2. Together, these make up a single dose, so each dose is comprised of:\n   \\[\n   x + 3x = 4x \\, \\text{mL}\n   \\]\n\n3. In total, there are 8 doses, and altogether, they account for 448 mL of mixed medicine.\n\nWe need to find the amount of the first medicine in each dose, denoted as \\( x \\).\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Total for One Dose:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 4x = 448\n   \\] \n   (since there are 8 doses and each dose totals 4x mL)\n\n2. **Solve for x:**\n   \\[\n   32x = 448\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{448}{32}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 14\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of the first medicine \\( x \\) used in each dose is 14 mL.\n\nTherefore, \\( 14 \\) mL of one medicine is combined by Saanvi each time. Now, let's discuss if there are any concerns or alternative thoughts on this approach, or if any aspect needs clarification with other agents."
