      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of female unicorns in Scotland**: \n   We're told that there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland.\n\n2. **Understand the fraction of Scottish unicorns that are female**:\n   It's given that two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. This means that the 6 female unicorns make up two-thirds of all the unicorns in Scotland.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of Scottish unicorns**:\n   If 6 unicorns represent two-thirds, we can find the total by setting up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Scottish Unicorns} = \\frac{6}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 6 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands**:\n   We're told that one-third of all the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Therefore, if \\( x \\) is the total number of unicorns in the world, one-third of \\( x \\) should equal 9.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{3} = 9 \\implies x = 27\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of unicorns left in the world**:\n   Since the total number of unicorns is 27 and 9 of them are in the Scottish Highlands, the number of unicorns left in the rest of the world is:\n   \\[\n   27 - 9 = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 18 unicorns left in the world outside of the Scottish Highlands."
