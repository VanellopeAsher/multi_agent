      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of phone calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, taking into account the additional hours on Friday.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Normal Work Hours**: Tim works 6 hours each day from Monday to Thursday. Since there are no extra hours on these days, we'll calculate the total calls he handles during these days first.\n   \n   - Number of hours worked from Monday to Thursday = 6 hours/day * 4 days = 24 hours\n\n2. **Additional Friday Hours**: On Friday, Tim works an additional 2 hours, making it a total of 8 hours.\n\n   - Total hours worked on Friday = 8 hours\n\n3. **Total Work Hours in a Week**: Add the hours worked from Monday to Thursday and Friday.\n\n   - Weekly total hours = 24 hours (Mon-Thu) + 8 hours (Fri) = 32 hours\n\n4. **Time per Call**: It takes him 15 minutes to handle one call. We'll convert hours into minutes because it's more convenient for our next calculation.\n\n   - 1 hour = 60 minutes\n\n5. **Total Possible Calls in a Week**: Calculate the total number of calls Tim can handle in 32 hours.\n\n   - Total work minutes in the week = 32 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1920 minutes\n   - Since each call takes 15 minutes: \n   \n     Total number of calls = 1920 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 128 calls\n\nSo, Tim deals with **128 calls** during his 5-day work week, considering the additional hours on Friday.\n\nOnce you've noted this solution, feel free to discuss and validate it with the others."
