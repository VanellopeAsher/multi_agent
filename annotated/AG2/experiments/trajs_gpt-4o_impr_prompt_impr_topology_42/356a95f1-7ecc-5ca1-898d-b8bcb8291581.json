      "content": "To solve this problem, we can set up a simple equation. Let's denote the length of fence that Sam gets as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam. Therefore, the length of fence that Harry gets can be denoted as \\( S + 80 \\).\n\nThe total length of the fence is 200 feet. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ S + (S + 80) = 200 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n\\[ 2S + 80 = 200 \\]\n\nSubtracting 80 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 2S = 120 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\n\\[ S = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sam gets 60 feet of the fence. Let's verify the problem statement:\n\n- Harry gets \\( 60 + 80 = 140 \\) feet of fence.\n- Adding up Sam and Harry's portions: \\( 60 + 140 = 200 \\), which matches the total fence available.\n\nThus, Sam gets 60 feet, which is the amount left over for him."
