Therefore, his daily budget is $70/7 = $10 per day.\n\n2. **Days and Costs**:\n   - From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures costing $5 each.\n   - From Thursday through Saturday, Peter purchases plastic action figures costing $2.5 each.\n\n3. **Calculate Action Figures for Each Day Type**:\n   - **Sunday through Wednesday (4 days)**:\n     - Daily budget on action figures: $10.\n     - Number of wooden action figures per day: $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures.\n     - Total wooden action figures for 4 days: 2 action figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures.\n\n   - **Thursday through Saturday (3 days)**:\n     - Daily budget on action figures: $10.\n     - Number of plastic action figures per day: $10 / $2.5 = 4 plastic action figures.\n     - Total plastic action figures for 3 days: 4 action figures/day * 3 days = 12 plastic action figures.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Action Figures**:\n   - Total action figures = Total wooden action figures + Total plastic action figures.\n   - Total action figures = 8 wooden action figures + 12 plastic action figures = 20 action figures.\n\nTherefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 20 action figures.\n\nLet's discuss and confirm the calculations with the team."
