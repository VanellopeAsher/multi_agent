Their processes involved determining the price of the T-shirts with the buy-one-get-one-50%-off deal and the discounted price of the shoes. \n\nThe calculations followed:\n- For T-shirts: Paired the 20 T-shirts into 10 pairs, each pair costing $120 (with one at full price $80 and one at half price $40), totaling $1,200.\n- For shoes: With a 40% discount, the shoes originally priced at $400 cost $240.\n- Therefore, the total amount spent is $1,200 + $240 = $1,440.\n\nThus, I conclude that both solutions are valid and agree, and therefore the final amount Jake spends at the store is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{1440}**"
