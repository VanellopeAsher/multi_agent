Thus, she writes:\n   \\[\n   78 + 13 = 91 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rewriting Everything She Already Wrote**:  \n   At this point, she has written a total of 91 letters. She rewrites what she has written, contributing an additional:\n   \\[\n   91 \\times 2 = 182 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 182.\n\nLet's discuss this approach with the other agents to confirm it's comprehensive and correct."
