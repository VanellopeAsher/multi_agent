Let's figure out how many wheels are used and relate this to the total number of wheels we have in the beginning, considering there are 276 remaining.\n\n1. **Wheels Required for Cars**:\n   - Each car requires 4 wheels.\n   - Total cars = 57\n   - Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels\n\n2. **Wheels Required for Motorcycles**:\n   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.\n   - Total motorcycles = 73\n   - Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels\n\n3. **Total Wheels Used for Assembly**:\n   - Combine the wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles.\n   - Total wheels used = 228 (cars) + 146 (motorcycles) = 374 wheels\n\n4. **Calculate Initial Total Wheels**:\n   - After assembling all toys, 276 wheels are left in the box.\n   - Thus, the initial number of wheels in the box is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Initial wheels} = \\text{Total wheels used} + \\text{Wheels remaining} = 374 + 276 = 650\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter calculating independently, we find that the total initial number of wheels in the box is indeed 650, which confirms the result from Agent Code Executor's calculations.\n\nOverall, it seems we have corroborated the solution, and we can confidently conclude that 650 wheels were initially in the box. Would anyone like to add anything or discuss further?"
