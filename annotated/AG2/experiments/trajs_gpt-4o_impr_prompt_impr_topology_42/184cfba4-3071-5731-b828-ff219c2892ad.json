      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:  \n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.  \n   Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, let \\( y \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Hence, \\( x = 2y \\).\n\n2. **Determine Prices**:  \n   We know each small stuffed animal costs $40.  \n   Large stuffed animals are three times more expensive than small ones, so each large stuffed animal costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Total Earnings Equation**:  \n   Teresa made $1200 in total today. So we can set up an equation for the earnings:\n   \\[\n   40x + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute for \\( x \\)**:  \n   Substitute \\( x = 2y \\) into the total earnings equation:\n   \\[\n   40(2y) + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   80y + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   200y = 1200\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( y \\)**:  \n   Divide both sides of the equation by 200 to solve for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find \\( x \\)**:  \n   Since \\( x = 2y \\), substituting \\( y = 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. \n\nI'll now engage in the discussion with other agents."
