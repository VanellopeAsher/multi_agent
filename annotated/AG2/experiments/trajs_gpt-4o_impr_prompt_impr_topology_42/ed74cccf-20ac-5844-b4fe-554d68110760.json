      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll break down and calculate the total number of students engaged in each activity, and then sum them up to find the total number of students.\n\n1. **Identify the Groups Involved:**\n   - Tennis Players: 6 students\n   - Volleyball Players: Twice the number of tennis players, which is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) students\n   - Soccer Players: The total number of soccer players is the sum of boys and 22 girls. Since we don't have the number of boys, we'll denote the number of boys as \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Establish the Equation for Total Students:**\n   - Total students can be represented by adding all individual groups together. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = \\text{Tennis Players} + \\text{Volleyball Players} + \\text{Soccer Players}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 6 + 12 + (b + 22)\n     \\] \n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 18 + (b + 22) = b + 40\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without the specific number of boys (denoted by \\( b \\)) playing soccer, we cannot find the exact total number of students. However, the relation given is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = b + 40\n     \\]\n\n   So, the total number of students depends on the number of boys involved in soccer. Further information about the number of boys is required to provide a numerical answer."
