However, we can describe the formula for calculating the percentage if the shark's length is provided.\n\n3. **Example Calculation (if shark's length was given, say L inches)**:\n   - Percentage of shark's body length the remoras account for = \\( \\left( \\frac{12}{L} \\right) \\times 100 \\).\n\nDiscussion:\n- To proceed, we would need either an assumption or additional information about the shark's length.\n- Once we know \\( L \\), it would be straightforward to compute the exact percentage using step 3.\n\nPlease provide the shark's length to complete the calculation, or let us know if there are any assumptions to be made about its size."
