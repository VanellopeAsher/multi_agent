      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break it down into steps and use an algebraic approach:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: \n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since there are two twins, and each found 30 eggs, \\( S = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\).\n   - Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of eggs.\n   - Let \\( F \\) represent the number of eggs found by the friends.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   - We know from the problem statement that all except 10 eggs were found by their friends, which implies the number of eggs the friends found can be represented as \\( F = T - 60 - 10 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for Friends' Eggs**:\n   - Simplify the equation to find how many eggs the friends found: \n     \\[\n     F = T - 70\n     \\]\n\nHowever, the sum of eggs doesn't necessarily need to be defined explicitly; based on the information given where the twins found a fixed number and the rest were found except 10, then directly:\n- Total eggs found by the friends = Total eggs - Eggs found by the twins - Unfound eggs\n  Given that:  \n  \\[\n  F = T - S - 10 = T - 60 - 10 = T - 70\n  \\]\n\nThe solution to how many eggs the friends found is simply implicit by understanding that the remainder after subtracting the twins' count (60) and the unfound (10) means friends found the remainder of total count minus 70. If more details are needed or specific total counted, we assume as \\( T - 70 \\) initially, based on details later regarded to total eggs (if specified).\n  \nContinuing to discuss or verify would allow for ensuring assumptions align with count if then normalized based on a complete total count. Interactions could further specify assumed total count, ensuring clarity of outlines by depiction of given operations (like debugging a calculation). Engage if further specification needed."
