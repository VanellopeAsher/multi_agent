Therefore, the equation is:\n     \\[\n     Pp + Pl + J = 100\n     \\]\n\n3. **Establish Relationships Between Ages**:\n   - Paul is 18 years older than Jean, so:\n     \\[\n     Pl = J + 18\n     \\]\n   - Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, thus:\n     \\[\n     Pp = Pl + J\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equations**:\n   - Substitute the equation \\( Pl = J + 18 \\) and \\( Pp = Pl + J \\) into the first equation:\n     \\[\n     (Pl + J) + Pl + J = 100\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     2Pl + 2J = 100\n     \\]\n   - Further simplification:\n     \\[\n     Pl + J = 50\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( Pl = J + 18 \\) in the equation above:\n     \\[\n     (J + 18) + J = 50\n     \\]\n   - Simplify to find \\( J \\):\n     \\[\n     2J + 18 = 50\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2J = 32\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     J = 16\n     \\]\n   - Now find \\( Pl \\):\n     \\[\n     Pl = J + 18 = 16 + 18 = 34\n     \\]\n   - Finally, find \\( Pp \\):\n     \\[\n     Pp = Pl + J = 34 + 16 = 50\n     \\]\n\nThus, Peter's age is \\( 50 \\) years old. \n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance or if there are portions of this solution that need clarification."
