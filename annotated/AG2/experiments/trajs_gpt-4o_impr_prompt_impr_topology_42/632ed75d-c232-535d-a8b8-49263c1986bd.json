      "content": "Let's determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France, step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: \n   - The first aircraft divides its flights in the following ratio: three-fourths to Greece, and the remaining one-fourth between France and Germany.\n   - The second aircraft flies exclusively to Poland, making a total of 44 flights. This represents half of the first aircraft's total flights.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Daily Flights of the First Aircraft (A1)**:\n   - Since the second aircraft's flights (44 flights) are half the total flights made by the first aircraft, we can denote the total flights of the first aircraft as 44 * 2 = 88 flights.\n\n3. **Determine Flights to Greece**:\n   - Three-fourths of the first aircraft's flights go to Greece. Thus, flights to Greece = \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\\) flights.\n\n4. **Calculate Remaining Flights (France and Germany)**:\n   - The remaining one-fourth of the flights are divided equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the remaining flights = \\(88 - 66 = 22\\) flights.\n   - These 22 flights are to France and Germany, so flights to France = flights to Germany = \\(\\frac{22}{2} = 11\\) flights.\n\nHence, the first aircraft makes 11 daily flights to France. \n\n**Solution**: The number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is 11."

      "content": "Unfortunately, since this problem is a straightforward algebraic calculation and doesn't require complex computation or simulations, there isn't a specific code I can write to add value beyond the solution provided. However, I can verify the calculations done by the Agent Problem Solver here.\n\n1. The second aircraft flies 44 flights to Poland, representing half of the first aircraft's total flights. Therefore, the total number of flights for the first aircraft is \\(2 \\times 44 = 88\\).\n\n2. Three-fourths of these 88 flights are to Greece, so \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\\) flights to Greece.\n\n3. Therefore, the remaining flights are \\(88 - 66 = 22\\).\n\n4. The problem states that the remaining flights are equally divided between France and Germany, so the first aircraft makes \\( \\frac{22}{2} = 11\\) flights each to France and Germany.\n\nThe solution provided by Agent Problem Solver matches these calculations. Thus, I confirm the solution provided is correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{11}**"
