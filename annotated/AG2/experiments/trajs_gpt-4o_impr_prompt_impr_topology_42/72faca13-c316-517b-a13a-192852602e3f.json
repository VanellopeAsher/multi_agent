Therefore, 5 quarters will be worth:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 25 = 125 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n   - She also has 2 dimes. A dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be worth:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n   - The total amount of money Kelly has is the sum of the quarters and dimes:\n     \\[\n     125 + 20 = 145 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost of Purchases:**\n   - Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents.\n   - She also buys a candy bar for 45 cents.\n   - The total cost of these purchases is:\n     \\[\n     55 + 45 = 100 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Money Left After Purchases:**\n   - Subtract the total cost of the purchases from the total amount of money Kelly has:\n     \\[\n     145 - 100 = 45 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\nHence, after buying a can of pop and a candy bar, Kelly will have 45 cents left."
