Therefore, the volume of water on the second day is:\n   \\[\n   4000 \\text{ gallons} \\times 2 = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Day Additional Water**: On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is introduced to the flow. So, the total volume on the third day is:\n   \\[\n   8000 \\text{ gallons} + 6000 \\text{ gallons} = 14000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total volume of water flowing through the river at that point on the third day is 14,000 gallons. \n\nPlease review and let me know if there are further discussions needed."
