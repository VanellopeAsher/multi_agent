We can break this down into days:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 19 days\n   - Total: 200 days\n\n4. **Calculate Daily Calorie Deficit**:\n   Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{105,000 \\text{ calories}}{200 \\text{ days}} = 525 \\text{ calories/day}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th."

The time period from December 31st to July 19th is 200 days.\n5. Dividing the total calories by the number of days gives a daily calorie deficit of \\(\\frac{105,000}{200} = 525\\) calories.\n\nBoth solutions are consistent. Thus, the final verified daily calorie deficit Andy needs is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{525}**"
