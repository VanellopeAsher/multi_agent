So he can plant 6 rows of yellow tulips if needed.\n\n4. **Determine total rows with yellow tulips consideration**:\n       \n       - 6 Red rows contribute 6 yellow rows after each.\n       - Between these, add 6 yellow rows.\n   \\[\n    \\text{Total number of rows of flowers} = 6 (\\text{red}) + 3 (\\text{blue}) + 5 (\\text{yellow}) = 14 \\text{ rows}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jackson will plant a total of 14 rows of flowers in his garden."

However, considering the earlier logic of adding yellows among distinct transitions, the detail was given as after every red row leading to blue the logic was given as 5 but this doesn't include exact transitions. \n\n   Upon further verification with logical placement, this method doesn't align directly with alternating needed detail due to row number mismatches in transitions if based on initial conditions offered directly.\n4. **Total Rows**: Sum of all rows (\\(6 + 3 + 5 = 14\\)) initially calculated seems to miss placing contexts from 6 red directly before considering alternating logic.\n\n### Agent Code Executor Solution:\n- Computes rows of flowers including possible added rows of yellow.\n- Calculates final rows involving boundary check corrections more robustly, manages conditions among red, blue rows attributed around total rows at \\(15\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Agent Code Executor's solution accurately considers each row's placement for yellow tulips and performs checks to ensure no overestimation of yellow rows assuming disjoint transitions without verifying them effectively through the initial. Given these considerations, including logical checks from revised ordering strategies and assumptions verified functionally with alternate context detailed refinements:\n\nBoth logically validated but considering simplicity more directly from execution rule use leads to refined resourced logic more aligned on checks:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{15}**"
