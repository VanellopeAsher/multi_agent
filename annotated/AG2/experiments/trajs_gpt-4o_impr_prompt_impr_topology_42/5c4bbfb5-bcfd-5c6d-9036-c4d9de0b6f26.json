      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Kelly is purchasing and then determine how much money she has remaining if her budget is $65. \n\nWe'll break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Cost of a Single Pack of Bacon**:\n   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10.5 in total. Therefore, the cost of one pack of bacon is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of packs.\n   - Cost of a single pack of bacon = $10.5 / 5 = $2.1.\n\n2. **Cost of Chicken**:\n   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost of a single packet of chicken is:\n   - Cost of one packet of chicken = 2 * $2.1 = $4.2.\n   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken. Therefore, the total cost for the chicken is:\n   - Total cost of chicken = $4.2 * 6 = $25.2.\n\n3. **Cost of Strawberries**:\n   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.5.\n   - Total cost of strawberries = $4.5 * 3 = $13.5.\n\n4. **Cost of Apples**:\n   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Thus, the cost of one pack of apples is:\n   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4.5 / 2 = $2.25.\n   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples. Therefore, the total cost for the apples is:\n   - Total cost of apples = $2.25 * 7 = $15.75.\n\n5. **Total Cost of All Items**:\n   - We now sum the total costs of bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples to find out how much Kelly is spending in total.\n   - Total cost = $10.5 (bacon) + $25.2 (chicken) + $13.5 (strawberries) + $15.75 (apples) = $64.95.\n\n6. **Remaining Budget**:\n   - Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the remaining budget after purchasing the groceries is calculated by subtracting the total cost from her budget.\n   - Remaining budget = $65 - $64.95 = $0.05.\n\nThus, Kelly has $0.05 left in her budget."
