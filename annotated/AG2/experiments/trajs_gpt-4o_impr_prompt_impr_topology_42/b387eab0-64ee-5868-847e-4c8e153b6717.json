      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of calculations to determine the final price per gallon of gas after applying both the cashback and the 10% discount coupon. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Initial Cost of the Gas**:\n   - Price per gallon = $3.00\n   - Number of gallons = 10\n   - Total initial cost = 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00\n\n2. **Calculate the Cashback Amount**:\n   - Cashback per gallon = $0.20\n   - Total cashback = 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost After Cashback**:\n   - Cost after cashback = Total initial cost - Total cashback\n   - Cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00\n\n4. **Apply the 10% Discount Using the Coupon**:\n   - Discount rate = 10% = 0.10\n   - Total discount = 0.10 * $28.00 = $2.80\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Cost After Applying the Discount**:\n   - Final cost = Cost after cashback - Total discount\n   - Final cost = $28.00 - $2.80 = $25.20\n\nThus, the final amount paid after applying both the cashback and the 10% discount with the coupon is **$25.20**. \n\nLet's discuss if there are any concerns or alternative solutions."
