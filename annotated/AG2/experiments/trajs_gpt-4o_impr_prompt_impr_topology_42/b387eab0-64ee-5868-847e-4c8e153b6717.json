      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of calculations to determine the final price per gallon of gas after applying both the cashback and the 10% discount coupon. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Initial Cost of the Gas**:\n   - Price per gallon = $3.00\n   - Number of gallons = 10\n   - Total initial cost = 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00\n\n2. **Calculate the Cashback Amount**:\n   - Cashback per gallon = $0.20\n   - Total cashback = 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost After Cashback**:\n   - Cost after cashback = Total initial cost - Total cashback\n   - Cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00\n\n4. **Apply the 10% Discount Using the Coupon**:\n   - Discount rate = 10% = 0.10\n   - Total discount = 0.10 * $28.00 = $2.80\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Cost After Applying the Discount**:\n   - Final cost = Cost after cashback - Total discount\n   - Final cost = $28.00 - $2.80 = $25.20\n\nThus, the final amount paid after applying both the cashback and the 10% discount with the coupon is **$25.20**. \n\nLet's discuss if there are any concerns or alternative solutions."

Let's ensure the solution is accurate based on their calculations:\n\n1. **Initial Cost of Gas**:\n   - As per the problem, 10 gallons at $3.00 per gallon results in an initial total cost of \\(10 \\times 3.00 = 30.00\\).\n\n2. **Cashback Calculation**:\n   - At $0.20 cashback per gallon for 10 gallons, we have a total cashback of \\(10 \\times 0.20 = 2.00\\).\n\n3. **Cost After Applying Cashback**:\n   - Subtracting the total cashback from the initial cost gives us \\(30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00\\) as the cost after cashback.\n\n4. **Applying the 10% Discount**:\n   - A 10% discount on the $28.00 is \\(0.10 \\times 28.00 = 2.80\\).\n\n5. **Final Cost**:\n   - Subtracting the discount from the cost after cashback, the final cost is \\(28.00 - 2.80 = 25.20\\).\n\nBoth agents concluded that the total amount payable after applying the cashback and discount is $25.20.
