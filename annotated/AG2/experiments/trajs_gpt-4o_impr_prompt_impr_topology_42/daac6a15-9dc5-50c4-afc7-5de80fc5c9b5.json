      "content": "To determine how much money Derrick makes in June by selling doughnuts, we need to understand two things: how many days are in June, and how many doughnuts he sells each day.\n\nWe know the following:\n\n1. June has 30 days.\n2. Each doughnut is sold for $2.\n\nTherefore, to solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Daily Doughnut Sales**: Find out how many doughnuts Derrick sells per day. Letâ€™s assume Derrick sells 100 doughnuts per day if not specified.\n\n2. **Daily Revenue Calculation**: Calculate the daily revenue by multiplying the number of doughnuts sold per day by the price of one doughnut. If 100 doughnuts are sold daily, that would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily Revenue} = 100 \\text{ doughnuts} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/doughnut} = 200 \\text{ dollars/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Monthly Revenue Calculation**: Multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Revenue} = 200 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 6000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, if Derrick sells 100 doughnuts daily in June, he makes a total revenue of 6000 dollars for the month by selling all the doughnuts. If the daily sales figure is different, replace the 100 in the calculation with the correct number."
