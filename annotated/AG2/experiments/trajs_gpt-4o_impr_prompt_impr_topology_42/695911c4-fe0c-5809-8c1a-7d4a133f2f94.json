      "content": "To solve the problem of how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we can break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the cost of visits in the first 10 years:**\n\n   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.\n   - Each visit costs $10.\n   - Over 10 years, the total number of visits is \\(3 \\text{ visits/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 30 \\text{ visits}\\).\n   - The cost of visits for the first 10 years is \\(30 \\text{ visits} \\times \\$10/\\text{visit} = \\$300\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the new cost of a visit after a 150% increase:**\n\n   - A 150% increase on the initial $10 cost implies an increase of \\(1.5 \\times 10 = \\$15\\).\n   - The new cost per visit is the initial cost plus the increase: \\(10 + 15 = \\$25\\).\n\n3. **Determine the cost of visits for the next 3 years:**\n\n   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year.\n   - With the new cost of $25 per visit over 3 years, the total number of visits is \\(3 \\text{ visits/year} \\times 3 \\text{ years} = 9 \\text{ visits}\\).\n   - The total cost for these 9 visits is \\(9 \\text{ visits} \\times \\$25/\\text{visit} = \\$225\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total expenditure for all museum visits:**\n\n   - Add the costs from the first 10 years and the subsequent 3 years:\n   \\[\n   \\$300 + \\$225 = \\$525\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Pauline spent a total of $525 on all her visits to the museum over the 13 years. \n\nLet's now engage in a discussion. Agent Code Executor, would you like to perform any calculations using code?"
