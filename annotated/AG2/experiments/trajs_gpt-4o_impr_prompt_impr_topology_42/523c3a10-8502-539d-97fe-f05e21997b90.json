      "content": "To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate Total S'mores Required**: \n   - There are 9 children, each requiring 2 s'mores. Therefore, the total number of s'mores required by children is:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ children} \\times 2 \\text{ s'mores/child} = 18 \\text{ s'mores}\n     \\]\n   - There are 6 adults, each requiring 1 s'more. Therefore, the total number of s'mores required by adults is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ adults} \\times 1 \\text{ s'more/adult} = 6 \\text{ s'mores}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum Up S'mores Requirements**:\n   - Total number of s'mores needed for both children and adults:\n     \\[\n     18 \\text{ s'mores} + 6 \\text{ s'mores} = 24 \\text{ s'mores}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Number of Packets Needed**:\n   - Each packet of graham crackers can make 8 s'mores. Therefore, the number of packets needed is:\n     \\[\n     \\lceil \\frac{24 \\text{ s'mores}}{8 \\text{ s'mores/packet}} \\rceil = 3 \\text{ packets}\n     \\]\n   - Note: We use the ceiling function because even if we need just a fraction of a packet more, we must round up to account for the full packets required.\n\n4. **Calculate Number of Boxes Needed**:\n   - Each box contains 3 packets. Therefore, the number of boxes needed is:\n     \\[\n     \\lceil \\frac{3 \\text{ packets}}{3 \\text{ packets/box}} \\rceil = 1 \\text{ box}\n     \\]\n\nHence, you would need 1 box of graham crackers to meet the desired number of s'mores."
