Therefore, he runs \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours on each of these days.\n\n3. **Total Time Spent Running Per Week**:\n   - Total time on the first day = 3 hours.\n   - Total time on the other two days = 1.5 hours/day Ã— 2 days = 3 hours.\n   - Total running time for the week = 3 hours (first day) + 3 hours (second and third days) = 6 hours.\n\n4. **Weekly Running Speed**:\n   - Total distance run in a week = 60 miles.\n   - Total time spent running = 6 hours.\n   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\n\n**Conclusion**: John's running speed is 10 miles per hour.\n\nNow let's ensure there are no oversights by discussing this approach."
