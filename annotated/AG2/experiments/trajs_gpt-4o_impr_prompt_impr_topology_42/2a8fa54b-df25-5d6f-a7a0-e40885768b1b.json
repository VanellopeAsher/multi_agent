The mean (average) is calculated as the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Mean = 70\n- Quiz scores (including the forgotten score): 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and an unknown score, \\(x\\).\n\nSince there are 9 total scores (including the unknown score), let's set up the equation based on the mean formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of all scores}}{\\text{Number of scores}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n70 = \\frac{50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + x}{9}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the known scores:\n\n\\[\n50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[\n70 = \\frac{570 + x}{9}\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(x\\), the unknown score:\n\n1. Multiply both sides of the equation by 9 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n   \\[\n   70 \\times 9 = 570 + x\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   630 = 570 + x\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract 570 from both sides to isolate \\(x\\):\n\n   \\[\n   630 - 570 = x\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x = 60\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the forgotten score is 60.\n\nNow to discuss and verify this solution, let's go over this systematically with the team."
