      "content": "To determine how many balloons were thrown, we need to start by calculating the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. Afterward, we'll subtract the number of remaining balloons to find out how many were thrown.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Balloons Initially:**\n\n   Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack contains 100 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons initially is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Balloons} = \\text{Number of Packs} \\times \\text{Balloons per Pack} = 10 \\times 100 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Balloons Thrown:**\n\n   By the end of the afternoon, there are 120 balloons left. If we assume they started with 1000 balloons, the number of balloons thrown would be the initial total minus the remaining balloons:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Thrown} = \\text{Total Balloons} - \\text{Balloons Left} = 1000 - 120 = 880\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jolene and her friends threw **880 balloons**. I look forward to discussing this with the team to verify and ensure there are no oversights."
