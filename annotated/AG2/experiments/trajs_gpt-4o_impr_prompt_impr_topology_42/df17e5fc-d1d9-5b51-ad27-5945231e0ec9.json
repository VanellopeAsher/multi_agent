The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.\n2. Half of this is yellow paint, so 6 pints are used for yellow.\n3. The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among red, white, and purple, which are the other three colors.\n4. Since these remaining 6 pints are equally divided, each color (red, white, and purple) gets \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints.\n\nBoth the reasoning and the code confirm that the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2}**"
