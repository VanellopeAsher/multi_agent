      "content": "To determine how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to evaluate the number of lines he has in each part:\n\n1. **Solo Song:**\n   - The song has 54 lines in total. Since it is a solo, all these lines are Sean's to memorize.\n\n2. **First Scene:**\n   - The total number of lines in the first scene is twice the number of lines in the solo song. Thus, total lines = 2 * 54 = 108 lines.\n   - Sean only has to memorize a third of these lines: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36 \\) lines.\n\n3. **Second Scene:**\n   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song: 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\n   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so he would normally memorize: \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\) lines.\n   - However, itâ€™s pointed out that due to another actor's absence, Sean is specifically required to memorize 15 lines in this scene, which overrides the calculated four-fifths.\n\nAdding up the number of lines Sean is responsible for in each part:\n\n- Song: 54 lines\n- First Scene: 36 lines\n- Second Scene: 15 lines \n\nThus, Sean has to memorize a total of \\( 54 + 36 + 15 = 105 \\) lines."
