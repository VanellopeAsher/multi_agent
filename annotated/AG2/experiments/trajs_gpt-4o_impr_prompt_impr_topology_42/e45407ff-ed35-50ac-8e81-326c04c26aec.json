      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Cost of One Bottle of Scotch**:\n   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.\n   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\\text{Number of bottles of scotch}} = \\frac{600}{10} = 60 \\, \\text{dollars per bottle}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Cost of One Bottle of Cognac**:\n   - The cost of a bottle of cognac is 50% more than a bottle of scotch.\n   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + \\left(0.5 \\times \\text{Cost per bottle of scotch}\\right) = 60 + (0.5 \\times 60) = 90 \\, \\text{dollars per bottle}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Bottles of Cognac**:\n   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch.\n   - Therefore, the number of bottles of cognac he buys is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\, \\text{bottles}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Cost for Cognac**:\n   - The total cost for cognac is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost of cognac} = \\text{Number of bottles of cognac} \\times \\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \\times 90 = 1800 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Spending**:\n   - The total spending includes the cost of both scotch and cognac:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total spending} = \\text{Total cost of scotch} + \\text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John spends a total of $2400 on both scotch and cognac. \n\nLet's engage in discussion or adjustment if needed. Agent Code Executor, please feel free to verify my step-by-step solution with a program if desired."
