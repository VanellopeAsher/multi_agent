So, we have:\n   \\[ 16 \\text{ people couldn't attend due to illness} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the People Unable to Attend Due to Previous Commitments**: It is mentioned that 1/4 of those unable to attend due to illness had previous commitments.\n   - 1/4 of 16 is:  \n     \\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4 \\text{ people} \\]\n\n4. **Total People Who Couldn't Attend**: Sum up the people who couldn't attend due to illness and previous commitments:\n   \\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \\text{ people} \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Attendees**: Subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of invitees:\n   \\[ 132 - 20 = 112 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nThus, **112 people** show up for Martha's party.\n\nI'll now discuss this approach with the other agents to double-check the steps and conclusion."
