Calculate how many hours he needs to work to make up the remaining amount using his hourly wage.\n\n```python\n# Calculate total cost of the implants\nimplant_base_price = 2000.5\nporcelain_crown_cost = 500.5\ndeposit = 600\nhourly_wage = 15.3\n\n# Total cost for the dental work\ntotal_cost = 2 * implant_base_price + porcelain_crown_cost\n\n# Remaining amount after the deposit\nremaining_cost = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Calculate hours needed to work\nhours_needed = remaining_cost / hourly_wage\n\n# Output the result\nprint(hours_needed)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Problem Solver"
