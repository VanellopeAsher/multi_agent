      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Stephen owes his sister, and then determine how much he will pay her in the twelfth month, excluding his purchases of coins. Hereâ€™s how we can approach this problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Debt with Interest**:\n   - Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister.\n   - He owes an additional 2% interest on this amount.\n   - The interest on $300 at 2% is \\(300 \\times 0.02 = 6\\).\n   - Therefore, the total amount he owes is \\(300 + 6 = 306\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid Over the First 11 Months**:\n   - Every month for 11 months, he pays his sister $25.\n   - This amounts to \\(25 \\times 11 = 275\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Remaining Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month**:\n   - After 11 months, Stephen would have paid $275 towards his debt.\n   - The remaining amount he owes is \\(306 - 275 = 31\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - In the twelfth month, Stephen will pay his sister the remaining $31.\n   - His coin purchasing habits do not affect the amount he will pay toward his loan, as we are explicitly asked to exclude coin purchases from the calculations.\n\nTherefore, Stephen will pay $31 to his sister in the twelfth month. Let's discuss to ensure this solution is accurate and clarify any potential doubts."
