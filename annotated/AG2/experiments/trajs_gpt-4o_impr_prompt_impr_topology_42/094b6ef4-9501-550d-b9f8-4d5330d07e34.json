Thus, their combined length is: \n   \\[\n   6 \\, \\text{inches} + 6 \\, \\text{inches} = 12 \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate the Length of the Remoras to the Shark's Length**: The problem states that the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) is 10% of the shark's body length. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shark's length} \\times 0.10 = 12 \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation**: To find the shark's body length, divide both sides of the equation by 0.10:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shark's length} = \\frac{12 \\, \\text{inches}}{0.10} = 120 \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the shark is 120 inches long. Let's discuss this solution to ensure clarity or if there are alternative approaches."

The combined length of the remoras is \\(12\\) inches.\n2. This combined length represents \\(10\\%\\) of the shark's total length.\n3.
