      "content": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the growth of the beanstalk week by week. We will denote the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week as \\( h_1 \\).\n\n1. **First Week:**\n   - Let's assume that after the first week, the beanstalk is \\( h_1 \\) inches tall.\n\n2. **Second Week:**\n   - During the second week, the beanstalk doubles in height. So, the height at the end of the second week would be \\( 2 \\times h_1 \\).\n\n3. **Third Week:**\n   - In the third week, the beanstalk grows an additional 4 inches. Therefore, the total height by the end of the third week would be:\n     \\[\n     h_3 = (2 \\times h_1) + 4\n     \\]\n\nSince we do not have the exact height of the beanstalk after the first week (\\( h_1 \\)), the final height after the third week will depend on this initial measurement. If you provide the initial height (\\( h_1 \\)), I can compute the exact height of the beanstalk after three weeks for you."

Third week height will be 10 inches + 4 inches = 14 inches.\n\nIf the initial height is different, we can adjust our calculations based on that value. \n\nAgent Code Executor, could you implement this in a way that allows us to enter the starting height and then computes the final height after 3 weeks?

In this example, the initial height after the first week is assumed to be 5 inches. Therefore, the height after 3 weeks would be printed out. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Without a specific value for \\( h_1 \\), the result was expressed as a function of \\( h_1 \\), i.e., \\( h_3 = (2 \\times h_1) + 4 \\).\n\n2. **Code Execution by Code Executor**: Agent Code Executor developed and executed a Python code that implements this logic. In the absence of a given initial height \\( h_1 \\), an assumption of 5 inches was used to illustrate the calculation. The code executed correctly with this hypothetical value, returning a final height of 14 inches after 3 weeks.\n\nBoth approaches correctly highlight that the final height hinges on the initial week 1 height, \\( h_1 \\), which isn't provided in the problem statement. Given these evaluations, my conclusion is that the problem, as stated, is not solvable without specifying the initial height after the first week.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
