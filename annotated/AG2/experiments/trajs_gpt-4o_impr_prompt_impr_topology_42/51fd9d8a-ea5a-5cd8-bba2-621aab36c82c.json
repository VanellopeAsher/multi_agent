Therefore, assuming John's age is \\( J \\), Paul’s age \\( P \\) is:\n     \\[\n     P = J + 0.1 \\times 100\n     \\]\n     Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     P = J + 10\n     \\]\n\n3. **Express Peter's Age**:\n   - Peter's age \\( Peter \\) is equal to the sum of Paul’s and John’s ages:\n     \\[\n     Peter = P + J\n     \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation for Total Age**:\n   - We know the total combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean adds up to 100 years. Let's denote Jean's age as \\( Jean \\):\n     \\[\n     Peter + P + J + Jean = 100\n     \\]\n\n5. **Substitute and Solve**:\n   - Substitute the expressions for Peter and Paul into the equation:\n     \\[\n     (P + J) + P + J + Jean = 100\n     \\]\n   - Substitute Paul's expression:\n     \\[\n     ((J + 10) + J) + (J + 10) + J + Jean = 100\n     \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     4J + 20 + Jean = 100\n     \\]\n   - Solve for Jean's age using the information provided.\n\nFrom these equations, we can proceed with calculations to find each individual's exact age. Let's perform these:\n\n- Simplify:\n  \\[\n  4J + 20 + Jean = 100 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  Jean = 100 - 20 - 4J\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  Jean = 80 - 4J\n  \\]\n\nIf more information was provided about any one of these individuals' exact ages, we can substitute back into this form to get specific numeric values. However, based on this format, you would insert known values to compute the others."
