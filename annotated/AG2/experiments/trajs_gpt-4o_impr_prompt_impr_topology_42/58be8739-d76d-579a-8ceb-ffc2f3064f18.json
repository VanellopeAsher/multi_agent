Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \\( T \\). According to the problem:\n\\[\n0.30 \\times T = 15\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( T \\):\n\\[\nT = \\frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the time spent sightseeing, subtract the time spent on other activities (15 hours) from the total vacation time:\n\\[\n\\text{Sightseeing time} = T - 15 = 50 - 15 = 35 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John spent 35 hours sightseeing."
