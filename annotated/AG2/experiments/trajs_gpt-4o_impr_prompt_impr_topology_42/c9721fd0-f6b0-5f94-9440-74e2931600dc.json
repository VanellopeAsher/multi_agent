Therefore, we consider it as 3 hours of work.\n   - Labor cost = 3 hours Ã— $35 per hour = $105.\n\n3. **Cost of Parts**: The cost of parts for the job was $60.\n\n4. **Total Amount Billed**:\n   - To find the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing, we need to sum up the service fee, labor costs, and cost of parts.\n   - Total cost = Service fee + Labor cost + Cost of parts = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205.\n\nThus, Patty's Plumbing would bill a total of $205 for the job."
