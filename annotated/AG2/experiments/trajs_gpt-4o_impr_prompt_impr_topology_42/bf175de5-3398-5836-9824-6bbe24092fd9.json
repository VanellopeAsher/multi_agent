Thus, the time taken for 5 individuals to paint the entire house is:\n\\[ \\frac{80 \\text{ hours}}{5 \\text{ individuals}} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nHence, it will take 5 individuals 16 hours to paint the entire house.\n\nLet's open the floor for discussion to ensure the accuracy and understanding of the solution."
