Hence, if Manny attends \\( x \\) classes, the cost per class should be \\( \\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20 \\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Inequality**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Inequality**:\n   - Multiply both sides of the inequality by \\( x \\) to get rid of the fraction:\n     \\[\n     80 \\leq 20x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 20 to isolate \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x \\geq 4\n     \\]\n\n5. **Interpret the Solution**: Manny must attend at least 4 classes for the cost per class to be $20 or less.\n\n6. **Calculate Classes He Can Miss**: Using the total number of classes (12):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Classes he can miss} = 12 - x = 12 - 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss up to 8 classes before his cost per class exceeds $20."
