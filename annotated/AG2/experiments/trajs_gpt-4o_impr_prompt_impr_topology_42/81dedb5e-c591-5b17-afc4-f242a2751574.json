Therefore, each part will have a length of:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{L}{4}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Second Division:**\n   - Each of these 4 parts is further divided into 5 equal parts. Therefore, each final piece will have a length of:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\frac{L}{4}}{5} = \\frac{L}{4 \\times 5} = \\frac{L}{20}\n     \\]\n\nThus, each final cut of the ribbon is \\(\\frac{L}{20}\\) in length.\n\n### Discussion\n\nWould anyone like to add anything or discuss any potential edge cases, such as considerations if \\( L \\) is not perfectly divisible by 20?"
