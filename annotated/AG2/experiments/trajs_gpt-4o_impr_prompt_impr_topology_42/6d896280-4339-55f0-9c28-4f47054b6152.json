Thus, the equation can be set up as:\n     \\[\n     x + x + 2x = 500\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\[\n     4x = 500\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.\n\nLet's discuss this solution to verify accuracy and clarity."
