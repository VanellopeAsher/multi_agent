Now we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n1. Cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n60x = 360 \\times 960\n\\]\n\n2. Calculate the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n60x = 345,600\n\\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 60 to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{345,600}{60}\n\\]\n\n4. Compute the division:\n\n\\[\nx = 5,760\n\\]\n\nThus, with 960 potatoes, you can make 5,760 hash browns."
