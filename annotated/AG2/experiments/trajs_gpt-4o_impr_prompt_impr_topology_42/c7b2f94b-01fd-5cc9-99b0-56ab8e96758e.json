Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break it down into smaller, manageable steps:\n\n1. **Identify the apples gathered by Joanne:**\n   - Tallest trees: Joanne gathers 30 apples.\n   - Shortest trees: Joanne gathers half of what she gathered from the tallest trees, so she gathers \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\) apples.\n   - Average trees: Joanne gathers 350 apples.\n\n   So total apples gathered by Joanne = 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + 350 (average) = 395 apples.\n\n2. **Identify how many apples Joanne's sister gathers:**\n   - Tallest trees: Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples as Joanne did, so she gathers \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\) apples.\n   - Shortest trees: Let's denote the number of apples her sister gathers from the shortest trees as \\( x \\).\n   - Average trees: She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.\n\n3. **Total apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister:**\n   According to the problem, both sisters together gather 500 apples.\n\n4. **Formulate the equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Apples gathered by Joanne} + \\text{Apples gathered by her sister} = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   395 + (60 + x) = 500\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Simplifying the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   395 + 60 + x = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   455 + x = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 500 - 455 = 45\n   \\]\n\n   So Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n\n6. **Determine how many times Joanne's sister gathers compared to Joanne from the shortest trees:**\n   Since Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees, the ratio of apples gathered by her sister to Joanne from the shortest trees is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{45}{15} = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees."
