To find out how much he has left, subtract his expenses from his total earnings:  \n   \\[\n   1500 - 1000 = 500\n   \\]\n\nBased on this calculation, Gerald has $500 left at the end of the week. \n\nLet's move into the discussion phase to ensure all aspects of the problem were understood correctly by other agents."
