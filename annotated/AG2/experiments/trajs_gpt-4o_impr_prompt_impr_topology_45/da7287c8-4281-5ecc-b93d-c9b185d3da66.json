Calculate the total earnings from milkshakes by multiplying the number of milkshakes by the price per milkshake.\n2. Calculate the total earnings from burger platters by multiplying the number of platters by the price per platter.\n3. Calculate the total earnings from sodas by first determining the number of sodas sold (half of 40), and then multiplying by the price per soda.\n4. Sum up all the earnings from milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas to find the total earnings.\n\nLet's go ahead and execute this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of milkshakes sold and price per milkshake\nmilkshakes_sold = 6\nprice_per_milkshake = 5.50\n\n# Number of burger platters sold and price per platter\nburger_platters_sold = 9\nprice_per_burger_platter = 11.5\n\n# Number of sodas (half of 40) and price per soda\nnumber_of_sodas = 40 / 2\nprice_per_soda = 1.50\n\n# Total earnings from milkshakes\ntotal_milkshake_earnings = milkshakes_sold * price_per_milkshake\n\n# Total earnings from burger platters\ntotal_burger_platter_earnings = burger_platters_sold * price_per_burger_platter\n\n# Total earnings from sodas\ntotal_soda_earnings = number_of_sodas * price_per_soda\n\n# Total earnings\ntotal_earnings = total_milkshake_earnings + total_burger_platter_earnings + total_soda_earnings\n\n# Print the total earnings\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Milkshakes**: Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each. Therefore, the total revenue from milkshakes is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 5.50 = 33.00\n   \\]\n\n2. **Burger Platters**: Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11.50 each. Therefore, the total revenue from burger platters is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 11.50 = 103.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sodas**: Terry sells half of 40 sodas, which is 20 sodas, for $1.50 each. Therefore, the total revenue from sodas is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 1.50 = 30.00\n   \\]\n\nAdding up all the revenues gives us the total money Terry makes:\n\\[\n33.00 + 103.50 + 30.00 = 166.50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Terry makes a total of $166.50 from these sales.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Verifier"
