So, the number of pieces in the second set is \\( 3 \\times 500 = 1500 \\).\n   - The third set has a quarter the number of pieces of the first set. So, the number of pieces in the third set is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125 \\).\n   - The fourth set has 125 more pieces than the first set. So, the number of pieces in the fourth set is \\( 500 + 125 = 625 \\).\n\n2. **Sum up all the legos:**\n   - Total pieces = Pieces in first set + Pieces in second set + Pieces in third set + Pieces in fourth set\n   - Total pieces = \\( 500 + 1500 + 125 + 625 = 2750 \\).\n\nSo, Johnny picks up a total of 2750 Lego pieces."
