Then, 30% of \\( T \\) is equal to 600 hours.\n   - \\( 0.30T = 600 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for Total Time \\( T \\)**:\n   - \\( T = \\frac{600}{0.30} = 2000 \\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing**:\n   - Sightseeing took up 40% of his time.\n   - Therefore, time spent sightseeing = 40% of his total time.\n   - Time spent sightseeing = \\( 0.40 \\times 2000 = 800 \\) hours.\n\nThus, John spent 800 hours sightseeing during his vacation. Now, I will discuss the solution with my teammates."
