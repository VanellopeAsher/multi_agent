Therefore, swimming time = \\( \\frac{6.6}{2} = 3.3 \\) hours.\n   - He watched 3 different shows, 2.5 hours each. Total time watching shows = \\( 3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the total vacation time**:  \n   From the problem statement, watching shows takes 30% of the total time. Therefore, 7.5 hours represents 30% of the total time.\n\n   - Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \\( T \\). Thus, \\( 0.3T = 7.5 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} = 25 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the time spent sightseeing**:  \n   - Sightseeing accounts for 40% of the total time.\n   - Thus, time spent sightseeing = \\( 0.4 \\times 25 = 10 \\) hours.\n\nTherefore, John spent 10 hours sightseeing.  \n\nFeel free to discuss or add to this analysis."
