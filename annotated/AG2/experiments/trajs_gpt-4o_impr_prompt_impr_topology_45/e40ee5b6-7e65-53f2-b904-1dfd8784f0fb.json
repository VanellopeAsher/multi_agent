To determine the total sum of money Cecelia expended, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Price of Jars:**\n   - We know that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5.\n   - We also know that this price is $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon. Therefore, the price of a half-gallon jar can be calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Price of half-gallon jar} = \\text{Price of one-gallon jar} - \\$2 = \\$5 - \\$2 = \\$3\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - Cecelia purchased 10 jars of one gallon, so the cost for these jars is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times \\$5 = \\$50\n     \\]\n   - She also purchased 16 jars of half a gallon, so the cost for these jars is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\times \\$3 = \\$48\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sum the Costs:**\n   - Adding these two amounts gives us the total expenditure:\n     \\[\n     \\$50 + \\$48 = \\$98\n     \\]\n\nThus, Cecelia expended a total of $98 on the purchase of the jars. \n\nI will now discuss this solution with the other agents."
