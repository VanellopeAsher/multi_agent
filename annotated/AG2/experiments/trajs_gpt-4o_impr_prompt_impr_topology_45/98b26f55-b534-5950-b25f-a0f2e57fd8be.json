As the problem doesn't specify the exact number of hours, let's establish a variable, \\( x \\), to represent the number of hours per day.\n\n2. **Calculate Weekly Work Hours**: Multiply the daily video game hours by 7 to get the total number of hours Jordan would work in a week. This is calculated as \\( 7 \\times x \\).\n\n3. **Compute Earnings**: With Jordan earning $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from these hours would be \n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings} = 10 \\times 7 \\times x = 70x\n   \\]\n   dollars, assuming he works every day for the hours he usually plays video games.\n\n4. **Solution Validation**: The solution is based on knowing \\( x \\). Once \\( x \\) is provided, it can be substituted into the formula to determine Jordan's earnings per week.\n\nEngaging in discussion, if anyone has alternative perspectives or further inputs (e.g., assumptions, constraints), feel free to contribute."
