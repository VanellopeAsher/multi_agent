      "content": "To solve this problem, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Eggs Found**:\n    - The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found \\(30 + 30 = 60\\) eggs.\n\n2. **Identify the Remaining Eggs**:\n    - We are told that all the other eggs, except 10, were found by their friends. \n\n3. **Calculate the Eggs Found by Friends**:\n    - This means that out of the total number of eggs, 10 eggs were not found by anyone.\n    - Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is calculated by subtracting the 60 eggs found by the twins and the 10 eggs not found from the total number of eggs.\n  \nLet's write it in a formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Eggs} = \\text{Eggs found by Smith twins} + \\text{Eggs found by friends} + \\text{Unfound eggs} \\]\n\nWe don't know the total number of eggs, only how many the friends found except 10 not found. Hence, the number of eggs found by friends should equate to the total number of eggs found minus those found by the twins minus the eggs left unfound.\n\nAssumption:\n- Total Eggs (including those unfound, but excluding unfound here for found calculation purposes)\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Eggs found by friends} = (\\text{Eggs found by Smith twins} + \\text{Eggs found by friends}) - \\text{Eggs found by Smith twins}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the unfound eggs into the calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Eggs found by friends} = ( \\text{all found eggs without 10}) - 60 \\]\nThus:\n\\[ (\\text{Unknown total found excluding 10}) - 60 = Total found - 60 = Friends found \n\nIn essence logic:\nEggs found by friends = Total eggs found  - (eggs found by smith and not found 10)\n=> Friends eggs = (total - 60) - 10\n\nWe do have eggs found \n(assumption Total found eggs if include not found => 70) known found by twins.\n\n```\n=> Friends eggs = Total known 70 - 60 - 10 \n=> Hence by surrogate of knowing known unknown friends, this leaves:\n=> Friends eggs where total comprise give found with fact except:\n=> Perspectively derived foundies to other is derivative of complete
