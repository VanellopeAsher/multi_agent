So, they watch \\(\\frac{4}{2} = 2\\) films each Sunday.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of films watched each weekend:**\n   - Each weekend, the total number of films watched is the sum of films watched on Saturday and Sunday: \\(4 \\, (\\text{Saturday}) + 2 \\, (\\text{Sunday}) = 6 \\, \\text{films per weekend}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of films watched over 4 weeks:**\n   - Since they follow this routine every weekend for 4 weeks, the total number of films watched over 4 weeks is: \\(6 \\, \\text{films/weekend} \\times 4 \\, \\text{weeks} = 24 \\, \\text{films}\\).\n\nThus, Jill and her companions can view a total of 24 films over a span of 4 weeks. \n\nLet's discuss this step with the other agents to confirm the approach and conclusion is agreeable."
