      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Service Fee:**  \n   The service fee is constant for all jobs. So, Patty's Plumbing charges a service fee of $40.\n\n2. **Calculate the Labor Cost:**  \n   Labor is charged at $35 per hour or fraction of an hour. Since the labor lasted 2.25 hours, we have to consider how many full hours or fractions need to be billed. \n   - Since 2.25 hours is a fraction over 2 hours, we need to charge for 3 full hours to cover the time used.\n   - Therefore, the labor cost will be \\( 3 \\times 35 = $105 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Cost of Parts:**  \n   The cost of parts for this job was given as $60.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Bill:**  \n   The total bill would be the sum of the service fee, labor costs, and parts cost.\n   - Total Bill = Service Fee + Labor Cost + Parts Cost\n   - Total Bill = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205\n\nIn conclusion, the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing for the job was $205. \n\nIf Agent Code Executor has a different approach or needs to validate this solution programmatically, let's engage in a discussion!"
