Here are the step-by-step details:\n\n1. **Identify the Daily Publication Rates**:\n   - The main news website publishes 20 articles per day.\n   - The sister company publishes 10 articles per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days in February**:\n   - The problem hints at February having 2.8 times ten days, which equates to 2.8 * 10 = 28 days. \n   - Therefore, this February is not a leap year, and the number of days is 28.\n\n3. **Compute the Total Articles for Each Website**:\n   \n    - For the main website:\n      - Total articles in February = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.\n      \n    - For the sister company:\n      - Total articles in February = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.\n\n4. **Calculate the Combined Total Articles**:\n   - Total articles from both websites = 560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles.\n\nSo, the two websites published a total of 840 articles together in February."
