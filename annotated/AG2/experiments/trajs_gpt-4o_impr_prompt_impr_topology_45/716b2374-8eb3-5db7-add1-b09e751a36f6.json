He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weekly expenses for Kim's housekeeping business and use the details given to figure out the cost of each pack of cloths.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Clients:**\n   - Kim has 3 existing clients.\n   - He is in talks with 5 more potential clients.\n   - **Total number of clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.**\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Items Needed for Cleaning:**\n   - Each client's home requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.\n   - For 8 clients, Kim will need:\n     - **Number of bleach bottles = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles.**\n     - **Number of cloth packs = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.**\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost of Bleach:**\n   - Each bottle of bleach costs $2.\n   - **Total cost for bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32.**\n\n4. **Determine Weekly Expenses:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the cost of one pack of cloths.\n   - Total expense for cloths = 8 packs * \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Write the Equation for Total Expenses:**\n   - Total expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths.\n   - **Total expenses = $32 + 8x.**\n\n6. **Use the Profit Equation:**\n   - Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses.\n   - Given, Profit = $20 and Total Income = $92.\n   - Thus, $20 = $92 - Total Expenses.\n   - **Total Expenses = $92 - $20 = $72.**\n\n7. **Set up the Equation and Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - $32 + 8x = $72.\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     8x = 72 - 32 \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     8x = 40 \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 40 / 8 \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 5 \n     \\]\n\nHence, the cost of each pack of cloths is $5.\n"
