We are given that the mean score is 70 and that she has 9 scores in total.\n2. Therefore, the sum of all 9 scores should be equal to 70 multiplied by 9 because mean = (sum of scores) / 9.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of all scores} = 70 \\times 9 = 630\n   \\]\n\n3. Sally's known scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70. Let's calculate their sum.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of known scores} = 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570\n   \\]\n\n4. Let \\( x \\) be the forgotten score.
