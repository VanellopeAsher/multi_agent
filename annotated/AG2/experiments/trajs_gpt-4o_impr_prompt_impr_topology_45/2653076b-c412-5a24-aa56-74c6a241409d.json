So, the cost for the croissants is \\(5 \\times 3.50 = \\$17.50\\).\n   - **Cinnamon Rolls**: Marcus ordered 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each. Thus, the cinnamon roll cost is \\(4 \\times 2.50 = \\$10.00\\).\n   - **Mini Quiches**: He ordered 3 mini quiches at $4.50 each. Therefore, their total cost is \\(3 \\times 4.50 = \\$13.50\\).\n   - **Blueberry Muffins**: He purchased 13 blueberry muffins at $1.50 each, leading to a total muffin cost of \\(13 \\times 1.50 = \\$19.50\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the subtotal before applying the discount:**\n   - Add all the individual costs we calculated in step 1:\n     \\[\n     \\$17.50 (Croissants) + \\$10.00 (Cinnamon Rolls) + \\$13.50 (Mini Quiches) + \\$19.50 (Blueberry Muffins) = \\$60.50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Apply the 10% loyalty card discount:**\n   - First, determine the discount amount by calculating 10% of the subtotal:\n     \\[\n     \\$60.50 \\times 0.10 = \\$6.05\n     \\]\n   - Subtract the discount from the subtotal to get the final total:\n     \\[\n     \\$60.50 - \\$6.05 = \\$54.45\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Marcus' total bill, after applying the 10% discount, is **$54.45**."
