      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the distribution of the kids and the seashells they collected.\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Boys and Girls**:  \n   Since the children were divided equally into two groups of boys and girls, and there are 200 kids in total, we can calculate the number of boys and girls as follows:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = \\text{Number of girls} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Shells Collected by the Boys**:  \n   Each boy collected 600 shells. Therefore, the total number of shells collected by the boys is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells by boys} = 100 \\times 600 = 60,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Shells Collected by the Girls**:  \n   According to the problem, the girls collected a number of shells equal to what the boys collected plus four times as many shells as the boys. This translates to:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells by girls} = \\text{Total shells by boys} + 4 \\times \\text{Total shells by boys} = 60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 300,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Shells Collected by Each Girl**:  \n   Each girl collected an equal number of shells. Given there are 100 girls, the number of shells collected by each girl is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Shells per girl} = \\frac{\\text{Total shells by girls}}{\\text{Number of girls}} = \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each girl collected 3,000 seashells."
