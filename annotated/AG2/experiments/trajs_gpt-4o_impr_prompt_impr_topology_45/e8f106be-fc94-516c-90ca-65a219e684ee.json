      "content": "To solve this problem regarding how much crepe-paper streamer James needs to hang around his backyard fence, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Fence Layout**: \n   - James' backyard fence is a rectangular shape.\n   - The dimensions of the fence are given as 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Fence**: \n   - The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is calculated by the formula: \n     \\[\n     P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the dimensions of the fence:\n     \\[\n     P = 2 \\times (20 \\, \\text{feet} + 15 \\, \\text{feet}) = 2 \\times 35 \\, \\text{feet} = 70 \\, \\text{feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Account for Any Interruptions or Omissions**:\n   - The problem mentions a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall. However, it specifies that no streamers are hung on the tree. Since the problem focuses only on the fence perimeter, the tree does not affect the perimeter calculation.\n\n4. **Determine the Length of Crepe Paper Needed**: \n   - Since there are no other interruptions mentioned regarding the fence (such as gates or areas where streamers should not be hung), James will need a complete coverage around the perimeter of the fence.\n\nThus, according to the calculations, James needs a total of **70 feet** of crepe paper to hang around his backyard fence.\n\nPlease, let's discuss this approach and verify the solution before confirming it."
