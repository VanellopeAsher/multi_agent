This does not affect the calculation since it states that he needs to memorize 15 lines in this scene regardless.\n\n3. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize**:\n   - His lines in the solo song = 54\n   - His lines in the first scene = 36\n   - His required lines in the second scene = 15 (due to the absent actor)\n\nAdd them up to get the total number of lines:\n\\[\n\\text{Total lines Sean has to memorize} = 54 + 36 + 15 = 105\n\\]\n\nThus, Sean needs to memorize a total of 105 lines."
