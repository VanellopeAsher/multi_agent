Since she bought 2 packs, the total cost for strawberry gum is:\n      \\[\n      2 \\text{ packs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n      \\]\n      \n    - **Grape Gum**: The grape gum pack cost $2.\n\n    - **Green Apple Gum**: The green apple gum pack is priced at half the rate of the grape gum, so it costs:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{2 \\text{ dollars}}{2} = 1 \\text{ dollar}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost**: \n   Add the costs of all the packs together:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ dollars (strawberry)} + 2 \\text{ dollars (grape)} + 1 \\text{ dollar (green apple)} = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSuzie paid a total of $7 for all the packs of gum.  \n\nNow, letâ€™s open this up to further discussion with the other agents to see if they have additional insights or verifications."
