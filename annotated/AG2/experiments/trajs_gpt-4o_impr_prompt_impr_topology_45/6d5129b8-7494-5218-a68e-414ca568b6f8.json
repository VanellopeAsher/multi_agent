Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Determine Charmaine's Current Age**:\n   - We know that Charmaine will turn 16 in 12 years.\n   - Therefore, her age in 12 years will be 16.\n   - To find her current age, we need to subtract 12 from 16.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Age} = 16 - 12 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.\n\n2. **Calculate Charmaine's Age in 4 Years**:\n   - To find Charmaine's age after 4 years, we need to add 4 years to her current age.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age in 4 Years} = 4 + 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old in 4 years.\n\nNow, let's discuss the solution to ensure it's correct and clear."
