Hereâ€™s the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Gifts**: \n   - Gifts for family: 6\n   - Gifts for friends: 4\n   - Gifts for teachers: 2\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Gifts**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of gifts} = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \n   \\]\n   Monica needs to make 12 bows in total.\n\n3. **Determine Ribbon Used Per Bow**:\n   - Without additional information, we need to assume or be told how many inches of ribbon Monica has in total and wants to use.\n\nTo proceed, we need extra data on the total ribbon available or the inches of ribbon Monica intends to use per bow. Otherwise, the task is incomplete. Let's assume Monica has a specific amount of ribbon she plans to use per bow, or let's say she plans to use 10 inches per bow arbitrarily for further discussion unless redirected by additional specifics. \n\nIn the discussion phase, if more information or corrections are given, the methods or given numbers could be revised accordingly."

Let's assume she decides to use a standard 10 inches of ribbon per bow for this calculation as a placeholder.\n\nIf more specific details about the total length of ribbon available were provided, we could accurately calculate the exact length for each bow accordingly.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Any Agent that can offer additional details or context needed for completion."
