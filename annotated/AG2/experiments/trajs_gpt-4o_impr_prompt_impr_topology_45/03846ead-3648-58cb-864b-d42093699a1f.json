(Note: This likely means 'three times as many').\n   - Mary's points = 3 times Tim's points\n   - Mary's points = \\(3 \\times 38 = 114\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Points of the Class:**\n   - Total points = Alex's points + Bella's points + Tim's points + Mary's points\n   - Total points = \\(60 + 78 + 38 + 114 = 290\\).\n\n5. **Determine Points Needed for the Trip:**\n   - Minimum threshold = 500 points.\n   - Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points\n   - Points missing = \\(500 - 290 = 210\\).\n\nTherefore, class 3B is missing 210 points to reach the minimum threshold for the field trip. \n\nLet me know if there are any discrepancies or if further discussion is needed!"
