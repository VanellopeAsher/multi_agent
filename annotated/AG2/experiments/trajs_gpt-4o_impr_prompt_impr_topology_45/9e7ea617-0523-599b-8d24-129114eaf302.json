Therefore, the height of the second tree is:  \n     \\[\n     60 + 50 = 110 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Combined Height of the First Two Trees**:\n   - Add the heights of the shortest and the second tree:  \n     \\[\n     60 + 110 = 170 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Height of the Tallest Tree**:\n   - The tallest tree's height is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 170 = 340 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the height of the tallest tree is 340 feet."
