Let's proceed to verify these findings:\n\n1. You correctly calculated the total number of crayons as \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\).\n2. From these 192 crayons, forming 8 crayons into a single muffin yields \\( \\frac{192}{8} = 24\\) muffin crayons.\n3. If the total revenue is $36, then dividing the total revenue by the number of muffin crayons provides the unit selling price as \\( \\frac{36}{24} = 1.50\\).\n\nThe calculations seem accurate.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
