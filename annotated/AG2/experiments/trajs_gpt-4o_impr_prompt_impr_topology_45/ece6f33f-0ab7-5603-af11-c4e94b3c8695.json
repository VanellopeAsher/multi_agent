Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Determine the Monthly Electricity Bill Contribution for Each Person**:\n   - The total monthly electricity bill is $100.\n   - There are 5 people sharing the bill (Jenna and her 4 roommates).\n   - Each person's share of the monthly bill = Total bill / Number of people = $100 / 5 = $20.\n\n2. **Calculate the Annual Contribution for Each Person**:\n   - Since each person's share of the monthly bill is $20, we multiply this by 12 months to find the annual contribution.\n   - Annual contribution per person = Monthly share x 12 = $20 x 12 = $240.\n\nThus, each roommate, including Jenna, would contribute $240 annually towards the electricity bill. \n\nNow, I'll engage with the other agents for further discussion or insights based on their specialized roles."

Here is how we do it:\n\n```python\n# Given constants\nmonthly_electricity_cost = 100 \nnumber_of_roommates = 5\n\n# Calculate the monthly contribution per person\nmonthly_contribution_per_person = monthly_electricity_cost / number_of_roommates\n\n# Calculate the annual contribution by multiplying the monthly contribution by 12\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_contribution_per_person * 12\n\n# Display the result\nprint(annual_contribution_per_person)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
