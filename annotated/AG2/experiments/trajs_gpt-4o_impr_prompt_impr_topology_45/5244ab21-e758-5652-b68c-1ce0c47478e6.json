Let's break down the problem and calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold:\n\n1. **Total Boxes Purchased**: Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.\n   \n2. **Oranges Per Box**: Each box contains 20 oranges.\n   \n3. **Total Oranges**:  \n   - Total number of oranges = 12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges.\n\n4. **Oranges Gifted**:  \n   - Mrs. Harrington gave away 2 boxes to her mother and 2 boxes to her sibling.\n   - Total boxes gifted = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.\n   - Oranges gifted = 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.\n   \n5. **Remaining Oranges**:  \n   - Remaining oranges after gifting = Total oranges - Oranges gifted = 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.\n   \n6. **Oranges Retained**:  \n   - Mrs. Harrington retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself.\n   - Oranges retained = (1/4) * 160 oranges = 40 oranges. \n\n7. **Oranges Sold**:  \n   - Oranges sold = Remaining oranges - Oranges retained = 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges. \n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to discuss or explore further!"
