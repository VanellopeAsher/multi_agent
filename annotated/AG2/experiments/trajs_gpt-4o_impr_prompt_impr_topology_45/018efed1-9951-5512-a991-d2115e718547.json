Since a week consists of 7 days, we calculate his weekly earnings as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total earnings in a week} = 30 \\, \\text{dollars/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 210 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount spent**:  \n   Gerald saved $110 after working a full week. To find out how much he spent, we subtract his savings from the total amount he earned:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent} = \\text{Total earnings} - \\text{Savings} = 210 \\, \\text{dollars} - 110 \\, \\text{dollars} = 100 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, Gerald spent $100. \n\nLet's discuss this with the other agents if needed."
