Since each $10 bill contributes 10 dollars, the total amount contributed by the $10 bills is \\( 10x \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Money**:\n   Ali also has six $20 bills, totaling \\( 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\) dollars.\n   Therefore, the total initial amount of money Ali has is:\n   \\[\n   10x + 120\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find Half of the Total Money**:\n   Ali gives half of his total money to his sister:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Remaining Money After Giving to Sister**:\n   After giving money to his sister, the remaining amount is:\n   \\[\n   10x + 120 - \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{2(10x + 120) - (10x + 120)}{2}\n   = \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Money Spent on Dinner**:\n   Ali spends 3/5 of the remaining money on dinner:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Set Up the Equation for Money Left**:\n   After spending on dinner, Ali has $32 left:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{10x + 120}{2} = 32\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solve the Equation**:\n   Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times (10x + 120) = 32\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by 5:\n   \\[\n   10x + 120 = 160\n   \\]\n   Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   10x = 160 - 120\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10x = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Ali originally has 4 $10 bills. \n\nI will now engage in discussion to verify my approach and answer."
