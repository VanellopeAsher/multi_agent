Mark lost 30 pounds during the illness period.\n2. Mark regained 10 pounds during the recovery period.\n3. The net weight change was a loss of 20 pounds altogether.\n4. Given the final weight of 70 pounds, adding back the 20-pound loss, we reach the initial weight calculation.\n\nBoth the logical explanation and the Python code confirm that Mark's initial weight was indeed 90 pounds.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{90}**"
