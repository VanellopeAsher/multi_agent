Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate Weekly Classes:**\n   - Judy teaches 5 classes each day from Monday to Friday.\n   - She teaches 8 classes on Saturday.\n   - She takes a break on Sunday and doesn't teach any classes.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is:\n   \\[\n   (5 \\text{ classes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days}) + 8 \\text{ classes on Saturday} = 25 + 8 = 33 \\text{ classes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Students per Week:**\n   - Each class has 15 students.\n   - Total number of students attending classes each week:\n     \\[\n     33 \\text{ classes} \\times 15 \\text{ students/class} = 495 \\text{ student attendances per week}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Earnings:**\n   - Judy charges $15.00 per student for each class.\n   - Therefore, her total earnings for the week are:\n     \\[\n     495 \\text{ student attendances} \\times \\$15.00/\\text{student} = \\$7,425.00\n     \\]\n\nSo, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week."
