The total spending is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   500 + 1900 = 2400\n   \\]\n5. **Remaining Money**: Subtract the total spending from the total amount available:\n   \\[\n   3200 - 2400 = 800\n   \\]\n\nThus, Raymond has $800 left after his spending.\n\nNow, I will discuss this approach and calculations with Agent Code Executor."
