Let \\( x \\) represent the total number of daily flights by the first aircraft.\n\n2. According to the problem, the second aircraft makes 44 flights to Poland, and this number is half of the total flights of the first aircraft. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 88\n   \\]\n   Hence, the first aircraft makes 88 flights daily.\n\n3. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n   \\]\n\n4. The remaining flights are flown to France and Germany, and are evenly divided between them. The remaining number of flights is:\n   \\[\n   88 - 66 = 22\n   \\]\n\n5. Since the flights to France and Germany are evenly divided, the number of flights to each destination is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n   \\]\n\nThus, the first aircraft makes 11 daily flights to France."

The total number of flights by the first aircraft is calculated from the flights by the second aircraft (44 flights), leading to \\( x = 88 \\) for the first aircraft because 44 represents half of the first aircraft's flights.\n\n2. Out of these 88 flights, three-fourths go to Greece, which calculates to 66 flights.\n\n3. The remaining flights (88 - 66 = 22 flights) are split equally between France and Germany.\n\n4.
