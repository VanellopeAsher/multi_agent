Here’s the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( P \\) be Peter's age.\n   - Let \\( L \\) be Paul's age.\n   - Let \\( J \\) be John's age.\n\n2. **Translate Words into Equations**:\n   \n   - The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 0.1 times one thousand years old. This means:\n   \\[\n   P + L + J = 0.1 \\times 1000 = 100\n   \\]\n   \n   - Paul is 0.1 times one hundred years older than John, meaning:\n   \\[\n   L = J + 0.1 \\times 100 = J + 10\n   \\]\n   \n   - Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:\n   \\[\n   P = L + J\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute to Solve**:\n\n   First, substitute the value of \\( L \\) from the second equation into the third equation:\n   \\[\n   P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10\n   \\]\n\n   Now substitute this expression for \\( P \\) and the value of \\( L \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify and Solve for \\( J \\)**:\n   \\[\n   2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4J + 20 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4J = 80\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   J = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find \\( L \\) and \\( P \\) Using \\( J \\)**:\n   Using \\( J = 20 \\),\n   \\[\n   L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   P = 2J + 10 = 2 \\times 20 + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\nSo, Peter's age is 50 years."
