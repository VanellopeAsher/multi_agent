Fabric for the Comforter\n\n- **Dimensions of the Bed**: 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.\n- Jim wants the comforter to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\n\nThus, the dimensions of each piece of fabric for the comforter will be:\n- Length: \\(6 \\, \\text{feet} + 2 \\, \\text{feet} = 8 \\, \\text{feet}\\)\n- Width: \\(8 \\, \\text{feet} + 2 \\, \\text{feet} = 10 \\, \\text{feet}\\)\n\nThe area of one piece of fabric is:\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{\\text{comforter}} = 8 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 10 \\, \\text{feet} = 80 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\nSince he needs two pieces:\n\\[ \\text{Total Area}_{\\text{comforter}} = 2 \\times 80 \\, \\text{square feet} = 160 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\n### 2. Fabric for the Duvet Cover\n\n- Dimensions needed are already provided: 9 feet long by 11 feet wide.\n\nThe area for the duvet cover is:\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{\\text{duvet}} = 9 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 11 \\, \\text{feet} = 99 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\n### Total Fabric Required\n\nAdding the fabric needed for both the comforter and the duvet cover:\n\\[ \\text{Total Fabric} = \\text{Total Area}_{\\text{comforter}} + \\text{Area}_{\\text{duvet}} = 160 \\, \\text{square feet} + 99 \\, \\text{square feet} = 259 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy **259 square feet** of fabric in total.\n\nI am now ready to discuss my approach and see if there are any other perspectives or potential improvements from the team."
