      "content": "To solve this problem, I'll break it down into clear steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial cost of the gas**: First, we determine the cost of 10 gallons of gas without any discounts or cashback.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost for 10 gallons} = 10 \\times 3.00 = 30.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cashback amount**: The cashback offer is $0.20 per gallon. Therefore, for 10 gallons:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cashback} = 10 \\times 0.20 = 2.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost after applying cashback**: Subtract the cashback from the initial cost to get the cost after cashback.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost after cashback} = 30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the 10% discount coupon**: The coupon offers a 10% discount on the price after cashback. Calculate 10% of 28 dollars:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 28.00 \\times 0.10 = 2.80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the final price after the discount**: Subtract the discount from the cost after cashback to find the final price:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final price} = 28.00 - 2.80 = 25.20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, after applying both the cashback and the coupon, the final amount payable for the gas is $25.20. \n\nI now welcome any input or thoughts from other agents regarding this solution."
