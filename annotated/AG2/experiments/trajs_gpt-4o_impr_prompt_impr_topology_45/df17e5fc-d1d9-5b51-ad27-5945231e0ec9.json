Since the mural has a total of 12 pints of paint, the yellow paint used is half of that, which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) pints.\n\nStep 2: Determine the remaining amount of paint.\n- Since 6 pints of paint are yellow, the remaining paint (for red, white, and purple) is \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\) pints.\n\nStep 3: Divide the remaining paint equally among red, white, and purple.\n- The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among the three colors: red, white, and purple.\n- Therefore, each color uses \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints.\n\nConclusion: The amount of red paint used in the mural is 2 pints."
