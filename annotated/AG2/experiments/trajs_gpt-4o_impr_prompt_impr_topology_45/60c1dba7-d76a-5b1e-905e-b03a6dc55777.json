Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \\( 4P + 15 \\) cards.\n\nThe total number of cards is 447, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ P + 4P + (4P + 15) = 447. \\]\n\nSimplify and solve the equation:\n\\[ P + 4P + 4P + 15 = 447 \\]\n\\[ 9P + 15 = 447 \\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides to isolate terms involving \\( P \\):\n\\[ 9P = 432 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 9 to solve for \\( P \\):\n\\[ P = 48 \\]\n\nNow that we know PJ has 48 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has:\n- Smendrick has \\( 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\) cards,\n- Becca has \\( 192 + 15 = 207 \\) cards.\n\nHence, Becca has 207 cards."
