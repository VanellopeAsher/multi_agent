Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n     \\[\n     0.10 \\times S = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(S\\)**:\n   - To find the length of the shark (\\(S\\)), we need to solve the equation:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{12}{0.10}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(S\\):\n     \\[\n     S = 120\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The length of the shark is 120 inches. \n\nDoes anyone have questions, or is there anything that we should verify or discuss further?"
