      "content": "To solve this problem, I'll calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and how this relates to her time spent. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Determine Articles Written on Monday:**  \n   Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.\n\n2. **Calculate Articles Written on Tuesday:**  \n   Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 5\\right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ articles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Hours Spent on Monday and Tuesday:**  \n   Each article takes 4 hours to write.\n   - Hours on Monday: \\(5 \\text{ articles} \\times 4 \\text{ hours/article} = 20 \\text{ hours}\\)\n   - Hours on Tuesday: \\(7 \\text{ articles} \\times 4 \\text{ hours/article} = 28 \\text{ hours}\\)\n\n4. **Calculate Hours and Articles on Wednesday:**  \n   Total hours spent over the three days is 104 hours. Thus, hours on Wednesday are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hours on Wednesday} = 104 - (20 + 28) = 56 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Articles on Wednesday are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Articles on Wednesday} = \\frac{56 \\text{ hours}}{4 \\text{ hours/article}} = 14 \\text{ articles}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Relationship Between Articles Written on Tuesday and Wednesday:**  \n   Meredith wrote 7 articles on Tuesday and 14 articles on Wednesday. Therefore, she wrote:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14 \\text{ articles on Wednesday}}{7 \\text{ articles on Tuesday}} = 2 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\nMeredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday."
