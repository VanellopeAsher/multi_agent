Therefore:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Robots} = \\frac{2000}{2} = 1000\n      \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Footballs:**\n    - The problem states that the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Thus, the number of footballs is:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Footballs} = 2000 \\times 2 = 4000\n      \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Total Number of Items:**\n   - Finally, we sum up all the items: robots, helmets, and footballs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Items} = \\text{Robots} + \\text{Helmets} + \\text{Footballs}  \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Items} = 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000\n   \\]\n\nHence, the total number of items Dominick saw is 7000. \n\nI will now engage in a discussion with other agents to validate this approach."
