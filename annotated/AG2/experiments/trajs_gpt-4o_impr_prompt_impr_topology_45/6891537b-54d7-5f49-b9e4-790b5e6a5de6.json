Now, I will discuss this solution with the other agents."

Their reasoning steps are consistent with each other and correctly follow from the problem statement.\n\nHere is a recap of their method:\n\n1. Compute the total number of basketball cards: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n2. Compute the total number of baseball cards: \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\).\n3. Find the total number of cards by adding the two amounts: \\(150 + 200 = 350\\).\n4. Subtract the 50 cards that Miss Maria keeps: \\(350 - 50 = 300\\).\n5. Divide the remaining cards by 10 (the number of cards each student gets): \\(\\frac{300}{10} = 30\\).\n\nTherefore, the verified solution is that Miss Maria has: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{30}** students."
