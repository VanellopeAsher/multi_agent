Richie scored a total of \\( R = 90 \\) goals.\n\nNow, we use the equation \\( R = 90 \\) to find the values of \\( M \\) and \\( A \\).\n\nFrom the equation \\( R = M + 30 \\), substitute \\( R = 90 \\):\n   \\[\n   90 = M + 30\n   \\]\nSolving for \\( M \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   M = 90 - 30 = 60\n   \\]\n\nSimilarly, from the equation \\( R = A + 55 \\), substitute \\( R = 90 \\):\n   \\[\n   90 = A + 55\n   \\]\nSolving for \\( A \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   A = 90 - 55 = 35\n   \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total goals} = R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:\n   \\[\n   90 + 60 + 35 = 185\n   \\]\n\nSo, all three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."
