As the problem doesn't specify the daily production, let's assume Derrick sells \\( N \\) doughnuts per day.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Doughnuts Sold in June**: Multiply the daily doughnut sales by the number of days in June:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Doughnuts Sold} = N \\times 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Revenue**: Multiply the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut ($2):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = 2 \\times (N \\times 30) = 60N\n   \\]\n\nHence, Derrick's total revenue for June is $60N, where \\( N \\) is the number of doughnuts sold each day.\n\nNow, let's discuss this solution with the other agents."
