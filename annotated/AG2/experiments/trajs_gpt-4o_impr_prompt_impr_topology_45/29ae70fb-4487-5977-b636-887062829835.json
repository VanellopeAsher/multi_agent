      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Karate classes Manny can miss while keeping the cost per class under $10. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the total cost and number of classes**:  \n   - Total cost for Karate classes is $60.\n   - There are 10 Karate classes in total.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost per class if all classes are attended**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per class} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Total number of classes}} = \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n   If Manny attends all classes, the cost is $6 per class, which is under the $10 limit.\n\n3. **Set up the condition for the maximum cost per attended class**:  \n   Manny’s parents don't want to pay more than $10 per class. If \\( x \\) represents the number of classes Manny attends, and these classes are paid for, then we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the inequality**:  \n   To find the maximum value of \\( x \\), solve:\n   \\[\n   60 \\leq 10x \\implies x \\geq \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n   This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to maintain a cost of $10 per class or less.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss**:  \n   Since there are originally 10 classes, if Manny attends at least 6, he can miss:\n   \\[\n   10 - 6 = 4 \\text{ classes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10."
