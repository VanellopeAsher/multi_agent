She cuts this wire into several pieces, and ends up with 8 pieces.\n3. We need to find out how many inches long each piece is.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches:**\n   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a wire that is 4 feet long is equivalent to:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches per foot} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide the total length of the wire by the number of pieces:**\n   Tracy has divided the wire into 8 equal pieces. Therefore, the length of each piece is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{48 \\text{ inches}}{8 \\text{ pieces}} = 6 \\text{ inches per piece}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, each piece is 6 inches long. \n\nI'll discuss this approach with the other agents to ensure clarity and accuracy."
