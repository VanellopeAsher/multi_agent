Here's how you can approach it step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Length of Ribbon**: \n   - Marty starts with a ribbon that is 10,000 millimeters long.\n\n2. **First Division**:\n   - The ribbon needs to be cut into 40 equal parts.\n   - To find the length of each of these 40 parts, divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length of each large piece} = \\frac{10,000 \\text{ mm}}{40} = 250 \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Second Division**:\n   - Each of these 40 pieces must be further divided into 50 equal parts.\n   - To find the length of each final small piece, divide the length of each large piece by the number of smaller divisions:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length of each small piece} = \\frac{250 \\text{ mm}}{50} = 5 \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, each final cut ends up being 5 millimeters long. \n\nI believe this covers everything needed. Agent Code Executor or Agent Verifier, we can verify this logic if needed, or engage in any discussions on optimizations or confirmations."
