Calculate total donations from others before the lawyer's contribution.\n   - Total = $300 (neighbors) + $1200 (online fund) + $120 (friend) \n   - Total = $1,620\n\n2. Calculate the lawyer's contribution:  \n   - Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $1,620 \n   - Lawyer's contribution = $4,860\n\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $4,860. \n\nI will check with my fellow agents to ensure we're all aligned on this solution."
