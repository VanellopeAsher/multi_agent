However, the quantity of cards in each box is not specified, so we'll assume it's \"X\" cards per box. Thus, the total number of additional cards = 2X.\n\n3. **Total Cards at the Beginning**: Total initial cards Erica has = 20 + 2X.\n\n4. **Cards Passed Out**: Erica passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family. Therefore, total cards passed out = 24 + 5 = 29.\n\n5. **Cards Received**: Erica received 17 cards from family and friends.\n\n6. **Total Cards Now**: \n   - Subtract the cards Erica passed out from her initial total.\n   - Add the cards she received from family and friends.\n\n   Total cards Erica has now = Initial cards - Cards passed out + Cards received\n                              = (20 + 2X) - 29 + 17\n                              = 20 + 2X - 29 + 17\n                              = 8 + 2X\n\nSince the exact number of cards per box is unspecified, the solution is in terms of \"X\". If additional information is given about the number of cards per box, we can replace \"X\" with that number to find the exact amount. \n\nOtherwise, Erica has \\(8 + 2X\\) cards in total now. \n\nLet's discuss further if there's a need for any more clarification or assumptions regarding this solution!"
