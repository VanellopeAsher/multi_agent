Here's how we can approach it step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( P \\) be Peter's age.\n   - Let \\( L \\) be Paul's age.\n   - Let \\( J \\) be Jean's age.\n\n2. **Use the Given Information:**\n   - From the problem, we have the equation: \n     \\[\n     P + L + J = 100\n     \\]\n   - We are told that Paul is 18 years older than Jean: \n     \\[\n     L = J + 18\n     \\]\n   - Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \n     \\[\n     P = L + J\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute and Solve:**\n   - Substitute \\( L = J + 18 \\) into the equation \\( P = L + J \\):\n     \\[\n     P = (J + 18) + J = 2J + 18\n     \\]\n   - Now substitute \\( P = 2J + 18 \\) and \\( L = J + 18 \\) into the combined age equation:\n     \\[\n     (2J + 18) + (J + 18) + J = 100\n     \\]\n   - Simplify and solve for \\( J \\):\n     \\[\n     4J + 36 = 100\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4J = 64\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     J = 16\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Ages:**\n   - Insert \\( J = 16 \\) back into the equations for \\( L \\) and \\( P \\):\n     \\[\n     L = J + 18 = 16 + 18 = 34\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P = 2J + 18 = 2(16) + 18 = 32 + 18 = 50\n     \\]\n\nPeter is 50 years old. \n\nI look forward to discussing this approach with the team to ensure the solution aligns with each agent's methodology."
