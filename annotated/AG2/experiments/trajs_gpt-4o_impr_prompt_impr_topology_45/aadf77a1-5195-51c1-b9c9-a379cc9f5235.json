They calculated the areas contributed by medium and large t-shirts and then determined how many small t-shirts were needed to complete the quilt's total area of 101 square feet.\n\nThe breakdown of the process is clear:\n- Medium t-shirts contribute 32 square feet.\n- Large t-shirts contribute 36 square feet.\n- The remaining 33 square feet must be covered by small t-shirts.\n- Since each small t-shirt covers 3 square feet, we need \\( \\frac{33}{3} = 11 \\) small t-shirts.\n\nThe verification of the calculation by executing code also supports these findings.
