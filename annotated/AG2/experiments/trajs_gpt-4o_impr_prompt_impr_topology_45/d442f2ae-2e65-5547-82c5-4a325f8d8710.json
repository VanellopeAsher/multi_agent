Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of Goats**: John buys 3 goats, each costing $500. Therefore, the total cost for goats is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 500 = 1500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost of Cows**: John buys 2 cows, each costing $1500. Therefore, the total cost for cows is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 1500 = 3000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Money Spent**: To find out how much John spent in total, we add the amount spent on goats and cows:\n   \\[\n   1500 + 3000 = 4500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consider the Horse**: Although John considers buying a horse for $2000, he decides not to purchase it. Thus, this does not add to the total spending.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The total money John spent at the market is $4500.\n\nDoes anyone have questions, or is there anything that we should verify or discuss further?"
