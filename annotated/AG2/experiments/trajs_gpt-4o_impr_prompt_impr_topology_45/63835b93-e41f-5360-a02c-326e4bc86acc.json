Therefore, the total cost of the broken vases is:  \n   \\(3 \\times 15 = 45\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Neutering Cost} + \\text{Vaccine Costs} + \\text{Broken Vases Cost} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 150 + 60 + 45 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 255 \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the kitten so far is $255."
