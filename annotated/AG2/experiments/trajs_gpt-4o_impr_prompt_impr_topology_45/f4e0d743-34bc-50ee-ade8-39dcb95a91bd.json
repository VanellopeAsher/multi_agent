Let's break down her expenses:\n\n1. **Food**:  \n   - Cost per week: $25  \n   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost of food is $25 × 4 = $100.  \n   - Thus, the annual cost of food is $100 × 12 = $1,200.  \n\n2. **Treats**:  \n   - Cost per month: $20  \n   - Thus, the annual cost of treats is $20 × 12 = $240.  \n\n3. **Medicine**:  \n   - Cost per month: $100  \n   - Thus, the annual cost of medicine is $100 × 12 = $1,200.  \n\n4. **Shampoo**:  \n   - Cost per month: $15  \n   - Thus, the annual cost of shampoo is $15 × 12 = $180.  \n\n5. **Toy**:  \n   - Cost every two months: $10  \n   - In a year, Madeline will buy toys for 12 months ÷ 2 = 6 times.  \n   - Thus, the annual cost of toys is $10 × 6 = $60.  \n\nNow, adding all these expenses gives us the total annual cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Annual Cost} = \\text{Food} + \\text{Treats} + \\text{Medicine} + \\text{Shampoo} + \\text{Toy}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Annual Cost} = \\$1,200 + \\$240 + \\$1,200 + \\$180 + \\$60\n\\]\n\nCalculating further:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Annual Cost} = \\$2,880\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Madeline spends $2,880 per year on her dog. \n\nNow, let's engage in a discussion on this approach."
