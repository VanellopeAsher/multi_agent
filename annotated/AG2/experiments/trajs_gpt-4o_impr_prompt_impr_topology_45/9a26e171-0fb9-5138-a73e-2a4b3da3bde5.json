The one-fourth that do not have a desktop includes those without either device:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4}T = 60\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving For Total Students \\( T \\):**\n   - From the equation above:\n     \\[\n     T = 4 \\times 60 = 240\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, there are 240 students in that grade level.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are 240 students at that grade level.\n\nThis procedure outlines how to use the given relationships and conditions to determine the total number of students. Let's discuss any alternative strategies or verify the logic with the team."

Given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this number represents one-third of the students who neither have a desktop nor a laptop, we find that the full group of students without either is 60 students.\n\n2. The problem statement tells us that three-fourths of the total students have a desktop computer. Hence, one-fourth do not have a desktop, equivalent to the 60 students identified above.\n\n3. Therefore, the equation for the total number of students \\( T \\) based on the one-fourth who do not have a desktop is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}T = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. Solving for \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   T = 4 \\times 60 = 240\n   \\]\n\nGiven the consistent result from different approaches, the solution to the problem is confirmed.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{240}**"
