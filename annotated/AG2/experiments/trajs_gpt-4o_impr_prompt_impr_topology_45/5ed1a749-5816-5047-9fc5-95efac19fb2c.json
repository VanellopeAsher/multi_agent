Let's assume the number of pieces in the first lego boxed set is \\( x \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, the second lego boxed set has 3 times more pieces than the first one. Therefore, it has \\( 3x \\) pieces.\n\n3. The third lego boxed set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one. Therefore, it has \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\) pieces.\n\n4. To find the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up, we sum up all the pieces from the three sets:\n\n   \\[\n   Total\\_pieces = x + 3x + \\frac{x}{4}\n   \\]\n\n5. To simplify the expression, we can combine the terms:\n\n   \\[\n   Total\\_pieces = x + 3x + \\frac{x}{4} = 4x + \\frac{x}{4}\n   \\]\n\n6. To add these terms, we express them with a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 1 is 4:\n\n   \\[\n   Total\\_pieces = \\frac{4x \\times 4}{4} + \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{16x}{4} + \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{16x + x}{4} = \\frac{17x}{4}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of lego blocks Johnny picks up is \\(\\frac{17x}{4}\\). However, for a concrete answer, we need the exact number of pieces in the first set (\\(x\\)). If \\(x\\) is provided, you can directly calculate by plugging it into the formula."
