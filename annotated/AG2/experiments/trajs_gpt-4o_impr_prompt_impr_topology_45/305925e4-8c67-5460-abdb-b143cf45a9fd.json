After scoring an additional 10 points, her new score becomes:\n   \\[\n   225 + 10 = 235 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find Joey's score:**\n   Joey's score after his turn is not explicitly provided. We need to use the details given to solve this. Let's denote Joey's score gained in his turn as \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Joey's new score:**\n   Joey's original score is 214 points. After his turn, his score will be:\n   \\[\n   214 + x \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the difference between Joey’s score and Marcy’s score:**\n   Joey is winning, so:\n   \\[\n   (214 + x) - 235 = \\text{amount Joey is winning by}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   214 + x - 235 = -21 + x\n   \\]\n   Joey is then winning by \\((x - 21)\\) points.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need the specific value of \\( x \\) (the points Joey scored in his turn). Since the question asks for how many points Joey is winning by, you will need that score. However, based solely on the information provided, we cannot determine Joey's winning margin without knowing the exact points he scores in his turn. The margin Joey is winning by is \\( x - 21\\), where \\( x \\) is yet to be determined."

Since that information isn't provided in the problem, we can express the solution in terms of the variable representing Joey's additional score. \n\nI'll write a piece of Python code that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\n# Let's define the variables\ninitial_joey_points = 214\njoey_points_scored = None  # This should be provided or assumed in a real scenario\nmarcy_initial_points = 225\nmarcy_additional_points = 10\n\n# Calculate Marcy's total score after her turn\nmarcy_total_points = marcy_initial_points + marcy_additional_points\n\n# Allow input for Joey's scored points to compute his total and find the lead\n# Here the lead Joey has is expressed generally due to lack of specific 'joey_points_scored'\njoey_lead = lambda js: initial_joey_points + js - marcy_total_points \n\n# Note: Without 'joey_points_scored', we represent the solution as a function.\nprint(f\"For Joey to be winning, given 'js' as points Joey scored, he has (js - 21) points lead.\")\n```\n\nThis code gives you flexibility to input Joey's scored points to know by how many points he is winning. If you do have or find out the value for Joey's scored points, substitute `joey_points_scored` with that value to obtain a numerical result.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Both agents agree on the expression for the points by which Joey is winning.\n\n### Final Analysis:\n1. **From Agent Problem Solver**: The expression for Joey winning is captured as \\( x - 21 \\) where \\( x \\) represents the points scored by Joey during his turn.\n2. **From Agent Code Executor**: This logic is affirmed in the code, where the lead Joey has over Marcy's score is put in the form of a function calculating \\( x - 21 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWithout knowing the specific number of points Joey scored, we express Joey's lead in terms of \\( x \\). Therefore, Joey is winning by \\( (x - 21) \\) points, given by his score on his turn.\n\nAs requested, without an explicit numerical value for \\( x \\), we represent the solution in its algebraic form:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'x - 21'}**"
