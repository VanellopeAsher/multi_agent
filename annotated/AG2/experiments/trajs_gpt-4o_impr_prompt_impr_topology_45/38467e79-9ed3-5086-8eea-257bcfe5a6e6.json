Let's walk through the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Fraction**: We know that two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home. This implies that the one-third of students do not have a desktop computer at home.\n\n2. **Relation with the 30 Students**: From the problem, 30 students do not have desktop computers. Since one-third of the students do not have desktop computers, we can establish that:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Total Students} = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the Total Number of Students**:\n\n   - Use the equation from the previous step:\n   \n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Total Students} = 30\n     \\]\n\n   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for the total number of students:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 30 \\times 3 = 90\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: There are a total of 90 students at that grade level.\n\nIn summary, when two-thirds of the students have desktop computers and 30 students do not, it means that the total number of students in that grade level is 90."
