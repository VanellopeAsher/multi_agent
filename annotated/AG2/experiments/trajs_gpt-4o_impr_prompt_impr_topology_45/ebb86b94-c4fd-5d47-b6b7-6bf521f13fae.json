Thus, Reggie ran:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Lynn's miles**: Unfortunately, there's no further direct information given about how many miles Lynn ran.

As it stands, the information provided does not include data on Lynn's running distance.\n\nWithout additional context or information, it's impossible to specify precisely how many miles Lynn ran.
