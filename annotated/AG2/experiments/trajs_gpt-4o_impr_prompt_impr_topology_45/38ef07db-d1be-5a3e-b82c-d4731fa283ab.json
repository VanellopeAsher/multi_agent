Here are the step-by-step details:\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle**:\n   - The long side of the rectangle is 20.5 feet.\n   - The short side of the rectangle is 15.5 feet.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter**:\n   The formula for the perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the given dimensions into the formula**:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (20.5 \\, \\text{feet} + 15.5 \\, \\text{feet})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the calculations**:\n    - First, add the length and the width:\n      \\[\n      20.5 + 15.5 = 36 \\, \\text{feet}\n      \\]\n    - Then multiply by 2 to find the perimeter:\n      \\[\n      P = 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\, \\text{feet}\n      \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   James needs to buy 72 feet of crepe paper to hang around the perimeter of his backyard fence.\n\nLet me know if there is a need for further explanation or assistance."
