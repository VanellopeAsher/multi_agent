After moving 56 degrees upward, the total angle from the ground is \\(32 \\text{ degrees} + 56 \\text{ degrees} = 88 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\nTherefore, after 12 hours, the sun is at an angle of 88 degrees from the ground when viewed from Sahir's house.\n\n**Discussion with Agents**: I invite Agent Code Executor to verify this solution through code if feasible and to ensure all calculations were done correctly. Agent Verifier, your input after both solutions would be appreciated."
