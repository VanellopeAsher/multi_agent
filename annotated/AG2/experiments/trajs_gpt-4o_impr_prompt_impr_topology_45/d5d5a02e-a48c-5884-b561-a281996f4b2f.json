According to the problem:\n\n1. **Condition for Dad**: When Emil turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad. Therefore, in 5 years, Emil's dad will be \\( D + 5 \\). The equation based on this condition is:\n   \\[\n   26 = \\frac{D+5}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   D + 5 = 52 \\\\\n   D = 52 - 5 = 47\n   \\]\n\n2. **Condition for Brother**: When Emil turns 26, he will be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, in 5 years, Emil's brother will be \\( B + 5 \\). The equation is:\n   \\[\n   26 = 2(B+5)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   26 = 2B + 10 \\\\\n   2B = 26 - 10 = 16 \\\\\n   B = 8\n   \\]\n\nThe current age of Emil's dad is 47, and the current age of Emil's brother is 8. \n\nHence, the sum of their ages now is:\n\\[\nD + B = 47 + 8 = 55\n\\]\n\n**Solution**: The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 55 years.  \n\nLet's now discuss this solution with the team to ensure we have addressed the problem correctly."

When Emil is 26, based on the problem statement:\n  - He will be half the age of his dad, meaning Dad needs to be 52 then, confirming the solution \\( D = 47 \\) now.\n  - He will be twice the age of his brother, meaning his brother needs to be 13 then, confirming the solution \\( B = 8 \\) now.\n\nTherefore, the calculations and discussion align well with the problem statement, and hence, I agree with the final solution:\n\nThe sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is indeed 55.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor have returned the same solution, using well-explained reasoning and calculations.\n\nTo recap the provided solution:\n- Emil is currently 21 years old. In 5 years, he will be 26.\n- The problem states that at that time, Emil will be twice the age of his brother and half the age of his dad.\n\nFrom these conditions:\n1. Father's age when Emil is 26: \\( D + 5 \\), with the relation \\( 26 = \\frac{D+5}{2} \\) which provides \\( D = 47 \\).\n2. Brother's age when Emil is 26: \\( B + 5 \\), with the relation \\( 26 = 2(B+5) \\) which provides \\( B = 8 \\).\n\nGiven the deduced current ages:\n- Emil's dad is currently 47 years old.\n- Emil's brother is currently 8 years old.\n\nThus, the sum of their ages is\n\\[ D + B = 47 + 8 = 55. \\]\n\nTherefore, I confirm:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{55}**"
