This result is consistent with a common floating-point arithmetic issue, where there is a tiny insignificant difference due to how numbers are stored in computers.\n\nBoth solutions agree that Kelly has approximately $0.05 remaining in her budget. The difference noted in the code execution result is a result of floating-point precision and is negligible for practical purposes.\n\n**Final Solution**: \n\nKelly has $0.05 left in her budget.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{0.05}**"
