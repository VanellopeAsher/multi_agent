However, the problem as it stands does not provide the shark's body length, which is crucial information.\n\nHere's how we would solve it if we were given the shark's body length:\n\n1. **Identify the Length of the Remoras**: Each remora is 6 inches long and there are 2 remoras, so the total length contributed by the remoras is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Length of Remoras} = 2 \\times 6 \\text{ inches} = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Shark's Body Length**: Let's assume the shark's length is \\( S \\) inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n    - The percentage of the shark's body length that is composed of the remoras is given by:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Length of Remoras}}{S} \\right) \\times 100\n    \\]\n\nWithout the shark's length, the problem cannot be solved accurately.
