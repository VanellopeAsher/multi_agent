Since 1 dozen equals 12, this means she made:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ brownies}\n     \\]\n   \n   - At her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 dozen brownies, which is equal to:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ brownies}\n     \\]\n   \n   - At her surprise home party, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. This is equal to:\n     \\[\n     48 \\text{ brownies} \\quad (4 \\times 12)\n     \\]\n\n   Add all these brownies together to find the total Greta had:\n   \\[\n   12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \\text{ brownies}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Brownies Eaten at the Party**:\n\n   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. This amount is equal to:\n     \\[\n     18 \\text{ brownies} \\quad (1.5 \\times 12)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Leftover Brownies**:\n\n   Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:\n   \\[\n   66 - 18 = 48 \\text{ brownies}\n   \\]\n\nSo, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over at the end of the day. \n\nLet's proceed with the discussion and verification."
