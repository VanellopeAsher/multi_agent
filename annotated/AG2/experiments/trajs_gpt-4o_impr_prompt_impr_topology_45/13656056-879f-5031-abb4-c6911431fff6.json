Assuming he works 7 days a week, we can multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he worked.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Daily Earnings} \\times \\text{Number of Days}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 300 \\times 7 = 2100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Expenses**: We know from the problem statement that Gerald spent a total of $1000 during this week.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Money**: Subtract the expenses from the total earnings to determine how much Gerald has left.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Left} = \\text{Total Earnings} - \\text{Expenses}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Left} = 2100 - 1000 = 1100\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after spending $1000, Gerald has $1100 left from his weekly earnings. \n\nI'll discuss my findings with the team to see if everyone agrees with this solution."
