Hence, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n3. **Seashells Brought by the Boys**: Each boy brought back 60 seashells.\n    - Total seashells brought by all boys = 10 boys * 60 seashells/boy = 600 seashells.\n4. **Seashells Brought by the Girls**: The girls brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys.\n    - Number of seashells identical to those brought by boys = 600 seashells. \n    - Additional shells, which is 4.5 times the number of shells that the boys collected = 4.5 * 600 seashells.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Seashells Brought by the Girls**:\n    - Total seashells brought by the girls = 600 + (4.5 * 600)\n    - Total seashells brought by the girls = 600 + 2700 = 3300 seashells.\n\n6. **Seashells Brought by Each Girl**: There are 10 girls.\n    - Seashells brought by each girl = Total seashells brought by the girls / Number of girls\n    - Seashells brought by each girl = 3300 seashells / 10 girls = 330 seashells.\n\nThus, each girl brought back 330 seashells."
