Each pack contains 100 balloons.  \n   So, the total number of balloons is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Balloons} = 10 \\times 100 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Balloons Remaining:**  \n   At the end of the afternoon, 120 balloons are left.  \n\n3. **Calculate Balloons Used:**  \n   The number of balloons thrown is the difference between the total number of balloons and the number remaining:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Thrown} = \\text{Total Balloons} - \\text{Balloons Remaining} = 1000 - 120 = 880\n   \\]\n\nThus, Jolene and her friends threw 880 balloons."
