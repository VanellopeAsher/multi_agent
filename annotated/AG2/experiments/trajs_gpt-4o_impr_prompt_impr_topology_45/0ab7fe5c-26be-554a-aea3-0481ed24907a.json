We need to determine the total number of each type of tulip.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Rows for Each Type of Tulip**:\n   - Given that he can fit 6 red tulips in a row, calculate the number of rows of red tulips.\n   - Given that he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, calculate the number of rows of blue tulips.\n\n3. **Find the Total Number of Rows**:\n   - Since these rows are independent, we can simply add the number of rows for each type of tulip to get the total number of rows of flowers.\n\nLet's go through these calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Number of Tulips**:\n   - Red tulips: \\(3.6 \\times 10 = 36\\) red tulips.\n   - Blue tulips: \\(2.4 \\times 10 = 24\\) blue tulips.\n\n2. **Number of Rows for Each Type of Tulip**:\n   - For red tulips:\n     - Number of rows = Total red tulips / Tulips per row = \\(36 / 6 = 6\\) rows.\n   - For blue tulips:\n     - Number of rows = Total blue tulips / Tulips per row = \\(24 / 8 = 3\\) rows.\n\n3. **Total Number of Rows**:\n   - Total number of rows = Number of rows of red tulips + Number of rows of blue tulips = \\(6 + 3 = 9\\) rows.\n\nThus, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers."
