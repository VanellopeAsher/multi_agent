Knowing her total:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ (tallest)} + x \\text{ (shortest)} = 105\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 105 - 60 = 45 \\text{ apples}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Comparing the Shortest Trees Apple Gathering:**\n   - Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees.\n   - Her sister gathered 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n   - Therefore, her sister gathered:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{45 \\text{ (sister)}}{15 \\text{ (Joanne)}} = 3 \\text{ times as many apples}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Joanne's sister gathered 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees."
