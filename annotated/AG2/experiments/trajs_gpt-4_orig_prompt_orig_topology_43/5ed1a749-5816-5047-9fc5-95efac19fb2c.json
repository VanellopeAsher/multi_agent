You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Let's break down the problem first.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Johnny dumped three lego box sets on the floor. \nLet's assume that the number of pieces in the first lego box set is `x`.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- The second lego box set contains `3 * x` pieces, which is `3` times the number of pieces in the first set.\n- The third lego box set contains `x / 4` pieces, which is 1/4 the number of pieces in the first set.\n\nSo, the total number of pieces Johnny needs to pick up is `x + 3 * x + x / 4`.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give the specific value of `x`.
