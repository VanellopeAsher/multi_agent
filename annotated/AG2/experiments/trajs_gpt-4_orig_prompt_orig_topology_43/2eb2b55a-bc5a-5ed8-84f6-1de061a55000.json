You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

After that, we can calculate the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day by adding the remaining bandages at the end of the third day to the total bandages used and then subtracting total bandages procured.\n\nLet's follow these steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bandages used. On the first day, the medical staff used 38 bandages. On the second day, they used 10 bandages less than the previous day, so they used 28 bandages. On the third day, they used half a pack of bandages, or 25 bandages. So, the total number of bandages used is 38 (day 1) + 28 (day 2) + 25 (day 3).\n\n2. Calculate the total number of bandages procured. On the first day, the medical staff procured one large pack of bandages, or 50 bandages. On the third day, they procured two large packs of bandages, or 100 bandages. So, the total number of bandages procured is 50 (day 1) + 100 (day 3).\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the total number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day by adding the remaining bandages at the end of the third day (78 bandages) to the total number of bandages used and then subtracting the total number of bandages procured. \n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations."
