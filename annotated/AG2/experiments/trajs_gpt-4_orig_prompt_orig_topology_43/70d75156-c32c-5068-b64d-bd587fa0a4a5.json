Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Finally, we multiply the number of boxes sold by the number of oranges in a box to get the number of oranges she sold.\n\nLet's assume that Mrs. Harrington initially bought 'x' boxes.\n\nGiven:\nShe gave 2 boxes of oranges each to her mom and sister, i.e. she gave away 2*2=4 boxes.\nShe kept 1/4 of the boxes and sold the rest, so she sold 1-1/4=3/4 of the boxes.\n\nSo the equations we get from the problem are:\n1. x = number of boxes given to mom and sister + number of boxes she kept + number of boxes she sold.\n2. number of oranges sold = number of boxes sold * number of oranges per box.\n\nCase 3: We'll need to solve the equations using Python.\n\nStep 1: Solve the equation to find 'x'.\nStep 2: Use the value of 'x' to find the number of boxes sold.\nStep 3: Find the number of oranges sold."

So, our calculations will not result in a specific numerical amount, but an expression in terms of 'x'.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\nx = symbols('x')  # total number of boxes\n\n# Calculate the number of boxes remaining after Mrs. Harrington gave 4 boxes away\nremaining_boxes = x - 4\n\n# Calculate the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington sold\nboxes_sold = remaining_boxes - (1/4)*remaining_boxes\n\n# Each box contains 20 oranges, so calculate the total number of oranges sold\noranges_sold = boxes_sold*20\n\nprint('Number of oranges sold:', oranges_sold)\n```\n\nIn this symbolic expression, substitute different positive integer values for 'x' (like 5, 6, 7, etc.) until you get an integer value for the number of oranges sold.
