  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that, therefore 3 hours, swimming (totaling 9 hours).\n2. He watched 3 different shows for 2 hours each (3*2 = 6 hours).  \n\nTherefore, the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 15 hours. \n\nAccording to the problem, this 15 hours is 30% of his total time which means T = 15 hours / 0.30.\n\nGiven that he spent 40% of that total time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying T with 0.40. \n\nLet's calculate these in Python."
