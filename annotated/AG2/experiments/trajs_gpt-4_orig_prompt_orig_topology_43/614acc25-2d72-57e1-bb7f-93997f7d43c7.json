The problem provides us with two equations:\n1. \"Last night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars.\" This gives us the equation: w1 = 10.\n2. \"Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.\" This gives us two equations: w2 = 3c2, c2 = c1 - 3.\n\nFrom these, we can derive an equation system to solve for the number of each animal Rick killed each night.

We also know that the number of cougars on the second night was three less than the first night, so c2 = c1 - 3.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake when we set the number of wolves on the second night equal to the number of wolves on the first night. w1 is not equal to w2. \n\nInstead, let's assume c1 to be the number of cougars killed on the first night. Then, c2 will be c1 - 3.

He killed \"some\" cougars yesterday. In English, \"some\" often implies more than a couple but not a lot.\n2.
