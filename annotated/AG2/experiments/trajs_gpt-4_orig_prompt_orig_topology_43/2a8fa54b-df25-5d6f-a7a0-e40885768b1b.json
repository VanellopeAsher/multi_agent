You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

Knowing that, if the mean of all the quizzes scores is 70, we can use the formula of the mean to calculate the sum of all the scores. After that, we subtract the sum of the known scores from the sum of all scores to find the forgotten score.\n\nWe can solve this problem with python code directly:\n\n```python\n# Known scores\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# Sum of known scores\nknown_sum = sum(scores)\n\n# Total number of scores\ntotal_scores = len(scores) + 1  # +1 for the forgotten score\n\n# Average score\nmean = 70\n\n# sum of all scores \n# mean = sum_of_all_scores / total_scores \nsum_of_all_scores = mean * total_scores \n\n# The forgotten score is the total sum minus the known sum.\nforgotten_score = sum_of_all_scores - known_sum\n\nprint(forgotten_score)\n```"
