Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Let's find out:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variables\narticles_monday = 5\nmultiplier_tuesday = 1 + Rational(2,5)\n\n# calculate the number of articles on Tuesday\narticles_tuesday = articles_monday * multiplier_tuesday\nprint(articles_tuesday)\n```\n\nThen, let's calculate the total hours spent on Monday and Tuesday:\n\n```python\n# define the time spent per article\nhours_per_article = 4\n\n# calculate the total hours for Monday and Tuesday\ntotal_hours_monday = hours_per_article * articles_monday\ntotal_hours_tuesday = hours_per_article * articles_tuesday\ntotal_hours_monday_tuesday = total_hours_monday + total_hours_tuesday\nprint(total_hours_monday_tuesday)\n```\n\nAfter, let's calculate the number of hours Meredith spent writing on Wednesday:\n\n```python\n# define the total hours\ntotal_hours = 104\n\n# calculate the hours on Wednesday\nhours_wednesday = total_hours - total_hours_monday_tuesday\nprint(hours_wednesday)\n```\n\nNext, we'll find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday:\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of articles on Wednesday\narticles_wednesday = hours_wednesday / hours_per_article\nprint(articles_wednesday)\n```\n\nLastly, let's find out how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday:\n\n```python\ntimes_as_many = articles_wednesday / articles_tuesday\nprint(times_as_many)\n```"
