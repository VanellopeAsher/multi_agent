  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.
