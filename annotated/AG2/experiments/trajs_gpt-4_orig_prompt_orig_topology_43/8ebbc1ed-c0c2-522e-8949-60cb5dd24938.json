  "problem": "A math teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk to write equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher is environmentally conscious and tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. However, on Monday, the teacher had to conduct an extra class for his students who needed additional help. As a result, he ended up using 45% of the chalk, which was 1.5 times more than his usual consumption. He also noticed that the chalk weighed 0.5 ounces, but this didn't affect his usage. Given that the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches and he plans to return to his usual 20% usage per day, how many days does he have before he needs to recycle this piece of chalk?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.
