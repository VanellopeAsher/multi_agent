You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

Let's denote the number of Becca's cards as `b`, the number of Smendrick's cards as `s`, and the number of PJ's cards as `p`.\n2. According to the problem, we have the following equations:\n- b = s + 15 (Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick)\n- s = 4p  (Smendrick has 4 times the cards that PJ has)\n- b + s + p = 447 (The total number of cards is 447)\n\nWe can solve this system step by step:\n1. Substitute s into the first equation: b = 4p + 15\n2. Substitute b and s (equal to 4p) into the total equation: 4p + 15 + 4p + p = 447\n\nLet's solve these equations in Python."
