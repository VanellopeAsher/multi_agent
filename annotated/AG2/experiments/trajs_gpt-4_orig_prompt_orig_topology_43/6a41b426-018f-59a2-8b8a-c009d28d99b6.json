You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Assume that John runs x miles on the higher distance day, then he runs 0.5x miles on each of the other two days.\n2. Given that John runs 60 miles a week, we can create an equation:\n\n    x + 2*0.5x = 60\n\nWe can solve this equation which will give us the distance John runs on the higher distance day, and then we can find the distance he runs on other two days by taking half of the distance of the higher distance day.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\neq = Eq(x + 2*0.5*x, 60)\nx_val = solve(eq, x)[0]\n\n# To get the distance he runs on other two days\nhalf_x_val = 0.5 * x_val \n\nprint('John runs', x_val, 'miles on the higher distance day.')\nprint('He runs', half_x_val, 'miles each on the other two days.')\n```"
