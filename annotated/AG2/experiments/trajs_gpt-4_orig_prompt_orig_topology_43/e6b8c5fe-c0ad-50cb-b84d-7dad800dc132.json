You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nColby wants to buy some gumballs.

After that, if each gumball is 5 pennies, we can then divide the total amount in pennies by 5 to get the total number of gumballs Colby can buy.\n\nAccording to the United States coinage system:\n* A quarter is worth 25 pennies\n* A dime is worth 10 pennies\n* A nickel is worth 5 pennies\n* A penny is 1 penny\n\nYou can solve the problem using Python code as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the value of each type of coin in pennies\nquarter_value = 25\ndime_value = 10\nnickel_value = 5\npenny_value = 1\n\n# define the amount of each type of coin that Colby has\nquarters = 8\ndimes = 6\nnickels = 14\npennies = 15\n\n# calculate the total value of each type of coin that Colby has\ntotal_quarters = quarter_value * quarters\ntotal_dimes = dime_value * dimes\ntotal_nickels = nickel_value * nickels\ntotal_pennies = penny_value * pennies\n\n# calculate the total amount of money that Colby has\ntotal_money = total_quarters + total_dimes + total_nickels + total_pennies\n\n# define the cost of a gumball in pennies\ngumball_cost = 5\n\n# calculate the total number of gumballs that Colby can buy\ntotal_gumballs = total_money // gumball_cost\n\nprint(total_gumballs)\n```"
