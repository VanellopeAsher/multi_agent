You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of 10. We can calculate their individual age and then multiply by 3 for the total age of the sisters.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# Calculate the age of the sisters\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10\ntotal_sister_age = 3 * sister_age\nprint(total_sister_age)\n```\n\n2. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, and the other brother's age is twice than this. We first calculate the age of the younger brother, then use it to find the older brother's age, and then total the brothers' age.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the age of the brothers\nyoung_brother_age = 3/5 * 20\nold_brother_age = 2 * young_brother_age\ntotal_brother_age = young_brother_age + old_brother_age\nprint(total_brother_age)\n```\n\n3. Finally, we add the total age of sisters and brothers to get the answer.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total age\ntotal_age = total_sister_age + total_brother_age\nprint(total_age)\n```"
