  "problem": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.

      "content": "The key to this problem is to first figure out how many apples Joanne gathered in total and how many her sister gathered. We can then figure out how many apples the sister gathered from the shortest trees and compare it to how many Joanne gathered from the shortest trees.\n\nFrom the text, we know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, half that amount from the shortest trees and 350 apples from the average trees. We can calculate the total amount Joanne gathered:\n\n```python\njoanne_tallest = 30\njoanne_shortest = joanne_tallest / 2\njoanne_average = 350\njoanne_total = joanne_tallest + joanne_shortest + joanne_average\nprint(joanne_total)\n```\n\nCompared to Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. We can calculate the total amount the sister gathered:\n\n```python\nsister_tallest = joanne_tallest * 2\ntotal_apples = 500\nsister_total = total_apples - joanne_total\nprint(sister_total)\n```\n\nThen, we can calculate how many apples the sister gathered from the shortest trees:\n\n```python\nsister_shortest = sister_total - sister_tallest\nprint(sister_shortest)\n```\n\nFinally, we can calculate how many times the sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees by dividing how many apples the sister gathered from the shortest trees by how many apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees:\n\n```python\nshortest_ratio = sister_shortest / joanne_shortest\nprint(shortest_ratio)\n```"
