You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSam ran 3.5 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5.5 miles.  How many miles did Sam run this week?"

So the total miles Sam ran this week can be calculated by adding up these miles.\n\n```python\n# Python code\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\nmiles_3_days = 3 * 3.5\n\n# miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday\nmiles_2_days = 2 * 5.5\n\n# total miles Sam ran this week\ntotal_miles = miles_3_days + miles_2_days\n\nprint(total_miles)\n```\n\nThen, you will get the total miles Sam ran this week which is the answer to this problem."
