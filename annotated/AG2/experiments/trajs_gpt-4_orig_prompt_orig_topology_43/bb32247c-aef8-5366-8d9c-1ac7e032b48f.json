We can represent the initial height as 'h' (in inches), and then express the height after 3 weeks in terms of 'h'. \n\nHere are the steps we can follow:\n\n1. After the first week, the beanstalk's height is 'h' inches (Given).\n2. After the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height, so it's now '2h' inches tall.\n3. In the third week, it grew by another 4 inches. So, the final height of the beanstalk after the third week can be expressed as '2h + 4' inches. \n\nThis is as far as we can go without knowing the actual initial height 'h'. \n\nIf we are allowed to make queries in Python, we can build a python function where we can replace h with any given initial height to get the final height after the third week. \n\n```python\ndef calculate_height(h):\n    return 2*h + 4\n\nprint(calculate_height(h)) # replace h with the actual initial height \n```"

If we want to test the function with an initial height of, say, 3 inches, the corrected code would look like:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_height(h):\n    return 2*h + 4\n\nprint(calculate_height(3)) # replace 3 with the actual initial height\n```\n\nIn this code, 'h' is replaced with '3', indicating that the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week is 3 inches. When you run this code, it will output the height of the beanstalk after three weeks given that the initial height was 3 inches. \n\nYou should replace '3' with the actual initial height if you have that information."

The output is 10 which means the beanstalk is 10 inches tall after 3 weeks, assuming that the initial height was 3 inches. \n\nThis result is based on the conditions stipulated in the problem: namely, that the beanstalk's height doubles in the second week and grows by an additional 4 inches in the third week. So, the beanstalk's height, if the initial height is `h`, can always be represented by `2h + 4`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is: \nIf the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week is `h` inches, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks will be `2h + 4` inches. \n\nIf `h = 3` inches then the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is \\boxed{10} inches."
