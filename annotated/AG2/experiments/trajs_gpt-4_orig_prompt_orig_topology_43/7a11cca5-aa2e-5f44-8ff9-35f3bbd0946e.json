You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

Calculate the amount of water that passes through the river on the first two days (4000 gallons on the first day, and double that on the second, therefore 4000 + 4000*2).\n2. Subtract this total from the total amount of water that passes through the river over the three days (14000 gallons).\n3. The difference is the amount that passes through on the third day.\n\nWe can go ahead and code this:\n\n```python\n# Calculation\n\ninitial_day = 4000\nsecond_day = 2 * initial_day\ntotal = 14000\n\nthird_day = total - (initial_day + second_day)\n\nprint(third_day)\n```\n\nThis Python script will give us the increase amount in the third day."
