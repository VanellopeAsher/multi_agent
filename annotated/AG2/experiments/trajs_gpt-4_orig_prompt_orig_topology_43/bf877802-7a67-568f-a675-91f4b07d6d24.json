You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

We multiply the number of hours the sun was moving at each speed with that speed in degrees per hour. We then add this total to the initial 32 degree angle to find the final angle between the ground and the sun.\n\nThe Python code will be like this:\n\n```python\n# Given values\ninitial_angle = 32\nfirst_speed = 5\nfirst_duration = 10\nsecond_speed = 3\nsecond_duration = 2\n\n# Calculate total degrees moved\ntotal_move = first_speed * first_duration + second_speed * second_duration\n\n# Calculate final angle\nfinal_angle = initial_angle + total_move\n\nprint(final_angle)\n```\nThis code will result in the final angle from the ground to the sun after the described event."
