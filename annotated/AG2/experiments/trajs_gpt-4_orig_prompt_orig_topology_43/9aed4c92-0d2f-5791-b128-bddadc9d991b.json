You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark has $50.5 in his bank account.

This can be done by subtracting the money he currently has from the cost of the bike. After that, we divide the amount he needs to save by the amount he earns per day. This will give us the number of days it will take for Mark to save enough money.\n\nNow, let's solve this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# amount of money mark has\ncurrent_money = 50.5\n\n# cost of the bike\ncost_of_bike = 300.5\n\n# amount he earns per day\nearnings_per_day = 12.5\n\n# total money mark needs to save\ntotal_needed = cost_of_bike - current_money\n\n# days required to save enough money\ndays_required = total_needed / earnings_per_day\n\n# print the days required in the smallest possible non-fraction number\nprint(ceiling(days_required))\n```\n\nWe use the sympy.ceiling() function to round up the number of days to the next highest integer, because Mark cannot work a fraction of a day."
