You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJake is shopping at a clothing store.

Compute the total cost of t-shirts considering the buy one get one 50% off deal.\n2. Compute the price of the shoes after the discount.\n3. Add the total cost of t-shirts and the price of the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends at the store.\n\nThe Python code will be like this:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# define the original price of the T-shirt and the shoes\nprice_tshirt = 80\nprice_shoes = 400\n\n# calculate the total price of T-shirts\ntshirts_total_price = 0.5 * price_tshirt * sp.ceiling(20 / 2) + 0.5 * price_tshirt * sp.floor(20 / 2)\n\n# calculate the price of the shoes after the discount\nshoes_discount_price = price_shoes * (1 - 0.4)\n\n# calculate the total amount Jake spends at the store\ntotal_spend = sp.N(tshirts_total_price + shoes_discount_price)\n\nprint(total_spend)\n```\n\nAfter writing this code, you will get the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by running this code."
