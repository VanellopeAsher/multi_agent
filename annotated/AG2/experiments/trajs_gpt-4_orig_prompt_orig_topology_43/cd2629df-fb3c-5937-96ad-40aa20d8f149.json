You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

More specifically, on a month-by-month basis, which is cumulative and includes any increases of debt due to not paying off the full amount monthly. At the end of the 12th month he will pay the remaining amount, including the interest.\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps will be followed:\n1. Calculate the total amount paid in 11 months.\n2. Subtract this total from the initial amount borrowed to calculate the remaining debt.\n3. Add 2% interest to the remaining debt.\n4. Compute the amount Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month.\n\nThis kind of calculations can be directly solved with Python code. So, we'll implement these steps as Python code to find the solution."
