You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is to understand that the total length of ribbon that Monica has, 144 inches, needs to be divided equally among all the presents. \n\nGiven that she has 6 presents for her family, 4 for her buddies, and 2 for her educators, the total number of presents is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12. \n\nWe can solve this problem using python by dividing the total length of ribbon with the total number of presents.\n\nHere is the python program to get the solution:\n\n```python\n# total length of ribbon \ntotal_length = 144\n\n# total number of presents \ntotal_presents = 6 + 4 + 2\n\n# length of ribbon for each present's bow\nlength_per_present = total_length / total_presents\n\nprint(length_per_present)\n```\n\nAfter executing this program, it will give the length of ribbon that Monica can allocate for each present's bow."
