You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We then divide each of these pieces by 5 because each 1/4 piece is being divided into 5 equal parts. So the final length of each cut piece can be represented by \"ribbon_length / 20\".\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# the ribbon length is unknown at this moment, so let's represent it by a symbol\nribbon_length = symbols('ribbon_length')\n\n# calculate length of each final piece\nfinal_piece_length = ribbon_length / 20\n\nfinal_piece_length\n```\n\nPlease input the value of \"ribbon_length\" so we can calculate the final length of each piece."
