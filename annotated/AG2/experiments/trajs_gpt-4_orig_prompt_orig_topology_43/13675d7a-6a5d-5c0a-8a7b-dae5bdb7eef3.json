You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

After assembling all toys, there are still 276 wheels left in the box. So, we will calculate the total number of wheels before assembling as the sum of the wheels used and the wheels left.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of wheels Henry used which is 4 wheels per car times the number of cars plus 2 wheels per motorcycle times the number of motorcycles.\n\nThen we can calculate the total number of wheels in the box as the sum of the wheels Henry used and the wheels left after assembly.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variables\ncars = 57\nmotorcycles = 73\n\n# the number of wheels each car and motorcycle uses\nwheels_per_car = 4\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\n\n# the number of wheels left after assembly\nwheels_left = 276\n\n# calculate the total number of wheels used\nwheels_used = cars * wheels_per_car + motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle\n\n# calculate the total number of wheels in the box\ntotal_wheels = wheels_left + wheels_used\n\nprint(total_wheels)\n```"
