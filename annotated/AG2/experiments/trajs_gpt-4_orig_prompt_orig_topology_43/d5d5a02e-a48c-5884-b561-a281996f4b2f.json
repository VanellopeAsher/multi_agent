You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

Emil will be half the age of his dad when he turns 26. From this, we can write: 26 = 0.5 * (D + 5) -> (since his father is going to be 5 years older in 5 years).\n2. When Emil turns 26, his age will be twice than his brother. So we can write: 26 = 2 * (B + 5) -> (since his brother is also going to be 5 years older in 5 years). \n\nFrom these two equations, we can solve for D and B.\n\nAfter getting the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother, the sum of their ages (D+B) can be determined.\n\nLet's solve this with python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nD, B = symbols('D B')\n\n# setup equations\neq1 = Eq(26, 0.5 * (D + 5)) # equation for Emil's dad's future age\neq2 = Eq(26, 2 * (B + 5)) # equation for Emil's brother's future age\n\n# solve equations\nage_dad = solve(eq1, D)[0] # solve for Emil's dad's present age\nage_brother = solve(eq2, B)[0] # solve for Emil's brother's present age\n\n# find sum of their ages\nsum_ages = age_dad + age_brother\n\nprint(sum_ages)\n```"
