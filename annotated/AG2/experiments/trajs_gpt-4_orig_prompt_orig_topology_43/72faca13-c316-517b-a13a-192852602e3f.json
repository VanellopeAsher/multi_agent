You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents, how many cents will she have left?"

Calculate the total amount of money she initially has in cents.\n2. Subtract the cost of the can of pop and the candy bar in cents from the total amount of money she initially has.\n3. The remaining amount is the answer.\n\n```python\n# amount in quarters\nquarters_value = 5 * 25\n\n# amount in dimes\ndimes_value = 2 * 10\n\n# total amount\ntotal_value = quarters_value + dimes_value\n\n# cost of items\ncost_pop = 55\ncost_candy = 45\n\n# remaining amount\nremaining_value = total_value - cost_pop - cost_candy\n\nprint(remaining_value)\n```\nThis code calculates the initial total amount Kelly has in quarters and dimes, then deducts the cost of the pop and candy to get the remaining value. To get the amount in cents, each quarter is counted as 25 cents and each dime as 10 cents."
