Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Since the problem can be solved directly with Python code, we will use sympy to help us simplify fractions.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution using Python:\n\n1. Calculate the water depth on Tuesday by adding 7 feet which is more than the depth on Monday.\n2. Compute the water depth on Wednesday which is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday.\n3. Lastly, compute the tank’s water depth on Thursday, by adding half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday to the depth on Wednesday.\n\nLet's implement the steps in code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Initialize symbols\nM, T, W, Th = symbols('M T W Th')\n\n# Assign the depth on Monday\nM = 17\n# Calculate the depth on Tuesday\nT = M + 7\n# Calculate the depth on Wednesday\nW = T * 2 / 3\n# Calculate the depth on Thursday\nTh = W + (T - W) / 2\n\nprint(Th)\n```"
