You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

      "content": "The key idea to solve the problem is to find the total cost for both periods of time and then add these costs together. \n\nWe need to apply the following steps with Python:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for the first 10 years. It is $10 per visit, 3 times a year for 10 years.\n2. Calculate the cost of one visit which has increased by 150%. The new cost will be the initial cost plus 150% of the initial cost.\n3. Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years. It is the new cost per visit, 3 times a year for 3 years.\n4. Add the total cost for the first 10 years and the total cost for the next 3 years.\n\nLet's embed this solution in code:\n\n```python\n# Initial cost per visit\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10\n\n# Number of visits per year\nvisits_per_year = 3\n\n# Number of years for the first period\nyears_first_period = 10\n\n# Compute the total cost for the first period\ntotal_cost_first_period = initial_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_first_period\nprint(f\"The total cost for the first period is: {total_cost_first_period}\")\n\n# Compute the increased cost per visit\nincreased_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit + initial_cost_per_visit * 1.5\n\n# Number of years for the second period\nyears_second_period = 3\n\n# Compute the total cost for the second period\ntotal_cost_second_period = increased_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_second_period\nprint(f\"The total cost for the second period is: {total_cost_second_period}\")\n\n# Compute total cost for all visits\ntotal_cost = total_cost_first_period + total_cost_second_period\nprint(f\"The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is: {total_cost}\")\n\n```\nThe above program will give us the total money Pauline spent on all visits to the museum."
