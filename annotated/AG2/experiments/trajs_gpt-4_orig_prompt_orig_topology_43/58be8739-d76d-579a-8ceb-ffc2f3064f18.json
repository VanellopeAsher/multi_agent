You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

This problem involves simple arithmetic operations and can be solved by Python code directly.\n\nThe plan to solve the problem is as follows:\n1. Find the total time John spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows.\n2. Figure out that these activities occupy 30% of his total time.\n3. Calculate the total time he spent based on the 30% figure.\n4. Subtract the time he spent on boating, swimming, and shows from the total time to get the time he spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's translate this plan to Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# time for each activity\nboating = 6\nswimming = boating / 2\nshows = 3 * 2\n\n# calculate the total time spent for the mentioned activities\ntotal_time_activities = boating + swimming + shows\n\n# find the total time he spent.\n# the total time for activities is 30% of the total time spent.\ntotal_time = total_time_activities / 0.3\n\n# the time spent sightseeing is the total time minus the time spent on other activities\nsightseeing = total_time - total_time_activities\n\nprint(sightseeing)\n```"
