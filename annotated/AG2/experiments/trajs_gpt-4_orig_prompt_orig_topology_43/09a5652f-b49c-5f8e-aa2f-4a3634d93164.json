You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and a half as much the other two days he runs. He rests for 2 hours after each run. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "First, we calculate the total time John spends running each week. We know he runs for 3 hours the first day and half as much as that, which is 1.5 hours, for the next two days. Thus, the total time spent running each week is 3 + 1.5 * 2 = 6 hours. \n\nSince he runs 60 miles in these 6 hours, we can calculate his speed by dividing the distance by the time.  \n\nUsing the formula speed = distance/time, we write the python code as follows:\n\n```python\n# python code\ndistance_in_miles = 60\ntime_in_hours = 3 + 1.5 * 2\nspeed_in_mph = distance_in_miles / time_in_hours\nprint(speed_in_mph)\n```\n\nWe will input the code into a Python environment to run it and get the result."
