This gives us a total of 169 bandages.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- The nurses used 10 fewer bandages on the second day than on the first day.\n- They used half a pack (which equals to 25 bandages) on the third day.\n- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\nUsing this information, we can set up the following equation:\n\n- First_day_bandages + (First_day_bandages - 10) + 25 = 169 - 78\n\nWe will use Python's sympy package to solve this equation for the variable First_day_bandages."
