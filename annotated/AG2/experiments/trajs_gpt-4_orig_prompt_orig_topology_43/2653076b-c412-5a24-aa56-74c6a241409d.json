You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Compute the amount for each type of item by multiplying the price per item with the quantity.\n2. Add up these amounts to get the total amount before the discount.\n3. Apply the 10% discount on the total amount to compute the amount to be deducted.\n4. Subtract the discounted amount from the total amount to compute Marcus' total bill.\n\n# Python Code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# calculate the total cost for each type of item\ncroissants_cost = 5 * 3.50\ncinnamon_rolls_cost = 4 * 2.50\nmini_quiches_cost = 3 * 4.50\nblueberry_muffins_cost = 13 * 1.50\n\n# calculate the total cost before discount\ntotal_cost = croissants_cost + cinnamon_rolls_cost + mini_quiches_cost + blueberry_muffins_cost\n\n# calculate the discount\ndiscount = total_cost * 0.10\n\n# calculate the final cost (total cost - discount)\nfinal_cost = total_cost - discount\n\nprint(final_cost)\n```\n\nAbove Python code first calculates the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered, adds them up to find the total cost before any discounts. It then applies the 10% discount to this total cost to find the amount to be deducted. With this, it then reduces the total cost with the discounted amount to find out how much Marcus has to pay which provides the solution to this problem."
