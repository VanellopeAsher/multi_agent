You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

B + S + P = 341 (The total number of cards is 341)\n2. B = S + 12 (Becca has 0.12 hundred more cards than Smendrick)\n3.

We can use sympy to do this. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nB, S, P = symbols('B S P')\n\n# define the system of equations\neq1 = Eq(B + S + P, 341)\neq2 = Eq(B, S + 12)\neq3 = Eq(S, 3*P)\n\n# solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1,eq2,eq3), (B, S, P))\n\nprint(\"Becca has \", solution[B], \" cards.\")\n```\nAfter you run the code above, we will find out the number of cards Becca has."
