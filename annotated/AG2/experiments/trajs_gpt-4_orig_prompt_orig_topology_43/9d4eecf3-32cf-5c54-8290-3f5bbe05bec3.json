You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

The total is 6000 cherries, so Jerry should have 6000 - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)\n4. Finally, subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.\n\nWe can solve this problem using Python with sympy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variables\nR, J = symbols('R J')\n\n# given in problem\nR_value = 3000\ntotal_cherries = 6000\n\n# Richard has 1000 less cherries than Robert\nRi_value = R_value - 1000\n\n# Equations based on problem\neq1 = Eq(R + Ri_value + J, total_cherries)\n\n# Solve the equations\nJ_value = solve(eq1, J)[0]\n\n# Calculate difference \ndiff = R_value - J_value\nprint(diff)\n```"
