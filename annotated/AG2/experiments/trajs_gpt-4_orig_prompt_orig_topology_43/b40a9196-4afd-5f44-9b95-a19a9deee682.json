You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Finally, we'll apply the tax to the non-food items.\n\nLet's classify the items into food which include milk and eggs, and non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.\n\nThen we will calculate total cost by summing up costs of each group including taxes on non-food items.\n\nLet's solve this problem with Python."
