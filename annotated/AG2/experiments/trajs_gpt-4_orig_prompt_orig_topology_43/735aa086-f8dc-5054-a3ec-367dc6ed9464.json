  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

      "content": "The key idea of this problem is to firstly compute the total weight of all the feed and then divide it by the load capacity of the truck to get the number of trips needed.\n\nWe can solve this using Python.\n\nLet's define:\n- Hay weight as `hay_weight` = 750 * 420 (number of bales times the weight of each bale)\n- Oats weight as `oats_weight` = 650 * 200 (number of sacks times the weight of each sack)\n- Carrot weight as `carrot_weight` = 120 * 40 (number of bags times the weight of each bag)\n- Sugar cubes weight as `sugar_cubes_weight` = 10 * 20 (number of boxes times the weight of each box)\n\nSumming up these gives the total weight of the feed. Let's call it `total_weight`.\n\nThen, we compute the number of trips needed by the truck. It can be obtained by dividing the total weight by the truck's weight limit, taken as the ceiling because if there is a remaining fraction of weight that exceeds the truck's limit, then another trip is required. We can take care of this by using the `math.ceil` function from the math library in Python.\n\nNow let's write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sympy as sp\n\nhay_weight = 750 * 420\noats_weight = 650 * 200\ncarrot_weight = 120 * 40\nsugar_cubes_weight = 10 * 20\n\ntotal_weight = hay_weight + oats_weight + carrot_weight + sugar_cubes_weight\n\ntruck_weight_limit = 22500\n\ntrips_needed = math.ceil(total_weight / truck_weight_limit)\n\nprint(sp.Rational(total_weight, truck_weight_limit))\nprint(trips_needed)\n```\nThe `sp.Rational` function is used here to make sure we have the exact value of the division in fractional form."

The total weight of the feed divided by the truck weight limit is the exact fraction 20, which means no additional trips are needed because every trip is fully loaded with feed. Therefore, the farmer needs exactly 20 loads, or \\boxed{20} trips to transport all the feed to his farm."
