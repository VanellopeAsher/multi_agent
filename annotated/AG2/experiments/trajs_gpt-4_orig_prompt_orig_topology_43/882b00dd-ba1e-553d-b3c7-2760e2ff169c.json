  "problem": "When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour than brfore. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "First we'll calculate Billy's total rate per hour after a year, then calculate Sally's rate per hour after two months. \n\nBilly gets an initial rate of $10. He then receives a raise of $0.50 after two months, and an additional $1.00 on his first work anniversary, for a total rate of $10 + $0.5 + $1 = $11.5 per hour. \n\nSally starts at a rate of $10 + $0.5 = $10.5 per hour (since she starts at $0.5 more per hour than Billy's), and then receives a raise of $0.5 after two months, for a total rate of $10.5 + $0.5 = $11 per hour. \n\nAfter working 20 hours, we can calculate how much each of them will make, and then subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's. Let's do this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Billy's rate per hour\nbilly_rate = 10 + 0.5 + 1 \n\n# Billy's total earnings after working 20 hours\nbilly_earnings = billy_rate * 20   \n\n# Sally's rate per hour\nsally_rate = 10.5 + 0.5 \n\n# Sally's total earnings after working 20 hours\nsally_earnings = sally_rate * 20   \n\n# How much more Billy will earn than Sally\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings   \nprint(difference)   \n```\nLet's see what we get."
