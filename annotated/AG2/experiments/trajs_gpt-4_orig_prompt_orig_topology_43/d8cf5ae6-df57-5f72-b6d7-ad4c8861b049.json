  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is to calculate the total weight which the farmer bought and to divide by the number of trips. This should give us the weight carried per trip.\n\nFrom the text, we can extract:\n- The weight of the sugar cubes is 2*1 pounds.\n- The weight of the carrots is 4*12 pounds.\n- The weight of the hay is 42*75 pounds.\n- The weight of the oats is 20*65 pounds.\n\nWe will add these four numbers up and divide by 2 since the transportation is made in two trips.\n\nHere is a pythonic way of doing this:  \n\n```python\n# Calculate the weight of each type of feed\nsugar_cubes_weight = 2 * 1\ncarrots_weight = 4 * 12\nhay_weight = 42 * 75\noats_weight = 20 * 65\n\n# Calculate the total weight\ntotal_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight\n\n# Calculate the weight per trip\nweight_per_trip = total_weight / 2\n\n# Output the weight per trip\nprint(weight_per_trip)\n```"
