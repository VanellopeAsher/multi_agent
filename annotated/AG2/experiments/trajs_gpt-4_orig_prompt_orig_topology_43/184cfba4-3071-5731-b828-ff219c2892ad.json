You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

Moreover, we know Teresa's total earnings and the ratios of small to large stuffed animals sold. Using this information, we can set up an equation and solve it to find the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- S be the number of small stuffed animals sold,\n- L be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n\nUsing the ratios and the information we have:\n\n- L = S/2 (Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).\n- The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $40 (3 times the price of a small one).\n- Teresa's total earning is the sum of earnings from selling large and small stuffed animals.\n\nNow, we can set up the following equation:\n\nSmall stuffed animal sales + Large stuffed animal sales = Total sales\n40S + 3 * 40 * L = 1200\n\nSubstituting L = S/2 into the above equation, we can solve for S.\n\nLet's solve this using Python."
