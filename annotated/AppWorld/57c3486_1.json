This URL includes your client ID and specifies the permissions (scopes) your application needs.\n3. **Receive Authorization Code**: After the user authorizes your application, Spotify redirects them back to your specified redirect URI with an authorization code.\n4. **Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token**: Use the authorization code to request an access token from Spotify's Accounts service. This request includes your client ID, client secret, and the authorization code.\n5. **Use Access Token**: Once you have the access token, you can use it to authenticate API requests on behalf of the user.\nSince this process involves sensitive information and user interaction, it's typically done through a web application or a mobile app. If you need further assistance with this process, please let me know!"
