The `Player` class lacks functionality for handling encounters with monsters and treasure chests, which are essential for the game mechanics as described in the task.\n\n**Comment with Highest Priority:**\nThe `Player` class should include methods to handle interactions with monsters and treasure chests. Currently, the `combat` method only subtracts the monster's HP from the player's HP, but it does not account for the player's HP being reduced by the monster's attack. Additionally, there is no implementation for restoring HP when the player encounters a treasure chest.\n\n**Suggestions for Revision:**\n1. **Enhance the `combat` Method:**\n   - Modify the `combat` method to account for both the player's and the monster's attacks. For example, subtract the player's attack power from the monster's HP and vice versa.\n\n2. **Implement Treasure Chest Interaction:**\n   - Add a method in the `Player` class to handle interactions with treasure chests. This method should increase the player's HP by a random amount between 20 and 30.\n\n3. **Update the Game Loop:**\n   - Modify the game loop in `main.py` to check for player interactions with monsters and treasure chests based on the player's current position on the map.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the game will better align with the user's requirements and provide a more complete gameplay experience."

The `Player` class lacks functionality for handling encounters with monsters and treasure chests, which are essential for the game mechanics as described in the task.\n\n**Comment with Highest Priority:**\nThe `Player` class should include methods to handle interactions with monsters and treasure chests. Currently, the `combat` method only subtracts the monster's HP from the player's HP, but it does not account for the player's HP being reduced by the monster's attack. Additionally, there is no implementation for restoring HP when the player encounters a treasure chest.\n\n**Suggestions for Revision:**\n1. **Enhance the `combat` Method:**\n   - Modify the `combat` method to account for both the player's and the monster's attacks. For example, subtract the player's attack power from the monster's HP and vice versa.\n\n2. **Implement Treasure Chest Interaction:**\n   - Add a method in the `Player` class to handle interactions with treasure chests. This method should increase the player's HP by a random amount between 20 and 30.\n\n3. **Update the Game Loop:**\n   - Modify the game loop in `main.py` to check for player interactions with monsters and treasure chests based on the player's current position on the map.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the game will better align with the user's requirements and provide a more complete gameplay experience.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code.

However, there is a potential issue with the `ensure_valid_path` method in the `Map` class. The current implementation may lead to an infinite loop if the random wall placement consistently blocks the path between the start and the door. This is because the method keeps regenerating the entire map until a valid path is found, which might not be efficient or guaranteed to terminate in a reasonable time.\n\nTo fix this, consider implementing a more controlled wall placement strategy that ensures a valid path is maintained. One approach is to use a maze generation algorithm (like Prim's or Kruskal's) to create a path first and then add walls around it, ensuring that the path remains unblocked.\n\nHere's a suggestion for revision:\n\n1. Implement a maze generation algorithm to create a guaranteed path from the start to the door.\n2. Add additional walls randomly, ensuring they do not block the existing path.\n\nThis approach will ensure that the map generation is both efficient and guarantees a valid path without the risk of an infinite loop."

However, there is a potential issue with the `ensure_valid_path` method in the `Map` class. The current implementation may lead to an infinite loop if the random wall placement consistently blocks the path between the start and the door. This is because the method keeps regenerating the entire map until a valid path is found, which might not be efficient or guaranteed to terminate in a reasonable time.\n\nTo fix this, consider implementing a more controlled wall placement strategy that ensures a valid path is maintained. One approach is to use a maze generation algorithm (like Prim's or Kruskal's) to create a path first and then add walls around it, ensuring that the path remains unblocked.\n\nHere's a suggestion for revision:\n\n1. Implement a maze generation algorithm to create a guaranteed path from the start to the door.\n2. Add additional walls randomly, ensuring they do not block the existing path.\n\nThis approach will ensure that the map generation is both efficient and guarantees a valid path without the risk of an infinite loop.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code.

The game is built using Python and the Pygame library.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x installed on your system.\n- Pygame library.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n\n   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies:**\n\n   Use pip to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   This will install the Pygame library, which is necessary to run the game.\n\n## 🤔 What is this?\n\nThis game is a roguelike adventure inspired by the classic \"Tower of the Sorcerer\". It features an 80x80 grid map where players navigate through floors, encounter monsters, and collect treasures. The primary goal is to reach the door to proceed to the next level while managing your health points (HP).\n\n### Main Features\n\n- **Grid-Based Movement:** Navigate the player character using W/A/S/D keys for movement (up, left, down, right) on a fixed 80x80 grid map.\n- **Combat System:** Engage in combat with monsters by subtracting their HP from the player's HP.\n- **Treasure Collection:** Restore HP by 20–30 points when collecting treasure chests.\n- **Pathfinding:** The game ensures there is always at least one valid path from the starting position to the door.\n- **Minimal UI:** Displays the player's current HP and encountered monster stats.\n\n## 📖 How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game:**\n\n   Run the main script to start the game:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Game Controls:**\n\n   - Use `W` to move up.\n   - Use `A` to move left.\n   - Use `S` to move down.\n   - Use `D` to move right.\n\n3. **Objective:**\n\n   - Navigate through the grid to reach the door and proceed to the next level.\n   - Avoid or combat monsters to survive.\n   - Collect treasure chests to restore your HP.\n\n4. **User Interface:**\n\n   - The game window displays the grid map, player, monsters, and treasure chests.\n   - Your current HP is displayed at the top left corner of the screen.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nFor any issues or further assistance, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided within the codebase.\n\nEnjoy your adventure in the roguelike world inspired by \"Tower of the Sorcerer\"!"
