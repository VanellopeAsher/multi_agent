The application will consist of several core components:\n\n1. **Main Application Class (`CrosswordApp`)**: This will initialize the GUI, handle user interactions, and manage the overall flow of the application.\n2. **Grid Class (`CrosswordGrid`)**: This will represent the crossword grid, manage the placement of words, and validate user input.\n3. **Clue Class (`Clue`)**: This will store information about each clue, including its position, direction, and answer.\n4. **Validation Function**: This will check if the user's input matches the correct answers and confirm completion.\n\nLet's start by laying out the necessary classes and functions:\n\n### Core Classes and Functions\n\n- **CrosswordApp**: Main application class.\n  - `__init__()`: Initialize the application and GUI components.\n  - `create_widgets()`: Create and place GUI widgets.\n  - `submit_word()`: Handle word submission by the user.\n  - `check_completion()`: Check if the crossword is completed correctly.\n\n- **CrosswordGrid**: Manage the crossword grid.\n  - `__init__()`: Initialize the grid with given dimensions.\n  - `place_word()`: Place a word in the grid.\n  - `validate_word()`: Validate if a word fits in the specified position.\n\n- **Clue**: Store clue information.\n  - `__init__()`: Initialize clue with position, direction, and answer.\n\n- **Helper Functions**:\n  - `load_clues()`: Load clues from a predefined list or file.\n  - `display_clues()`: Display clues in the GUI.\n\nNow, let's implement the code for each component.\n\n### Main Application File\n\n**main.py**\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain application file for the crossword puzzle.

The `CrosswordApp` class manages the user interface and interactions, while the `CrosswordGrid` and `Clue` classes handle the grid and clues, respectively. The application can be extended with more features, such as loading clues from a file, adding more complex validation, and enhancing the GUI."

This application allows you to engage with a classic crossword puzzle, providing a grid of squares with clues for across and down entries. Users can enter words by specifying the clue number and direction, and the application will validate if the letters match and confirm completion when all correct words are filled in.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Grid Display**: A 10x10 grid is displayed where users can fill in words based on the provided clues.\n- **Clue Management**: Clues are displayed for both across and down entries, guiding users to fill in the correct words.\n- **Word Entry and Validation**: Users can enter words by specifying the clue number and direction. The application checks if the word fits the clue and the grid.\n- **Completion Check**: The application notifies users when the crossword puzzle is completed successfully.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nThis application does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. However, it is recommended to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have access to the source code repository, clone it to your local machine.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python.\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Launch the Application**: After running `main.py`, a window will open displaying the crossword grid and clues.\n\n2. **View Clues**: Clues for across and down entries are displayed below the grid. Each clue is numbered for easy reference.\n\n3. **Enter Words**: Use the entry field to input your word in the format `number direction WORD`. For example, to fill in the word \"apple\" for clue number 1 across, type `1 across apple`.\n\n4. **Submit Your Entry**: Click the \"Submit\" button to validate your word. If the word fits the clue and grid, it will be placed in the grid.\n\n5. **Check Completion**: Continue filling in words until the grid is complete. A message will notify you when the crossword is successfully completed.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Input Error**: If you receive an error message, ensure your input format is correct (`number direction WORD`) and that the clue number and direction are valid.\n- **Word Does Not Fit**: If the word does not fit, double-check the clue and your spelling.\n\nEnjoy solving the crossword puzzle!\n```"
