We'll structure the application into several classes and functions to handle different aspects of the game, such as the game logic, GUI rendering, and user interactions.\n\n### Core Classes and Functions\n\n1. **MinesweeperGame**: This class will handle the game logic, including board generation, mine placement, and game state updates.\n   - `__init__(self, rows, cols, mines)`: Initialize the game with a specified number of rows, columns, and mines.\n   - `generate_board(self)`: Create the game board and place mines.\n   - `reveal_cell(self, row, col)`: Handle the logic for revealing a cell.\n   - `flag_cell(self, row, col)`: Toggle a flag on a cell.\n   - `check_win(self)`: Determine if the player has won the game.\n\n2. **MinesweeperGUI**: This class will manage the GUI components and user interactions.\n   - `__init__(self, master, game)`: Initialize the GUI with a reference to the game logic.\n   - `create_widgets(self)`: Create the buttons and labels for the game board.\n   - `update_display(self)`: Update the GUI based on the current game state.\n   - `on_cell_click(self, row, col)`: Handle cell click events.\n   - `on_right_click(self, event, row, col)`: Handle right-click events for flagging.\n\n3. **main.py**: The main entry point of the application, which initializes the game and GUI.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n#### main.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain entry point for the Minesweeper game application.\n\n'''\n\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom minesweeper_game import MinesweeperGame\nfrom minesweeper_gui import MinesweeperGUI\n\ndef main():\n    root = tk.Tk()\n    root.title(\"Minesweeper\")\n    \n    # Set difficulty level\n    difficulty = {\n        \"beginner\": (9, 9, 10),\n        \"intermediate\": (16, 16, 40),\n        \"expert\": (16, 30, 99)\n    }\n    \n    # Choose difficulty level\n    level = \"beginner\"  # Change to \"intermediate\" or \"expert\" as needed\n    rows, cols, mines = difficulty[level]\n    \n    game = MinesweeperGame(rows, cols, mines)\n    gui = MinesweeperGUI(root, game)\n    \n    root.mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### minesweeper_game.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nHandles the game logic for Minesweeper, including board generation and game state updates.\n\n'''\n\nimport random\n\nclass MinesweeperGame:\n    def __init__(self, rows, cols, mines):\n        self.rows = rows\n        self.cols = cols\n        self.mines = mines\n        self.board = []\n        self.revealed = []\n        self.flags = []\n        self.game_over = False\n        self.generate_board()\n\n    def generate_board(self):\n        self.board = [[0 for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]\n        self.revealed = [[False for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]\n        self.flags = [[False for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]\n        \n        # Place mines\n        mine_positions = set()\n        while len(mine_positions) < self.mines:\n            r = random.randint(0, self.rows -

However, if there were any additional packages used, they would need to be included. Since no additional packages are mentioned in the code, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty. Here's how it would look:\n```\n# No additional dependencies are required for this project.\n```\nIf you plan to extend the project with additional libraries in the future, you can add them to this file.

This classic game challenges your strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. This guide will help you understand the main functions of the software, how to install it, and how to play the game.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe Minesweeper Game is designed with the following features:\n\n- **Three Levels of Difficulty**: Choose from beginner, intermediate, or expert levels to match your skill level.\n- **Interactive Gameplay**: Uncover cells by clicking on them. Numbers on uncovered cells indicate how many mines are adjacent.\n- **Flagging Mechanism**: Right-click to flag suspected mines, helping you keep track of potential dangers.\n- **Game Over and Win Conditions**: If you uncover a mine, the game ends. Successfully uncover all non-mine cells to win.\n- **Visual Feedback**: The game board updates visually after each move, with distinct visuals for flagged cells and uncovered mines.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nEnsure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Minesweeper game repository to your local machine.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the directory where the game files are located.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: The game does not require any additional dependencies beyond Python's standard library.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Choose Difficulty Level**: The game starts at the beginner level by default. You can change the difficulty level by modifying the `level` variable in the `main.py` file to \"intermediate\" or \"expert\".\n\n3. **Gameplay**:\n   - **Uncover Cells**: Click on a cell to uncover it. If it contains a mine, the game will end.\n   - **Flag Mines**: Right-click on a cell to flag it as a suspected mine. Flagged cells are marked with an \"F\" and have a yellow background.\n   - **Win the Game**: Uncover all non-mine cells to win. If you win, a congratulatory message will appear.\n\n4. **Game Over**: If you uncover a mine, the game will display a \"Game Over\" message.\n\nEnjoy the challenge and have fun playing Minesweeper! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out."
