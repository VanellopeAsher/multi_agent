The `process_input` method in `Game` should also be expanded to validate and parse the player's input correctly."

Additionally, the `process_input` method currently assumes all inputs are valid, which is not practical for a real game scenario.\n\nTo address these issues, I recommend the following revisions:\n\n1. **Implement Move Validation**: Enhance the `process_input` method in `game.py` to validate the player's input by checking if the move is legal according to chess rules. This includes verifying the move format and ensuring the move is possible for the selected piece.\n\n2. **Determine Valid Moves**: Implement the `valid_moves` method in `piece.py` for each type of piece (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king) to return a list of valid moves from a given position. This will help in checking for legal moves and enforcing game rules.\n\n3. **Check for Attacks**: Implement the `is_square_attacked` method in `chessboard.py` to determine if a square is attacked by any opponent piece. This is essential for enforcing check and checkmate conditions.\n\n4. **Handle Special Moves**: Ensure that special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion are correctly implemented and validated within the game logic.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the chess game will become more robust and adhere to the standard rules of chess, providing a better experience for the user."

The highest priority issue is the lack of implementation for critical methods, such as `is_square_attacked` and `has_valid_moves`, which are essential for determining check, checkmate, and valid moves. These methods currently contain placeholder logic and need to be fully implemented to ensure the game enforces the rules of chess correctly.\n\n**Instructions for Revision:**\n\n1. **Implement `is_square_attacked`:** This method should determine if a given square is attacked by any of the opponent's pieces. This involves checking all possible moves of the opponent's pieces to see if they can reach the specified square.\n\n2. **Implement `has_valid_moves`:** This method should iterate over all pieces of the current player and check if there are any legal moves available. It should consider the rules of chess, including checks, to determine if a move is valid.\n\n3. **Enhance `valid_moves` in `Piece` class:** The `valid_moves` method should be implemented to return a list of all possible legal moves for a piece from its current position, considering the type of piece and the current state of the board.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the chess game will be able to correctly enforce the rules of chess, including check, checkmate, and legal move validation, thereby meeting the user's requirements."

The highest priority issue is the lack of implementation for critical methods, such as `is_square_attacked` and `has_valid_moves`, which are essential for determining check, checkmate, and valid moves. These methods currently contain placeholder logic and need to be fully implemented to ensure the game enforces the rules of chess correctly.\n\n**Instructions for Revision:**\n\n1. **Implement `is_square_attacked`:** This method should determine if a given square is attacked by any of the opponent's pieces. This involves checking all possible moves of the opponent's pieces to see if they can reach the specified square.\n\n2. **Implement `has_valid_moves`:** This method should iterate over all pieces of the current player and check if there are any legal moves available. It should consider the rules of chess, including checks, to determine if a move is valid.\n\n3. **Enhance `valid_moves` in `Piece` class:** The `valid_moves` method should be implemented to return a list of all possible legal moves for a piece from its current position, considering the type of piece and the current state of the board.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the chess game will be able to correctly enforce the rules of chess, including check, checkmate, and legal move validation, thereby meeting the user's requirements.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code.

However, there are several areas in the code that could potentially lead to issues or lack of functionality, especially regarding the implementation of chess rules and game mechanics. Here is a summary of potential issues and areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Move Validation**: \n   - The `process_input` method in the `Game` class currently assumes all inputs are valid. This can lead to invalid moves being accepted, which is not ideal for a chess game. Implementing proper move validation is crucial.\n\n2. **Check and Checkmate Detection**:\n   - The `is_check` and `is_checkmate` methods in the `ChessBoard` class have simplified logic. The `is_square_attacked` method always returns `False`, which means the game does not correctly detect checks or checkmates. This needs to be implemented properly to ensure the game enforces these rules.\n\n3. **Stalemate Detection**:\n   - Similar to checkmate detection, the `is_stalemate` method relies on the `has_valid_moves` method, which currently always returns `True`. This means stalemates are not detected correctly.\n\n4. **Castling**:\n   - The `can_castle` method checks for castling rights and empty squares but does not fully implement the rule that the king and rook must not have moved previously, and the king must not pass through or end up in check. This needs to be addressed for accurate castling.\n\n5. **En Passant**:\n   - The `can_en_passant` method is present, but its integration with the move logic is not clear. Ensure that en passant captures are handled correctly in the `move_piece` method.\n\n6. **Pawn Promotion**:\n   - The `promote_pawn` method prompts the user for input, which is fine for a terminal-based game, but it should also handle invalid inputs gracefully and ensure the game continues smoothly.\n\n7. **Piece Movement Logic**:\n   - The `Piece` class has a placeholder for `valid_moves`, which means specific movement rules for each piece type are not implemented. This is essential for enforcing legal moves.\n\n8. **User Input Handling**:\n   - The game currently assumes input is always valid. Implementing input validation to ensure moves are in the correct format and within the bounds of the board is necessary.\n\n9. **Game Loop Termination**:\n   - The game loop in `start_game` runs indefinitely until a checkmate or stalemate is detected. Consider adding a way for players to resign or offer a draw.\n\nAddressing these issues will improve the functionality and accuracy of the chess game, ensuring it adheres to standard chess rules and provides a better user experience."

Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.\nYour main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.\nHere is a new customer's task: Design a chess game, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. It should be playable from Linux Terminal, and does not require me to access a dedicated UX or GUI platform, i.e. print the results on terminal at each stage and let me play it there by entering inputs (formal chess notation such as Ke8). Include standard chess features like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. Enforce check and checkmate rules..\nTo complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]\n\n```markdown\n# Terminal Chess Game\n\nA simple chess game designed to be played in the Linux Terminal. This game allows two players to take turns and determine the winner. It includes standard chess features such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion, and enforces check and checkmate rules.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nThis chess game is implemented in Python and does not require any external dependencies. To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n\n   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\n\n   Change your directory to the project folder:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory where the repository was cloned.\n\n3. **Run the Game:**\n\n   Execute the main Python script to start the game:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n## 🤔 What is this?\n\nThis is a terminal-based chess game that allows two players to play against each other using standard chess rules. The game is designed to run in a Linux terminal and does not require a graphical user interface.\n\n### Main Features\n\n- **Standard Chess Rules:** The game includes all standard chess rules, such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.\n- **Check and Checkmate:** The game enforces check and checkmate rules to determine the winner.\n- **Terminal Interface:** The game is played entirely in the terminal, with the board displayed after each move.\n- **Input Moves:** Players input their moves using formal chess notation (e.g., `Ke8`).\n\n## 📖 How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game:**\n\n   Run the `main.py` script to start the game. The chessboard will be displayed in the terminal.\n\n2. **Enter Moves:**\n\n   Players take turns entering their moves using standard chess notation. For example, to move a knight to e8, type `Ne8`.\n\n3. **Game Progression:**\n\n   After each move, the updated board will be displayed. The game will continue until a player wins by checkmate or the game ends in a stalemate.\n\n4. **Special Moves:**\n\n   - **Castling:** If castling is possible, you can perform it by moving the king two squares towards the rook.\n   - **En Passant:** If en passant is possible, capture the pawn by moving your pawn to the target square.\n   - **Pawn Promotion:** When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, you will be prompted to promote it to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.\n\n5. **Winning the Game:**\n\n   The game ends when a player checkmates the opponent's king, or if a stalemate occurs, resulting in a draw.\n\nEnjoy playing chess in your terminal!\n```"
