This will allow us to create a simple and interactive GUI for the game. The game will consist of several components, including the main game logic, the GUI setup, and the feedback mechanism for the player's guesses.\n\n### Core Classes and Functions\n\n1. **MastermindGame**: \n   - Purpose: Handle the game logic, including generating the secret code, checking guesses, and determining win/lose conditions.\n   - Methods:\n     - `generate_secret_code()`: Generate a random sequence of colors.\n     - `check_guess(guess)`: Compare the player's guess to the secret code and return feedback.\n     - `is_game_over()`: Determine if the game is over (win or lose).\n\n2. **MastermindGUI**:\n   - Purpose: Create and manage the graphical user interface for the game.\n   - Methods:\n     - `setup_gui()`: Initialize the GUI components.\n     - `submit_guess()`: Handle the player's guess submission and update the interface with feedback.\n\n3. **Utility Functions**:\n   - Purpose: Helper functions for various tasks such as color validation or feedback formatting.\n\n### File Structure\n\n1. **main.py**: The entry point of the application, initializing the game and GUI.\n2. **game_logic.py**: Contains the `MastermindGame` class.\n3. **gui.py**: Contains the `MastermindGUI` class.\n\nLet's implement the code for each file:\n\n#### main.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain entry point for the Mastermind game application.\n\n'''\n\nfrom gui import MastermindGUI\n\ndef main():\n    game_gui = MastermindGUI()\n    game_gui.setup_gui()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### game_logic.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nContains the MastermindGame class which handles the game logic.\n\n'''\n\nimport random\n\nclass MastermindGame:\n    COLORS = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Orange', 'Purple']\n    CODE_LENGTH = 4\n    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 10\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.secret_code = self.generate_secret_code()\n        self.attempts = 0\n\n    def generate_secret_code(self):\n        return [random.choice(self.COLORS) for _ in range(self.CODE_LENGTH)]\n\n    def check_guess(self, guess):\n        if len(guess) != self.CODE_LENGTH:\n            raise ValueError(\"Guess must have exactly {} colors.\".format(self.CODE_LENGTH))\n\n        exact_matches = sum(1 for i in range(self.CODE_LENGTH) if guess[i] == self.secret_code[i])\n        color_matches = sum(min(guess.count(color), self.secret_code.count(color)) for color in set(self.COLORS)) - exact_matches\n\n        self.attempts += 1\n        return exact_matches, color_matches\n\n    def is_game_over(self):\n        return self.attempts >= self.MAX_ATTEMPTS\n```\n\n#### gui.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nContains the MastermindGUI class which handles the graphical user interface.\n\n'''\n\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\nfrom game_logic import MastermindGame\n\nclass MastermindGUI:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.game = MastermindGame()\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        self.root.title(\"Mastermind Game\")\n        self.guess_entries = []\n        self.feedback_labels = []\n\n    def setup_gui(self):\n        tk.Label(self.root, text=\"Enter your guess:\").grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=2)\n\n        for i in range(MastermindGame.CODE_LENGTH):\n            entry = tk.Entry(self.root)\n            entry.grid(row=1, column=i)\n            self.guess_entries.append(entry)\n\n        submit_button = tk.Button(self.root, text=\"Submit Guess\", command=self.submit_guess)\n        submit_button.grid(row=2, column=0, columnspan=2)\n\n        self.feedback_label = tk.Label(self.root, text=\"\")\n        self.feedback_label.grid(row=3, column=0, columnspan=2)\n\n        self.root.mainloop()\n\n    def submit_guess(self):\n        guess = [entry.get().capitalize() for entry in self.guess_entries]\n        try:\n            exact, partial = self.game.check_guess(guess)\n            feedback = f\"Exact matches: {exact}, Partial matches: {partial}\"\n            self.feedback_label.config(text=feedback)\n\n            if exact == MastermindGame.CODE_LENGTH:\n                messagebox.showinfo(\"Mastermind\", \"Congratulations!

This classic code-breaking game challenges you to guess a hidden sequence of colors within a set number of tries. After each guess, you'll receive feedback on how many colors are correct and in the correct position, as well as how many colors are correct but in the wrong position. Can you crack the code before your attempts run out?\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo get started with the Mastermind Game, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The game uses the `tkinter` library, which is part of the Python standard library, so no additional external packages are required.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Python version 3.6 or higher\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n\n   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\n\n   Change into the project directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<project-directory>` with the actual directory name.\n\n3. **Run the Game:**\n\n   Execute the following command to start the game:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n## 🤔 What is this?\n\nThe Mastermind Game is a fun and challenging puzzle game where the computer selects a hidden sequence of colors, and you attempt to guess it within a set number of tries. The game provides feedback on your guesses, helping you to deduce the correct sequence.\n\n### Main Features\n\n- **Random Code Generation:** The computer randomly selects a sequence of colors from a predefined set.\n- **Feedback System:** After each guess, receive feedback on exact matches (correct color and position) and color matches (correct color, wrong position).\n- **Win/Lose Outcome:** The game provides a clear win or lose outcome based on your ability to guess the sequence within the allowed attempts.\n\n## 📖 How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game:**\n\n   Launch the game by running `python main.py`. A graphical user interface (GUI) will appear.\n\n2. **Enter Your Guess:**\n\n   - Enter your guess in the provided input fields. Each field represents a color in the sequence.\n   - Use the following color codes: R (Red), G (Green), B (Blue), Y (Yellow), O (Orange), P (Purple).\n\n3. **Submit Your Guess:**\n\n   - Click the \"Submit Guess\" button to submit your guess.\n   - The game will provide feedback on your guess, indicating the number of exact matches and color matches.\n\n4. **Win or Lose:**\n\n   - If you guess the correct sequence within the allowed attempts, you win!\n   - If you use all your attempts without guessing the sequence, the game will reveal the correct code.\n\nEnjoy playing the Mastermind Game and challenge yourself to crack the code!\n\n```"
