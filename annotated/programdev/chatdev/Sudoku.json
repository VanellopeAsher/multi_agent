This application allows you to play the classic Sudoku game on a 9x9 grid. The objective is to fill the grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1 through 9 exactly once.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Grid Initialization**: The game starts with a 9x9 grid initialized with zeros, representing empty cells.\n- **Value Input**: Players can input values into specific cells.\n- **Mistake Checking**: The game checks if the inputted values are valid according to Sudoku rules.\n- **Completion Confirmation**: The game notifies the player when the puzzle is completed correctly.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nThis application is built using Python and Tkinter, which is part of the Python standard library. Therefore, no external dependencies are required. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the Sudoku game code.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.\n\n3. **Run the Game**: Execute the following command to start the game:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. **Launch the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to launch the Sudoku game application.\n\n2. **Input Values**: Click on any cell in the grid to input a number between 1 and 9. Use the keyboard to type the number.\n\n3. **Check for Mistakes**: The game will automatically check if the inputted number is valid. If the number violates Sudoku rules, it will be removed from the cell.\n\n4. **Complete the Puzzle**: Continue filling in the grid until all cells are correctly filled. The game will notify you with a congratulatory message once the puzzle is completed correctly.\n\n5. **Restart**: Close and reopen the application to start a new game.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Invalid Input**: If you input an invalid number, it will be automatically removed. Ensure the number you input does not already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.\n\n- **Application Issues**: If the application does not start, ensure Python is installed correctly and you are executing the `main.py` file from the correct directory.\n\nEnjoy playing Sudoku and challenge yourself to solve the puzzle!\n```"
