However, there is a significant issue with the `GUI` class in `gui.py`. The current implementation of the `GUI` class uses `pygame` for graphical elements, but the `draw_board` method does not actually draw any board elements, and the `update_display` method only prints messages to the console instead of updating the graphical interface. This does not meet the requirement for displaying relevant game information and prompting each player for decisions through a graphical interface.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe `GUI` class needs to be fully implemented to visually represent the game board and player interactions using `pygame`. Currently, it only initializes a window and prints messages to the console, which does not fulfill the requirement for a graphical user interface.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. **Implement Board Drawing**: Enhance the `draw_board` method to visually represent the game board, including properties and player positions. Use `pygame` drawing functions to create a visual layout of the board.\n\n2. **Update Display Method**: Modify the `update_display` method to update the graphical interface with game information, such as player turns, current player positions, and property ownership. This could involve rendering text onto the screen using `pygame.font`.\n\n3. **Handle Player Decisions**: Implement a method to handle player decisions through the graphical interface, such as buying properties or drawing chance cards. This could involve creating buttons or interactive elements within the `pygame` window.\n\n4. **Event Handling**: Ensure the `handle_events` method processes user inputs effectively, allowing players to interact with the game through the graphical interface.\n\nBy addressing these points, the game will provide a more interactive and visually appealing experience, aligning with the user's requirements for a simplified Monopoly Go! game with a graphical interface."

However, there is a significant issue with the `GUI` class in `gui.py`. The current implementation of the `GUI` class uses `pygame` for graphical elements, but the `draw_board` method does not actually draw any board elements, and the `update_display` method only prints messages to the console instead of updating the graphical interface. This does not meet the requirement for displaying relevant game information and prompting each player for decisions through a graphical interface.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe `GUI` class needs to be fully implemented to visually represent the game board and player interactions using `pygame`. Currently, it only initializes a window and prints messages to the console, which does not fulfill the requirement for a graphical user interface.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. **Implement Board Drawing**: Enhance the `draw_board` method to visually represent the game board, including properties and player positions. Use `pygame` drawing functions to create a visual layout of the board.\n\n2. **Update Display Method**: Modify the `update_display` method to update the graphical interface with game information, such as player turns, current player positions, and property ownership. This could involve rendering text onto the screen using `pygame.font`.\n\n3. **Handle Player Decisions**: Implement a method to handle player decisions through the graphical interface, such as buying properties or drawing chance cards. This could involve creating buttons or interactive elements within the `pygame` window.\n\n4. **Event Handling**: Ensure the `handle_events` method processes user inputs effectively, allowing players to interact with the game through the graphical interface.\n\nBy addressing these points, the game will provide a more interactive and visually appealing experience, aligning with the user's requirements for a simplified Monopoly Go! game with a graphical interface.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

Here are the potential causes and solutions for this issue:\n\n1. **Missing Import Statement**: \n   - **Cause**: The `Property` class is defined in `property.py`, but it is not imported into `gui.py`.\n   - **Solution**: Add an import statement for the `Property` class at the beginning of `gui.py`. This can be done by adding `from property import Property` at the top of the file.\n\n2. **Incorrect Module Structure**:\n   - **Cause**: If the project structure does not allow for proper module imports, it could lead to such errors.\n   - **Solution**: Ensure that all Python files are in the same directory or properly structured as a package, and that the Python path is correctly set up to recognize these modules.\n\nBy addressing the missing import statement, the `NameError` should be resolved, allowing the `draw_board` method to correctly identify and use the `Property` class."

The specific error is that the name 'Property' is not defined. This suggests that the `Property` class is not recognized within the `gui.py` file. Here are the potential causes and solutions for this issue:\n\n1. **Missing Import Statement**: \n   - **Cause**: The `Property` class is defined in `property.py`, but it is not imported into `gui.py`.\n   - **Solution**: Add an import statement for the `Property` class at the beginning of `gui.py`. This can be done by adding `from property import Property` at the top of the file.\n\n2. **Incorrect Module Structure**:\n   - **Cause**: If the project structure does not allow for proper module imports, it could lead to such errors.\n   - **Solution**: Ensure that all Python files are in the same directory or properly structured as a package, and that the Python path is correctly set up to recognize these modules.\n\nBy addressing the missing import statement, the `NameError` should be resolved, allowing the `draw_board` method to correctly identify and use the `Property` class.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete \"TODO\" codes are strictly prohibited).

As a result, when the code tries to use `Property` to check the type of a space, it cannot find the definition of `Property`, leading to a `NameError`.\n\n3. **Solution**: To resolve this issue, you need to import the `Property` class into the `gui.py` file. Add the following import statement at the beginning of `gui.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   from property import Property\n   ```\n\nBy importing the `Property` class, the `isinstance` check will be able to correctly identify spaces that are instances of `Property`, and the error should be resolved."

However, if the `roll` value is such that it causes the player's position to exceed the number of spaces on the board, it will result in an `IndexError` when trying to access `self.spaces[position]`.\n\n2. **Insufficient Spaces on the Board**: The `Board` class is initialized with only three spaces: two properties and one chance card. This is likely not enough to accommodate the typical movement range of a player in a Monopoly-style game, where dice rolls can range from 2 to 12.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should ensure that the board has enough spaces to accommodate typical player movement. You can do this by adding more spaces to the `self.spaces` list in the `Board` class. Additionally, verify that the player's position is correctly calculated and does not exceed the available indices in the `self.spaces` list."

Simplified Version\n\nWelcome to the user manual for the simplified version of Monopoly Go! This application is a digital adaptation of the classic board game, designed to provide an engaging experience with basic board mechanics. This manual will guide you through the main functions of the software, how to install the necessary environment dependencies, and how to play the game.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nMonopoly Go! includes the following core features:\n\n- **Rolling Dice**: Players roll two six-sided dice to determine their movement around the board.\n- **Moving Around Properties**: Players move their tokens around the board based on the dice roll.\n- **Buying Properties**: Players can purchase properties they land on if they are not already owned.\n- **Collecting Rent**: Players must pay rent to the property owner when landing on a property owned by another player.\n- **Handling Chance Events**: Players draw chance cards that can have various effects, such as going to jail or collecting money.\n- **Tracking Player Money and Property Ownership**: The game keeps track of each player's money and the properties they own.\n- **Implementing Essential Rules**: Includes simplified rules for jail, free parking, and chance cards.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo run Monopoly Go!, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the game requires the `pygame` library for graphical elements. Follow these steps to set up your environment:\n\n1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required dependencies. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   This will install the `pygame` library, which is necessary for running the game.\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game. You can do this by navigating to the directory containing the game files in your terminal or command prompt and executing:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Game Interface**: The game will open a window displaying the board and player positions. The game is played in turns, with each player rolling the dice and moving their token accordingly.\n\n3. **Player Actions**: During a player's turn, they can perform the following actions:\n   - **Roll Dice**: Automatically done at the start of each turn.\n   - **Move**: The player moves their token based on the dice roll.\n   - **Buy Property**: If the player lands on an unowned property, they can choose to buy it.\n   - **Pay Rent**: If the player lands on a property owned by another player, they must pay rent.\n   - **Chance Cards**: If the player lands on a chance space, a card is drawn, and its effect is applied.\n\n4. **Game End**: The game continues until a player is bankrupt (money less than 0 and no properties), at which point the game ends, and a winner is declared.\n\n5. **Exiting the Game**: You can exit the game at any time by closing the game window.\n\nEnjoy playing Monopoly Go! and may the best strategist win!\n```"
