Use a standard 3x3 grid, track each player's moves. Players alternate placing X or O, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full..\nTo complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]\n\n```markdown\n# Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\nA simple and user-friendly Tic-Tac-Toe game application built using Python and Tkinter. This game allows two players to take turns placing X or O on a standard 3x3 grid, with the game ending when a player wins or the board is full.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nThis application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n\n## 🤔 What is this?\n\nThe Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player game where players alternate turns to place their respective markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to get three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal. The game also ends in a draw if all spaces are filled without a winner.\n\n## 📖 Main Functions\n\n- **User-Friendly Interface**: The game features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it easy to play.\n- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two players to play against each other on the same device.\n- **Winner Determination**: Automatically checks for a winner or a draw after each move.\n- **Game Reset**: Automatically resets the game board after a game ends, allowing for continuous play.\n\n## 🚀 How to Install and Run\n\n1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Download the Code**: Save the provided `main.py` file to your local machine.\n\n3. **Run the Application**:\n   - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.\n   - Run the command: `python main.py`\n\n4. **Play the Game**:\n   - The game window will open, displaying a 3x3 grid.\n   - Player X starts the game by clicking on a cell to place an X.\n   - Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their markers.\n   - The game will automatically announce the winner or a draw and reset the board for a new game.\n\n## 🎮 How to Play\n\n- **Starting the Game**: The game begins with Player X. Click on any empty cell to place your marker.\n- **Taking Turns**: Players alternate turns, clicking on empty cells to place their markers.\n- **Winning the Game**: The first player to align three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal wins.\n- **Ending in a Draw**: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.\n- **Restarting**: After a game ends, the board resets automatically for a new game.\n\nEnjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe with your friends and family!\n```"
