However, there is a potential issue with the bird's collision detection with the ground. The current implementation sets the bird's position to 585 when it hits the ground, but it doesn't stop the game immediately. This could lead to a situation where the bird appears to be stuck at the ground level without ending the game.\n\n**Comment with the highest priority:** Ensure that the game ends immediately when the bird collides with the ground.\n\n**Suggestion for revision:**\nIn the `Bird` class, within the `update` method, modify the ground collision logic to set `self.running = False` in the `Game` class when the bird hits the ground. You can achieve this by adding a method in the `Game` class to handle game over scenarios and call it from the `Bird` class.\n\nHere's a suggested change:\n\n```python\n# In game.py\nclass Game:\n    # ... existing code ...\n    def game_over(self):\n        self.running = False\n\n# In bird.py\nclass Bird:\n    # ... existing code ...\n    def update(self, game):\n        self.velocity += self.gravity\n        self.y += self.velocity\n        if self.y > 585:  # Ground collision\n            self.y = 585\n            self.velocity = 0\n            game.game_over()  # End the game when the bird hits the ground\n```\n\nAnd update the `update` method call in `game.py`:\n\n```python\n# In game.py\ndef update(self):\n    self.bird.update(self)  # Pass the game instance to the bird\n    # ... existing code ...\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the game ends immediately when the bird hits the ground, aligning with the task requirements."

However, there is a potential issue with the bird's collision detection with the ground. The current implementation sets the bird's position to 585 when it hits the ground, but it doesn't stop the game immediately. This could lead to a situation where the bird appears to be stuck at the ground level without ending the game.\n\n**Comment with the highest priority:** Ensure that the game ends immediately when the bird collides with the ground.\n\n**Suggestion for revision:**\nIn the `Bird` class, within the `update` method, modify the ground collision logic to set `self.running = False` in the `Game` class when the bird hits the ground. You can achieve this by adding a method in the `Game` class to handle game over scenarios and call it from the `Bird` class.\n\nHere's a suggested change:\n\n```python\n# In game.py\nclass Game:\n    # ... existing code ...\n    def game_over(self):\n        self.running = False\n\n# In bird.py\nclass Bird:\n    # ... existing code ...\n    def update(self, game):\n        self.velocity += self.gravity\n        self.y += self.velocity\n        if self.y > 585:  # Ground collision\n            self.y = 585\n            self.velocity = 0\n            game.game_over()  # End the game when the bird hits the ground\n```\n\nAnd update the `update` method call in `game.py`:\n\n```python\n# In game.py\ndef update(self):\n    self.bird.update(self)  # Pass the game instance to the bird\n    # ... existing code ...\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the game ends immediately when the bird hits the ground, aligning with the task requirements.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

The game increases in difficulty as you progress, challenging your reflexes and timing.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Flap to Fly**: Press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and gain altitude.\n- **Avoid Obstacles**: Navigate through randomly generated gaps in pipes to keep the bird flying.\n- **Score Points**: Each successful pass through a gap increases your score.\n- **Game Over**: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.\n- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game becomes more challenging as your score increases, with smaller gaps and faster pipes.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo run the Flappy Bird clone, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:\n\n1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n\n2. **Install Pygame**: Use pip to install Pygame, which is required to run the game.\n   ```bash\n   pip install pygame>=2.0.0\n   ```\n\n3. **Clone the Repository**: Download the game files from the repository or copy the provided code files into a directory on your system.\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Control the Bird**: Use the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings. The bird will fall due to gravity, so keep pressing the spacebar to maintain altitude.\n\n3. **Navigate the Pipes**: Avoid hitting the pipes by flying through the gaps. The gaps are randomly generated and will become smaller as your score increases.\n\n4. **Score Points**: Each time you successfully pass through a gap, your score increases. The score is displayed at the top left corner of the screen.\n\n5. **Game Over**: The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground. You can restart the game by running `main.py` again.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more detailed information on the game's code and structure, refer to the following files:\n\n- **main.py**: Initializes and runs the game.\n- **game.py**: Manages the game loop, events, and game state.\n- **bird.py**: Handles the bird's movement and collision detection.\n- **pipe.py**: Manages the pipes' movement and collision detection.\n- **score.py**: Keeps track of and displays the player's score.\n- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for collision detection and random gap generation.\n\nEnjoy the game and challenge yourself to achieve a high score!\n```"
