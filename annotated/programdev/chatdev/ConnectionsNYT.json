The current implementation does not include any mechanism to assign or display color-coded difficulty levels (yellow, green, blue, purple) for the categories when a correct group is identified.\n\nTo fix this, you should:\n\n1. Modify the `Puzzle` class to include a mapping of categories to their respective difficulty colors.\n2. Update the `check_group` method to return both the category and its associated color.\n3. Adjust the `select_word` method in `PuzzleGameApp` to display the color-coded feedback when a correct group is identified.\n\nHere's a suggestion for how you might implement these changes:\n\n```python\n# In puzzle.py, modify the Puzzle class to include difficulty colors\nclass Puzzle:\n    def __init__(self, words, categories, difficulty_colors):\n        '''\n        Initializes the Puzzle with words, categories, and difficulty colors.\n        '''\n        self.words = words\n        self.categories = categories\n        self.difficulty_colors = difficulty_colors\n        self.selected_words = []\n        self.correct_groups = []\n\n    def check_group(self, selected_words):\n        '''\n        Checks if the selected words form a correct group.\n        Returns the category and its color if correct, otherwise None.\n        '''\n        for category, words in self.categories.items():\n            if set(selected_words) == set(words):\n                return category, self.difficulty_colors[category]\n        return None, None\n\n# In daily_puzzle.py, update the puzzles to include difficulty colors\ndef load_puzzles(self):\n    return [\n        Puzzle(\n            [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"fish\", \"bird\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"car\", \"bus\", \"bike\", \"train\"],\n            {\"fruits\": [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\"], \"animals\": [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"fish\", \"bird\"], \"colors\": [\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\"], \"vehicles\": [\"car\", \"bus\", \"bike\", \"train\"]},\n            {\"fruits\": \"yellow\", \"animals\": \"green\", \"colors\": \"blue\", \"vehicles\": \"purple\"}\n        ),\n        # Add more puzzles as needed\n    ]\n\n# In main.py, update the select_word method to display color-coded feedback\ndef select_word(self, i, j):\n    # Logic for selecting a word and checking if a group is correct\n    word = self.puzzle.words[i*4+j]\n    if word not in self.selected_words:\n        self.selected_words.append(word)\n        self.buttons[i][j].config(state=\"disabled\")\n    if len(self.selected_words) == 4:\n        category, color = self.puzzle.check_group(self.selected_words)\n        if category:\n            self.feedback_label.config(text=f\"Correct!

Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

For example:\nrequirements.txt\n```\nnumpy==1.19.2\npandas>=1.1.4\n```\nAccording to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.\n\nProgrammer: Based on the provided code, the project primarily uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface, which is included with Python's standard library and does not need to be listed in `requirements.txt`. However, if there are any additional libraries or dependencies used in the project that are not part of the standard library, they should be included. Since the code does not explicitly mention any external libraries, the `requirements.txt` file will be minimal. Here is an example:\n```plaintext\n# requirements.txt\n# No external libraries are required for this project as it uses tkinter, which is part of the Python standard library.\n```\nIf you plan to extend the project with additional features that require external libraries, you would list those libraries and their versions in this file. For example, if you decide to use a library for advanced date handling or additional GUI components, you would add them here.

You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the game repository from the source.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: \n\n   ```bash\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using pip.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you may need to manually install packages like `tkinter` and any other dependencies mentioned in the code.\n\n## Game Features\n\n- **4x4 Word Grid**: Words are displayed in a 4x4 grid for easy selection.\n- **Category Grouping**: Group words into categories such as fruits, animals, colors, and vehicles.\n- **Color-Coded Feedback**: Correct groups are highlighted with color-coded difficulty levels.\n- **Mistake Tracking**: Players can make up to four mistakes before the game ends.\n- **Daily Puzzle**: A new puzzle is generated every day, providing continuous engagement.\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the main application file to start the game.\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Select Words**: Click on words in the grid to select them. Select four words to form a group.\n\n3. **Check Group**: Once four words are selected, the game will automatically check if they form a correct group.\n\n4. **Feedback**: Receive immediate feedback. Correct groups are removed and revealed with their category and color. Incorrect guesses increase the mistake count.\n\n5. **Game Over**: The game ends if you make four mistakes.\n\n6. **Reset Game**: Use the reset button to start a new game with a fresh puzzle.\n\n## Daily Puzzle\n\nThe game features a daily puzzle that changes every day. This ensures that players have a new challenge to look forward to each day. The daily puzzle is generated based on the current date, providing a unique puzzle experience.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Game Not Starting**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and that Python is correctly set up on your system.\n- **GUI Issues**: If the GUI does not display correctly, check your Python installation and ensure `tkinter` is installed.\n- **Puzzle Not Loading**: Verify that the `daily_puzzle.py` file is correctly loading puzzles and that the date-based logic is functioning.\n\nFor further assistance, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided in the source code. Enjoy the Puzzle Game and challenge your word grouping skills!"
