Specifically, this approach checks for the presence and frequency of each letter from the theme words and spangram on the board but does not verify the actual placement and sequence of letters that constitute each word. Therefore, it's possible for words to technically not \"overlap\" by this count-based method but still intersect or overlap on the board in a way that violates the game's rules (e.g., sharing letters or parts of words in unintended ways). A more robust test would involve checking the specific paths of words on the board to ensure they maintain their integrity and do not intersect in a manner that changes their spelling or creates unintended additional words.\n"
