For instance, tests like `test_move_into_wall` assume that the player's initial left position is always a wall, and similar assumptions are made for the placement of monsters, chests, and the door in other tests. This approach does not account for the variability introduced by the random map generation feature of the game, potentially leading to situations where these tests could fail simply because the randomly generated map did not meet the test's assumptions.\n\nA more robust testing strategy would involve creating a controlled environment for each test case, where the conditions necessary for the test are explicitly set up within the test itself or through mocking/stubbing the map generation process. This would ensure that the tests are evaluating the game mechanics in isolation, without being inadvertently affected by the randomness of the map generation.\n"
