Specifically, there are no tests for situations where multiple directions of opponent's discs should be flipped in a single move, nor are there tests for checking the game's behavior when no valid moves are available for either player due to the board being full or other strategic reasons. Additionally, the tests do not cover scenarios where a move would not result in any disc being flipped (which should be an invalid move), or the transition of game states from one player having no valid moves to the other player continuing to play.
