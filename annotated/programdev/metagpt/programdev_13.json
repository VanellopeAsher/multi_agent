This test assumes that calling `generate_daily_puzzle()` a second time will result in a different order of words in the grid, comparing the initial grid to the shuffled grid to check for a shuffle. However, since the puzzle generation is seeded with the current date (`random.seed(datetime.now().date().toordinal())`), regenerating the puzzle within the same test run (likely executed within the same day) will produce the same order of words, not a different one as the test expects. This misunderstanding of the seeding mechanism could lead to a false failure of the test, as the shuffle functionality is not actually being tested under these conditions. A more effective approach would be to test the shuffle functionality by directly manipulating the seed or comparing the order of words in the grid across different days, ensuring the test accurately reflects the shuffle behavior.\n"

This test aims to ensure that there are no duplicate words in the grid by comparing the length of the list of words (minus the pipe characters used for formatting) to the length of a set created from this list. However, the method used to extract words from the grid string might not be robust enough, as it relies on splitting the string by spaces. This approach does not account for potential issues such as leading or trailing spaces around words or the inclusion of newline characters (`\\n`) in the list of words. A more accurate approach would involve a cleaner extraction of words, ensuring that only the actual words are compared, and all formatting characters (pipes and newlines) are properly excluded before the comparison. This would provide a more reliable test for detecting duplicates in the grid.\n"
