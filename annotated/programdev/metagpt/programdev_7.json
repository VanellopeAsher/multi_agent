However, a critical comment on the current set of test cases is the absence of tests specifically designed to verify the correct handling of attempts to place stones outside the bounds of the board. Such tests are crucial for ensuring the robustness of the game's input validation mechanism. Without these tests, there's a risk that the game might not properly handle or report errors when a player attempts to place a stone at an invalid position (e.g., row or column numbers less than 0 or greater than 14), potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. Incorporating tests that validate the game's response to out-of-bounds inputs would enhance the test suite's comprehensiveness and the game's overall reliability.\n"
