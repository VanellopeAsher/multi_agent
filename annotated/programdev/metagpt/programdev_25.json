However, there's a fundamental issue in the design of these tests: they do not directly modify or check the global `score_updated` flag within the actual game logic. The tests assume a static input for `score_updated` without considering its dynamic change during the game's execution. In a real scenario, the `score_updated` flag would be altered by the game logic itself, not passed as an argument to the function. This discrepancy means the tests might not accurately reflect how the `update_score` function interacts with the `score_updated` flag during gameplay. To fully address this, the testing approach would need to simulate or mock the game's flow to test the function's behavior in a context that mirrors actual gameplay, where `score_updated` is managed by the game's state rather than provided as an input.\n"
