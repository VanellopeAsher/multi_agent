However, a critical comment on these tests is the absence of scenarios that involve complex player interactions and the game's response to various edge cases. For instance, there are no tests for situations where a player lands on a property with a house or hotel (since this version might not include them, a test for enhanced rent scenarios could be considered if implemented), nor are there tests for handling auctions when a player decides not to buy an available property, assuming such a rule would be added for a more complete game experience. Additionally, the tests do not cover the dynamics of a player going bankrupt to another player (transferring property ownership) or the game's end conditions beyond a single bankruptcy. Expanding the test suite to cover these aspects would significantly improve the robustness and completeness of the game's testing framework.\n"
