For instance, there are no tests to ensure the system behaves correctly when negative amounts are added as income, expenses, or savings, which could potentially lead to incorrect budget tracking. Additionally, there are no tests to verify the behavior of the system when non-numeric inputs are provided to the `add_income`, `add_expense`, or `add_saving` methods. Incorporating tests for these scenarios would significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of the `BudgetTracker` class by ensuring it can gracefully handle a wider range of inputs and situations.\n"

In real-world scenarios, allowing negative values for income, expenses, and savings without any form of validation or error handling could lead to misuse or misunderstanding of the budget tracking system. It would be more beneficial to include tests that ensure the system either rejects negative values with appropriate error messages or handles them in a way that aligns with financial tracking principles, rather than simply asserting that negative values are acceptable without questioning the logic behind this functionality.\n"
