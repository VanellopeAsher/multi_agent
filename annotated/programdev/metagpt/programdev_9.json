While `test_move_makes_changes()` checks if a move ('UP' in this case) results in a change to the grid, it does not ensure that moves in all directions are handled correctly and result in the expected grid transformations. This is important for thoroughly testing the game's core functionality, as the ability to move tiles in all directions and merge them appropriately is fundamental to the 2048 game's mechanics. Adding separate tests for each direction could help ensure that the game logic correctly interprets and executes moves in every possible direction.\n"
