The `uncover` method in the `Minesweeper` class is designed not only to uncover the selected cell but also to automatically uncover adjacent cells if the selected cell's value is '0', indicating no adjacent mines. This feature is crucial for the gameplay experience, as it significantly reduces the number of clicks a player needs to make on safe areas of the board. However, there is no test case specifically designed to verify that adjacent cells are correctly uncovered when a cell with '0' adjacent mines is uncovered. Testing this functionality would ensure that the game behaves as expected in scenarios where uncovering one cell should lead to multiple cells being uncovered automatically.\n"

While there are tests for uncovering cells, flagging cells, and the game's behavior upon uncovering a mine, there is no explicit test to ensure that upon game initialization (or after placing mines and before any player actions), the cells correctly represent the number of adjacent mines. This is fundamental to Minesweeper gameplay, as it directly affects the player's strategy and decisions. Ensuring that each cell is initialized with the correct number of adjacent mines would validate the core logic that determines the game's difficulty and player engagement. Without such a test, there could be undetected issues in how the game calculates and displays these numbers, potentially leading to a confusing or inconsistent gaming experience.\n"
