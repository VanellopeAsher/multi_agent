      "content": "The test cases provided offer a good range of scenarios to ensure the tic-tac-toe game functions correctly under various conditions, including winning by row, column, diagonal, drawing, and handling invalid moves. However, a critical observation is that the test suite lacks direct testing of user interactions, such as input validation for row and column entries. Specifically, there's no test case to ensure the game correctly handles non-integer inputs or integers that are out of the specified range (0-2) for rows and columns. This scenario is crucial for maintaining a user-friendly interface and ensuring the game's robustness against unexpected or erroneous user inputs. Adding test cases to verify that the game prompts the user again without crashing or proceeding incorrectly when faced with invalid input types (e.g., strings, negative numbers, or numbers larger than 2) would significantly enhance the test suite's coverage and the game's overall user experience.\n"
