The function `detect_palindromes` is designed to filter out non-alphanumeric characters and convert all letters to lowercase before checking if a word is a palindrome. This implies that the function should be able to identify palindromes consisting of alphanumeric characters (e.g., \"A1b2b1a\", \"12321\"). However, none of the test cases explicitly test for scenarios where the palindromes include numeric characters or a mix of letters and numbers, which is a relevant scenario given the function's implementation. Adding a test case to cover alphanumeric palindromes would ensure the function's robustness in handling a wider variety of palindromic patterns.\n"
