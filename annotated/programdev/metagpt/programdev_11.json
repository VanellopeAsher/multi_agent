This scenario is important for accurately testing the game's logic in handling guesses. For example, if the target word is \"apple\" and the guess is \"ppppp\", the test should verify that only the first two 'p's are marked as yellow (assuming they are in the wrong position) or green (if in the correct position), and the rest should be grey, indicating invalid letters in the context of the word's composition. This test case would ensure the game correctly handles duplicate letters in guesses relative to their occurrence in the target word, which is a common edge case in word games like Wordle.\n"

For example, if the target word is \"ballo\" and the player guesses \"bolls\", the test suite does not explicitly verify how the game logic differentiates between the correct placement and number of 'l's in the guess compared to the target word. This scenario tests the game's ability to accurately provide feedback when the guess has fewer occurrences of a letter that appears multiple times in the answer.
