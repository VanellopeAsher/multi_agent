For example, there are no tests for the rotation functionality of the pieces to ensure that a piece can correctly rotate within the bounds of the grid and without overlapping with locked positions. Testing rotation is essential because it directly impacts the gameplay, allowing players to fit pieces into tight spaces and clear multiple rows simultaneously. Without verifying the correct behavior of piece rotation, especially near the edges of the board or when close to other locked pieces, there's a risk that the game might not respond as expected during these critical moments, potentially frustrating players or leading to incorrect game states.\n"
