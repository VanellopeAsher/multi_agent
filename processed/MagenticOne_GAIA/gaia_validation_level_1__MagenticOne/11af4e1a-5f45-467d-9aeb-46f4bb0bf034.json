      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nHow many more blocks (also denoted as layers) in BERT base encoder than the encoder from the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request compares the BERT base encoder and the encoder architecture from \"Attention is All You Need.\"\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The number of blocks (layers) in the BERT base encoder. This information can be found in the original BERT research paper by Devlin et al., titled \"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.\"\n   - The number of blocks (layers) in the encoder from the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper by Vaswani et al. This information can be found in the original research paper itself.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The difference in the number of blocks between the BERT base encoder and the encoder from \"Attention is All You Need.\"\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Based on memory, the BERT base model consists of 12 layers (blocks).\n   - The encoder in \"Attention is All You Need\" also has 6 layers.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- WebSurfer will perform web searches to verify the number of layers in both the BERT base encoder and the encoder from the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper. Specific sources to check will be the original BERT paper by Devlin et al., and the original paper by Vaswani et al.\n- WebSurfer will also cross-reference any findings with authoritative AI research databases or notable AI-focused educational resources to ensure accuracy.\n- Once the layer counts are verified, Assistant will calculate the difference between the number of blocks in BERT base and the \"Attention is All You Need\" encoder.\n- Assistant will provide the final answer, detailing how many more layers the BERT base encoder has than the encoder from the \"Attention is All You Need\" architecture."

These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\njor limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\nporate context from both directions.\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations\nfrom Transformers.\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful.\nIt obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n1\nIntroduction\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\njor limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\nporate context from both directions.\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations\nfrom Transformers.\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\nword based only on its context. Unlike left-to-\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\nIn addi-\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer.\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Un-\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\ntuning based representation model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks,"

There is mini-\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024.\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\nBERTBERTE[CLS]E1 E[SEP]...ENE1’...EM’CT1T[SEP]...TNT1’...TM’[CLS]Tok 1 [SEP]...Tok NTok 1...TokMQuestionParagraphStart/End SpanBERTE[CLS]E1 E[SEP]...ENE1’...EM’CT1T[SEP]...TNT1’...TM’[CLS]Tok 1 [SEP]...Tok NTok 1...TokMMasked Sentence AMasked Sentence BPre-trainingFine-TuningNSPMask LMMask LMUnlabeled Sentence A and B Pair SQuADQuestion Answer PairNERMNLI\nInput/Output Representations To make BERT\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\n(e.g., (cid:104) Question, Answer (cid:105)) in one token sequence.\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\nsiﬁcation token ([CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ RH ,\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\nas Ti ∈ RH .\nFor a given token, its input representation is\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\nstandard conditional language models can only be\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\nstructing the entire input.\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\nnot always"
