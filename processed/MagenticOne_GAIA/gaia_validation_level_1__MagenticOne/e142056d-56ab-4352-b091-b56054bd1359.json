  "problem": "Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?\n",

If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - There are 30 shiny prop coins.\n   - Each coin is worth $1,000.\n   - Coins are hidden in three different prize boxes.\n   - One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n   - One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.\n   - Bob must submit three guesses, one for each box.\n   - Bob earns no coins if his guess exceeds the number of coins in the box.\n   - Bob wins as many coins as his guess if his guess is equal to or less than the number in the box.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - None indicated in the request. The problem is self-contained and does not specify any external sources for lookup.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The optimal strategy for Bob to maximize his winnings.\n   - The specific distribution of coins into the three boxes that satisfies the conditions.\n   - The minimum amount of money Bob can guarantee to win using his optimal strategy.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The problem likely involves a distribution pattern of the coins among the boxes that maximizes the probability of Bobâ€™s correct guesses. \n   - There might be a game theory or combinatorial approach to determine the optimal guessing strategy.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Analyze the constraints and conditions given in the problem to determine possible distributions of coins among the three boxes.\n- Formulate the potential distributions into a logical framework that can be evaluated programmatically.\n- Use Python to simulate or calculate possible distributions and outcomes based on Bob's optimal guessing strategy.\n- Determine the minimum number of coins Bob can guarantee to win, regardless of the distribution set by the host.\n- Implement the solution using the ComputerTerminal to execute any necessary calculations or simulations.\n- Evaluate the results and ensure they meet the conditions and constraints set by the problem."
