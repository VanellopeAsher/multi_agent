Order the list by the order in which the fractions appear.\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename '9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves accessing and analyzing an image with the filename '9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png'.\n   - The task is to identify all the fractions in the image using '/' as the fraction line and provide answers to any sample problems.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific appearance and content of the image '9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png', including locating and accessing it in the current working directory.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Identification of fractions within the image that use '/' as the fraction line.\n   - Order of the fractions as they appear in the image.\n   - Solutions to any sample problems present within the image.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - None are directly applicable without viewing the content of the image, as this heavily relies on visual input which I cannot access.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- FileSurfer should locate the image named '9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png' in the current working directory to verify its existence and accessibility.\n- FileSurfer should open or analyze the image to extract any fractions using '/' as the fraction line and identify any sample math problems present.\n- Assistant should process the extracted content to format the fractions in a comma-separated list with no whitespace, ensuring they are ordered as they appear in the image.\n- Assistant should calculate the solutions to the sample math problems, if any are present, and include these solutions in the final output as required."

Basically, just working with numbers.\nThis SHOULD be a level familiar with you. If you are not familiar with arithmetic math/rules, then PLEASE review through Arithmetic, as you won't survive even the 1st step of Algebra. Trust me, the basics are THAT important.\nFractions [edit | edit source]\nFractions (from Latin fractus, \"broken\") are parts of a whole. In the image of a cake, there is only 3/4's of the cake showing, the other 1/4 has been eaten/taken away.\nis known as a denominator (Denominator: Number showing the all time total)\nSimplest form/reduced form\nA reduced form of a fraction is a fraction that cannot be divided by any number other than 1, and the denominator is greater than 1. So 2/4 is NOT in simplest form, since we can divide 2\nand 4, by 2... which results in the following number: 1/2. Though, not every fraction can be divided by 2, there are fractions, such as: 5/35, 7/21. and 30/5. The two first fractions are not\ndivisible by 2, and 30/5 can not be divided by 2 on both sides, but only on 30. It's important to simplify as if you were in a test, your teacher will mark your problems as incorrect if you didn't\nsimplify your fractions. t's also important to note that a simplified fraction and the non-simplified fraction (that, if simplified, equals that fraction) are the same, and represent the same\nquantity. So, 2 and 3 represents the same quantity, a halt!\nThe number, 3, in 3/4, is what is known as a numerator (Numerator: Number at the top, tells us of how much of the number is being talked about/being used). The number, 4, in 3/4, is what\n12 (multiplication) =\nACake with fractions a\nHere, we will present a few fractions for you to simplify.\n‘Sample problems for simplifying fractions (use /as the fraction line) [edit | edit source ]\nao |\n“s-C_"
