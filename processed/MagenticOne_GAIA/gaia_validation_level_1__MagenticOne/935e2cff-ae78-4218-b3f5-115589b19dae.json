      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn the year 2022, and before December, what does \"R\" stand for in the three core policies of the type of content that was violated in the public logs on the Legume Wikipedia page?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves an event or policy violation in 2022 before December.\n- The request pertains to the Legume Wikipedia page.\n- The violation relates to the three core policies, with \"R\" as one of the policy components.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific Wikipedia policy components for content violations, which are typically found on Wikipedia's policy or help pages. More specifically, the term beginning with \"R\" in the context of Wikipedia's core content policies.\n- The public logs related to the Legume Wikipedia page to verify the type of content violation that occurred.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Identify which of the Wikipedia core policies correspond to a term that starts with \"R.\"\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- One possible educated guess is that \"R\" could stand for \"Reliability,\" referring to Wikipedia’s core content guideline of ensuring sources are reliable.\n- Another possibility is \"Relevance,\" which could relate to ensuring the content is pertinent to the page.\n- \"Neutral Point of View (NPOV),\" \"Verifiability,\" and \"No original research\" are the three core content policies on Wikipedia, with the potential for \"R\" being related to some derivative of these principles.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Step 1:** Instruct WebSurfer to look up Wikipedia's core content policies to determine the specific policy that starts with \"R\" related to content violations.\n- **Step 2:** Have WebSurfer search for historical content violations on the Legume Wikipedia page, if available online, to verify the type of content violation that occurred before December 2022.\n- **Step 3:** Cross-reference the information obtained on Wikipedia's core policies and the specific violation on the Legume page to identify what \"R\" stands for in the context of the request."

Logged actions include page deletions and restorations, page moves (renames), user blocks and unblocks, page protections and unprotections, user account creations, abuse filter reports, and others. \nLogs can list actions done \nby a user (or IP editor), actions done \nto a user (or IP editor), and actions done \nto a wiki page. \nViewing logs[edit]To view Wikipedia's logs, go to \nSpecial:Log. From there you can decide which actions you wish to see logged, and filter by certain other parameters, such as date and time, user and affected page. When a log type is selected and you click \"Show\", the top of the page describes the log. You can also go directly to a selected log with a search term or link like \nSpecial:Log/block, which displays the block log. Other parameters that can be used in a similar way include \ndelete, \nmove, \nprotect, \nrights, \nupload and \npatrol. \nA link to the log of actions relating to a particular page can be found on the \"View logs for this page\" link on the \"\nView history\" tab at top of the page. A link to the log of actions by a particular user can be found on the left-hand side when the user's talk page or user page is opened. Remember, however, that these are actions \nperformed by that user; for actions affecting a given user (such as blocks), the username (preceded by \"User:\") must be entered in the \"Title\" field of the log page, not the \"User\" field. (This configuration can be accessed directly from the \"View history\" tab of the user's userpage.) \nUsing a log[edit]\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.21\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Help:Log - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn the year 2022, and before December, what does \"R\" stand for in the three core policies of the type of content that was violated in the public logs on the Legume Wikipedia page?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n**Updated Fact Sheet:**\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request involves an event or policy violation in 2022 before December.\n   - The request pertains to the Legume Wikipedia page.\n   - The violation relates to the three core policies of Wikipedia, specifically with \"R\" as one of the policy components.\n   - Wikipedia's known core content policies are \"Neutral Point of View (NPOV),\" \"Verifiability,\" and \"No Original Research.\"\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Any term beginning with \"R\" related to Wikipedia's core content policies, possibly mentioned in discussions or archives.\n   - The detailed logs related to the Legume Wikipedia page to confirm the type of content violation before December 2022.\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which key concept or policy associated with content violations on Wikipedia might start with \"R.\"\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - \"Reliability\": This term aligns with the idea of ensuring content is based on trustworthy sources, which is a fundamental concept in Wikipedia's guidelines.\n   - \"Relevance\": Could be another guess addressing the significance and pertinence of content to the subject matter.\n   - Considering possible derivative or related principles from \"Neutral Point of View,\" \"Verifiability,\" and \"No Original Research\" that might begin with \"R.\"\n   - \"Revision deletion\": Possible technical logs related to removing problematic content for policy reasons, though not one of the listed core content policies.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\nThe primary issue was not finding a direct reference or terminology starting with \"R\" related to Wikipedia's core policies. The focus was too broad and lacked specific targeting within the content policies.\n**New Plan:**\n1. **Focus Search Strategy:**\n   - Target Wikipedia's policy and discussion pages specifically, using the site's internal search to deepen the focus on discussions around \"R\" terms related to content policies.\n2. **Use Wikipedia Directly:**\n   - WebSurfer will directly investigate any talk page archives or policy discussions on Wikipedia, focusing on possible terms or mentions in content policies or related logs.\n3. **Explore Broader Policy Pages:**\n   - Investigate additional Wikipedia pages that might list all policies, guidelines, including less prominent or less cited ones that might include \"R.\"\n4. **Narrow Down Logs:**\n   - Explicitly look at historical logs with pinpointed date filters targeting 2022 on the Legume page to confirm/vindicate potential policy violation entries.\n5. **Seek Community Input:**\n   - If available, look for user discussion forums or user-driven help pages on Wikipedia where \"R\" policy violations or related issues are discussed.\n6. **Derive from Related Concepts:**\n   - Brainstorm with the team any derived terms starting with \"R\" from the core policies that might have been used in past discussions or policies."

Editors should familiarize themselves with all three, jointly interpreted: \nNeutral point of view (\nWP:NPOV) – All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a \nneutral point of view, representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.\nVerifiability (\nWP:V) – Material challenged or \nlikely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source. In Wikipedia, verifiability means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that information comes from a \nreliable source.\nNo original research (\nWP:NOR) – Wikipedia does \nnot publish original thought: all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a \nreliable, published source. Articles may not contain any new analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position not clearly advanced by the sources.\nThese policies determine the type and \nquality of material that is acceptable in Wikipedia articles. Because they complement each other, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another. \nThe principles upon which these policy statements are based are not superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n**Updated Fact Sheet:**\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request involves an event or policy violation in 2022 before December.\n   - The request pertains to the Legume Wikipedia page.\n   - The violation relates to the three core policies of Wikipedia.\n   - Wikipedia's known core content policies are \"Neutral Point of View (NPOV),\" \"Verifiability,\" and \"No Original Research.\"\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific terms or policies beginning with \"R\" related to Wikipedia's core content guidelines.\n   - The detailed revision history of the Legume Wikipedia page to confirm any violations in 2022.\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify any additional Wikipedia policies or guidelines associated with content handling that start with \"R.\"\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Reliability**: Aligns with ensuring content is based on trustworthy sources, a key component of verifiability.\n   - **Relevance**: Addresses the significance and pertinence of content to the subject matter.\n   - **Review**: Possible guess related to the process of checking content quality and adherence to Wikipedia policies.\n   - **Reversion**: Could relate to the practice of undoing edits that violate policies, though more procedural than policy-driven. \nThese new educated guesses consider potential procedural policies or common terms that start with \"R\" and are related to content management on Wikipedia.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\n- The search was too broad without pinpointing specific entries or logs related to the Legume Wikipedia page.\n- Failure to locate a policy or term starting with 'R' in the context of the known core content policies.\n- Lack of direct inspection of more specific elements like talk pages or focused archives of policy discussions.\n**New Plan:**\n1. **Pinpoint Revision History:**\n   - WebSurfer should access the Legume Wikipedia page's revision history. Focus on entries from 2022, checking for any mentions of content policy issues.\n2. **Search Talk Pages:**\n   - Investigate the talk pages associated with the Legume Wikipedia article. Look for discussions, especially those mentioning any policy starting with 'R'.\n3. **Deeper Dive into Policy Archives:**\n   - Explore Wikipedia's content policy pages for any less-known policies or discussions that may include terms starting with 'R'. \n4. **Policy Terms Verification:**\n   - Verify if \"Reliability\" or \"Relevance\" have been referenced as sub-guidelines related to core content policies in any archived discussions or policy notes.\n5. **Log Patterns:**\n   - Analyze change patterns or repeated issues in the revision history that indicate broader policy enforcement or terms.\n6. **Refinement of Search Strategies:**\n   - Utilize more refined search phrases directly in the Wikipedia search bar for effective digging into older discussions and archives. \nBy focusing more precisely on the article's history and related discussions, we can better identify the issue and association with any term or concept starting with 'R'."

Some of the fixed nitrogen becomes available to later crops, so legumes play a key role in \ncrop rotation. \nTerminology[edit]See also: \nBean § TerminologyThe term \npulse, as used by the United Nations' \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is reserved for legume crops harvested solely for the dry seed.\n[1] This excludes \ngreen beans and\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Legume\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q145909\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q145909\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2003-08-26T22:35:36Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-03-14T11:25:51Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Various_legumes.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"plant in the family Fabaceae\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.21\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Various_legumes.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"957\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Legume - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
