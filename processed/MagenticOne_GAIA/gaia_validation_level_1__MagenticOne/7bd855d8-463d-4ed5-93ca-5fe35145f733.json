What were the total sales that the chain made from food (not including drinks)? Express your answer in USD with two decimal places.\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename '7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves analyzing sales data from a local fast-food chain.\n   - The focus is on calculating total sales from food, excluding drinks.\n   - The data is contained in an Excel file named '7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx'.\n   - The answer should be expressed in USD with two decimal places.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - None specified in the request.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The total sales of food items (excluding drinks) from the provided Excel file. This will likely involve summing up relevant entries after identifying which items are categorized as food.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The Excel file likely contains columns that specify whether an item is food or a drink, along with corresponding sales figures.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- FileSurfer will first open and inspect the Excel file '7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx' to understand its structure, including identifying columns that categorize items as food or drinks and their corresponding sales figures.\n- Assistant will outline the necessary Python code to calculate the total sales of food items, based on the structure and content of the Excel file as reported by FileSurfer.\n- ComputerTerminal will execute the Python calculation script to compute the total sales from food.\n- Assistant will take the result and prepare the final total sales in USD with two decimal places."
