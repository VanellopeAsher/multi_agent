You can use the latest 2022 version of english wikipedia.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- There are no specific facts or figures given in the request about the number of studio albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific number and titles of studio albums released by Mercedes Sosa between the years 2000 and 2009. According to the request, this information might be found on the English Wikipedia, specifically the article about Mercedes Sosa.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Once the list of albums is found, it may be necessary to determine which ones qualify as \"studio albums\" as opposed to live albums, compilations, or other types of releases.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on general knowledge, Mercedes Sosa was a prolific singer known for her contributions to Latin American folk music, but without specific data, it is hard to guess the exact number of studio albums she released in that timeframe.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Assign WebSurfer to access the latest 2022 version of the English Wikipedia page for Mercedes Sosa.\n- WebSurfer should search for and identify a list of all studio albums released by Mercedes Sosa, specifically between the years 2000 and 2009.\n- Once WebSurfer has gathered this information, request WebSurfer to provide the exact number of studio albums released in that time frame.\n- Compile the findings and confirm the total number of studio albums released by Mercedes Sosa between 2000 and 2009."

With her roots in \nArgentine folk music, Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of \nEl nuevo cancionero. She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the \"voice of the voiceless ones\".\n[2] She was often called \"the conscience of Latin America\".\n[3]Sosa performed in venues such as the \nLincoln Center in New York City, the \nThéâtre Mogador in Paris, the \nSistine Chapel in Vatican City, as well as sold-out shows in New York's \nCarnegie Hall and the Roman \nColosseum during her final decade of life. Her career spanned four decades and she was the recipient of six \nLatin Grammy awards (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011), including a \nLatin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 and two posthumous \nLatin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2009 and 2011. She won the \nPremio Gardel in 2000, the main musical award in Argentina. She served as an ambassador for \nUNICEF. \nLife[edit]Sosa was born on 9 July 1935, in \nSan Miguel de Tucumán, in the \nnorthwestern Argentine province of \nTucumán, of \nmestizo ancestry. She was of French, Spanish and \nDiaguita descent.\n[4] Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage.\n[5] Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman,\n[6] were \nPeronists, although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the \nPeronist Party in \nTucuman under the name Gladys Osorio.\n[7] In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months.\n[8] She recorded her first album, \nLa Voz de la Zafra, in 1959.\n[8] A performance at the 1965 \nCosquín National Folklore Festival—where she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer \nJorge Cafrune—\n[9] brought her to the attention of the Argentine public.\n[8] Sosa and her first husband, \nManuel Oscar Matus, with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s \nnueva canción movement (which was called \nnuevo cancionero in Argentina).\n[10] Her second record was \nCanciones con Fundamento, a collection of Argentine folk songs. \nSosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries.\n[11]In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success.\n[citation needed] In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America. \nIn the early 1970s, Sosa released two concept albums in collaboration with composer \nAriel Ramírez\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

She also recorded a tribute to Chilean musician \nVioleta Parra in 1971, including what was to become one of Sosa's signature songs, \nGracias a la vida.\n[4][12] She further popularized of songs written by \nMilton Nascimento of Brazil and \nPablo Milanés and \nSilvio Rodríguez both from \nCuba.\n[4] Throughout the decade, she released albums such as \nHasta la Victoria in 1972 and \nTraigo un Pueblo \nen mi Voz in 1973. They featured songs like \"Cuando tenga la tierra\", written by \nAriel Petrocelli and Daniel Toro, which tackles political and social issues like wealth and land inequality.\n[13][14] During the 1970s she was a part of two films by the director \nLeopoldo Torre Nilsson: \nEl Santo de la Espada in 1970 and \nGüemes, la tierra en armas in 1971, in which she portrayed \nJuana Azurduy de Padilla, the guerrilla military leader who fought for Argentine independence.\n[13][15]Sosa in 1972\nAfter the \nmilitary junta of \nJorge Videla came to power in 1976, the atmosphere in Argentina grew increasingly oppressive. Sosa faced death threats against both her and her family, but refused for many years to leave the country. At a concert in \nLa Plata in 1979, Sosa was searched and arrested on stage, along with all those attending the concert.\n[10] Their release came about through international intervention.\n[8] Despite attempts to hold more concerts, she was officially barred from performing by the military regime.\n[5] Banned in her own country, she moved to Paris and then to \nMadrid.\n[8][10]She has spoken publicly about her artistic and emotional struggles during this period of her life.\n[5] While in exile, she released the album \nA Quien Doy in 1981. The album included a recording of the song \"Cuando Me Acuerdo de Mi Pais\" which was originally written by the prolific Chilean singer/songwriter, \nPatricio Manns. The song, which he wrote while also in political exile, expresses the sorrow he felt from being separated from his homeland.\n[16] She related to this feeling and struggled to continue recording and performing. In an interview with the New York Times, she said, “It was a mental problem, a problem of morale...It wasn’t my throat, or anything physical\". \n[5]Sosa returned to Argentina from her exile in Europe in February of 1982,\n[17][10] several months before the military regime collapsed as a result of the \nFalklands War, and gave a series of concerts at the \nTeatro Ópera in Buenos Aires, where she invited many of her younger colleagues to share the stage. A double album of recordings from these performances became an instant best seller. She then traveled to perform in her home province of Tucuman. However, these performances were largely ignored by mainstream media in the country.\n[17] In subsequent years, Sosa continued to tour both in Argentina and abroad, performing in such venues as the \nLincoln Center in New York City and the \nThéâtre Mogador in Paris. In poor health for much of the 1990s, she performed a comeback show in Argentina in 1998.\n[8] In 1994, she played in the \nSistine Chapel in Vatican City.\n[4] In 2002, she sold out both \nCarnegie Hall in New York and the \nColosseum in Rome in the same year.\n[4]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
