My friend from class sent me an audio recording of Professor Willowbrook giving out the recommended reading for the test, but my headphones are broken :(\nCould you please listen to the recording for me and tell me the page numbers I'm supposed to go over? I've attached a file called Homework.mp3 that has the recording. Please provide just the page numbers as a comma-delimited list. And please provide the list in ascending order.\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename '1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - A recording file titled '1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3' is mentioned.\n   - The recording is from a class in which Professor Willowbrook provides recommended reading for a Calculus mid-term.\n   - The page numbers from the recommended reading need to be provided in a comma-delimited list, in ascending order.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - None specified.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The content of the audio file needs to be interpreted to extract the page numbers.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - \"Professor Willowbrook\" seems to be an instructor's name, potentially fictional or specific to a particular educational institution or context.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **File Handling**: Utilize FileSurfer to access and examine the contents of the file named '1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3' from the current working directory.\n- **Audio Processing**: If the file format and content are confirmed to be an audio recording, extract the audio to obtain textual data.\n- **Text Interpretation**: Parse the extracted text to identify and isolate the page numbers mentioned by Professor Willowbrook.\n- **Data Formatting**: Arrange the identified page numbers in a comma-delimited list, ensuring they are in ascending order.\n- **Delivery**: Present the organized list of page numbers as the final output."
