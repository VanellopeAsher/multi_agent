Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request concerns a Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur.\n   - The article was promoted in November 2016.\n   - The task is to identify who nominated this article.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The list of Featured Articles on English Wikipedia, specifically those about dinosaurs.\n   - The Featured Articles promoted in November 2016.\n   - The nomination details for the article in question, including the nominator’s identity.\n   - These details can be found on the English Wikipedia \"Featured Article\" page and through the article’s revision history or talk page.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Cross-referencing the list of dinosaur-related Featured Articles with the articles promoted in November 2016 to find the specific article in question.\n   - Identifying if there is only one such article to ensure it matches the request.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The article may be about a well-known or particularly interesting dinosaur given its status as a Featured Article.\n   - The nominator might be a well-known or active member of the Wikipedia community, possibly with an interest in paleontology or dinosaurs.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**:\n  1. Search for the list of Featured Articles on English Wikipedia, specifically targeting dinosaur-related articles.\n  2. Identify the Featured Articles promoted in November 2016 and cross-reference these with dinosaur-related articles.\n  3. Find the nominator information for the article promoted in November 2016.\n- **Assistant**:\n  - Coordinate information gathering and ensure the correct cross-referencing of data found by WebSurfer. \nWith this plan, WebSurfer will be the primary agent to gather the necessary information online, while the Assistant will ensure all information is accurately processed and aligned to address the request effectively."

Perform a targeted search for \"Wikipedia Featured Articles promoted November 2016\" and focus on finding a direct link to the main Wikipedia page listing these.\n  2. Once on the correct Wikipedia page, identify articles from November 2016, focusing on those about dinosaurs.\n  3. Check the talk page or Featured Article nomination page for the article to identify the nominator.\n- **Additional Steps**:\n  - Ensure pages like \"Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/November 2016\" are accessed, as they may contain nomination details.\n  - Address any prompts about cookies or preferences immediately to ensure smooth access to content.\nThis plan aims to improve search precision and ensure access to the necessary pages for verification and detail extraction."

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nLet's update the fact sheet with what we have learned:\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request concerns a Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur.\n   - The article was promoted in November 2016.\n   - The task is to identify who nominated this article.\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific page to check is \"Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/November 2016\" for a dinosaur article.\n   - The nomination details, including the nominator’s identity.\n   - Cross-referencing the list of dinosaur-related Featured Articles promoted in 2016.\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify any dinosaur-related article from the list in \"Featured article candidates/Featured log/November 2016.\"\n   - Confirm that this is the only dinosaur-related article promoted in that month.\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The article might highlight a unique or significant dinosaur, explaining its promotion to Featured status in that period.\n   - The nominator is likely involved with the WikiProject Dinosaurs, which often sees nominations from editors with specialized interest in this topic.\n   - Given challenges in navigation, accessing specific archived discussions for the nomination may help identify the nominator.\nThese updates aim to focus on narrowing down the specific page and checking nomination details directly.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\n- **Root Cause**: WebSurfer encountered navigation issues and did not reach the specific Wikipedia page “Featured article candidates/Featured log/November 2016.”\n- **Challenge**: The cookie consent prompt and incorrect links may have distracted from accessing the correct content.\n### New Plan\n- **Assistant**:\n  - Specify exact search terms and page titles to target.\n  - Guide WebSurfer to disable or quickly accept cookies to facilitate smoother navigation.\n- **WebSurfer**:\n  1. **Search for “Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/November 2016”** and directly access this link.\n  2. **Accept or dismiss any cookies consent prompt immediately** to avoid distractions.\n  3. Once on the correct page, scan the list for any dinosaur-related articles.\n  4. Click on the relevant article link to access its nomination or talk page and identify the nominator.\n- **Additional Steps**:\n  - Ensure focus remains on Wikipedia links, avoiding external sites or incorrect pages.\n  - Validate information by cross-referencing with “Wikipedia:Featured articles promoted in 2016.”\nThis plan emphasizes direct targeting of required pages and handling cookies promptly for efficient navigation."

Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the article's talk page or in Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates. No further edits should be made to this page.The article was \npromoted by \nIan Rose via \nFACBot (\ntalk) 22:26, 30 November 2016 \n[1]. \nAfter the Deluge (painting)[edit]Nominator(s): ‑ Iridescent 10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"Bright rising sun illuminating the clouds over a featureless horizon\" has become such a staple image since the advent of modern photography, it's easy to forget that it had to begin somewhere. Likewise, if \nGeorge Frederic Watts is remembered at all nowadays it's as the painter of formal portraits of dignitaries and of earnestly portentious paintings with titles like \nLove and Death and \nThe Slumber of the Ages, not as the painter of dramatic landscapes. \nAfter the Deluge is an explicitly religious painting, yet contains no religious imagery of any kind, and is an interesting snapshot of the transition between 19th-century symbolism and 20th-century abstraction. Because this has spent the last century in the backwater of \nCompton rather than in a high-profile institution like the Tate Gallery or the Yale Center for British Art, there hasn't been all that much written about this particular piece so the article is shorter than usual, but I believe this collates together everything significant that there is to say about it. \nAnd yes, I know it looks like I've accidentally cut-and-pasted a chunk of body text into the wikilink but Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis genuinely is the name of Turner's painting of the same subject. ‑ \nIridescent \n10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]Comments by Lingzhi[edit]I'm wondering whether the \"A transcendent power of light...\" quote would be more appropriate for the \"Subject\" section... \nLingzhi ♦ \n(talk) \n11:31, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.21\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/November 2016 - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the article's talk page or in Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates. No further edits should be made to this page.The article was \npromoted by \nIan Rose via \nFACBot (\ntalk) 22:26, 30 November 2016 \n[1]. \nAfter the Deluge (painting)[edit]Nominator(s): ‑ Iridescent 10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"Bright rising sun illuminating the clouds over a featureless horizon\" has become such a staple image since the advent of modern photography, it's easy to forget that it had to begin somewhere. Likewise, if \nGeorge Frederic Watts is remembered at all nowadays it's as the painter of formal portraits of dignitaries and of earnestly portentious paintings with titles like \nLove and Death and \nThe Slumber of the Ages, not as the painter of dramatic landscapes. \nAfter the Deluge is an explicitly religious painting, yet contains no religious imagery of any kind, and is an interesting snapshot of the transition between 19th-century symbolism and 20th-century abstraction. Because this has spent the last century in the backwater of \nCompton rather than in a high-profile institution like the Tate Gallery or the Yale Center for British Art, there hasn't been all that much written about this particular piece so the article is shorter than usual, but I believe this collates together everything significant that there is to say about it. \nAnd yes, I know it looks like I've accidentally cut-and-pasted a chunk of body text into the wikilink but Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis genuinely is the name of Turner's painting of the same subject. ‑ \nIridescent \n10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]Comments by Lingzhi[edit]I'm wondering whether the \"A transcendent power of light...\" quote would be more appropriate for the \"Subject\" section... \nLingzhi ♦ \n(talk) \n11:31, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.21\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/November 2016 - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

I've no particular attachment to keeping it in any given place, although I feel it makes more sense in the section on exhibition, as it illustrates that Watts was anticipating that his audience wouldn't necessarily get the point if he didn't explain it. ‑ \nIridescent \n11:46, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]Comments by Wehwalt[edit]I've got a flight in the morning so forgive me if this is a bit piecemeal: \nWhy is \"flood\" lower case when appended to \"Noah's\" but capped otherwise?\nBecause I'm sloppy, now standardized on the capitalized form when talking about the specific Biblical event. ‑ \nIridescent \n17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"he explicitly aimed at evoking\" this seems too wordy. What's wrong with \"he intended to evoke\"\nI've amended it in the lead, but I think the \"explicitly\" ought to remain in the body. Basically, Watts (along with virtually everyone else at this time) was part of the fad for painting classical subjects and often dabbled with Greek and Roman gods (and with more abstract Christian concepts like the personifications of Faith, Hope and Charity), but with this particular painting he wanted viewers to get the impression of a single all-powerful God showing off what he could do, even though a viewer could equally reasonably interpret it as a trial of strength between a sun-god and a water-god. ‑ \nIridescent \n17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"Watts worked on the painting for a further five years, and the completed version was eventually exhibited at the New Gallery in 1891.\" \"eventually\" seems surplasage.\nI've reworded it to \"the completed version was exhibited for the first time [in 1891]\"; I agree that \"eventually\" isn't appropriate, but I want to communicate that after its first exhibition he withdrew it and didn't show it again until it had reached its final state. (I'm assuming a lot of the traffic to this will be coming from the much better known \nHope, where Watts painted multiple versions and sold off or gave away the preliminary versions, so some readers will reasonably assume that was his usual way of working.) ‑ \nIridescent \n17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"around the country\" I'd let this pass if there had been any geographical hint in text beyond that of Whitechapel, so I'd be more specific.\nAmended to \"around the United Kingdom\" in the lead—in the body text \"Cork, Edinburgh, Manchester, Dublin and London\" is spelled out so I think the \"around the country\" can stay. ‑ \nIridescent \n17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

Why not say he was elected to the Royal Academy? Then you can say he became disillusioned with \"its culture\"?\nYes, that works, done. ‑ \nIridescent \n08:10, 15 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"Although his father's strict evangelical Christianity had instilled in Watts a strong dislike of organised religion since his childhood,\" I would strike the last three words If it comes from the father, it's most likely a childhood influence.\nYes, fair enough ‑ \nIridescent \n08:10, 15 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"showed Noah sacrificing to the sun in thanks for his family's salvation from the floodwaters\" I would strike the last three words. Even if perchance someone is unfamiliar with the story of Noah coming in, by this time they have the general idea.\nI was thinking that there was potential for readers misunderstanding \"salvation\" as being the point at which Noah decided he was going to follow God's will, rather than the moment at which God physically rescued him, given the common use of the term in both Judaism and Christianity as a synonym for \"redemption\". I agree that it's not really necessary, since anyone reading this is presumably going to know that the Sacrifice of Noah refers to the specific event after the flood was over. ‑ \nIridescent \n08:10, 15 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]Regarding \"Mr. Watts\" and \"St. Jude\", are the periods as intended? I understand the British practice is often to omit them. Regarding Mr. Watts, I note that the first usage of this in the article is rendered without the dot on the Tate website, \nhere.\nThe MOS says to always use the period in US and Canadian English, and that either form is acceptable in British English. Since this is unquestionably a BrEng topic, I've removed the periods, which shaves off a few extra characters. ‑ \nIridescent \n08:10, 15 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"for his exhibitions.[23][E] Following this exhibition\" I would be less of an exhibitionist.\nChanged one of them to \"regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents\" to avoid the repetition. ‑ \nIridescent \n08:10, 15 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"in the two decades following its exhibition\" that is, following 1886 or 1891?\nThe 1891 exhibition—prior to that, nobody really knew it existed. I've changed \"exhibition\" to \"completion\". (It will technically be the 23 years following its completion—the outbreak of WW1 functioned as a huge reset button for Western art and culture—but this article's so short that I don't want to get into a long aside about the emergence of surrealism.) ‑\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the article's talk page or in Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates. No further edits should be made to this page.The article was \npromoted by \nIan Rose via \nFACBot (\ntalk) 22:26, 30 November 2016 \n[1]. \nAfter the Deluge (painting)[edit]Nominator(s): ‑ Iridescent 10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"Bright rising sun illuminating the clouds over a featureless horizon\" has become such a staple image since the advent of modern photography, it's easy to forget that it had to begin somewhere. Likewise, if \nGeorge Frederic Watts is remembered at all nowadays it's as the painter of formal portraits of dignitaries and of earnestly portentious paintings with titles like \nLove and Death and \nThe Slumber of the Ages, not as the painter of dramatic landscapes. \nAfter the Deluge is an explicitly religious painting, yet contains no religious imagery of any kind, and is an interesting snapshot of the transition between 19th-century symbolism and 20th-century abstraction. Because this has spent the last century in the backwater of \nCompton rather than in a high-profile institution like the Tate Gallery or the Yale Center for British Art, there hasn't been all that much written about this particular piece so the article is shorter than usual, but I believe this collates together everything significant that there is to say about it. \nAnd yes, I know it looks like I've accidentally cut-and-pasted a chunk of body text into the wikilink but Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis genuinely is the name of Turner's painting of the same subject. ‑ \nIridescent \n10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]Comments by Lingzhi[edit]I'm wondering whether the \"A transcendent power of light...\" quote would be more appropriate for the \"Subject\" section... \nLingzhi ♦ \n(talk) \n11:31, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.21\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/November 2016 - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

I've no particular attachment to keeping it in any given place, although I feel it makes more sense in the section on exhibition, as it illustrates that Watts was anticipating that his audience wouldn't necessarily get the point if he didn't explain it. ‑ \nIridescent \n11:46, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]Comments by Wehwalt[edit]I've got a flight in the morning so forgive me if this is a bit piecemeal: \nWhy is \"flood\" lower case when appended to \"Noah's\" but capped otherwise?\nBecause I'm sloppy, now standardized on the capitalized form when talking about the specific Biblical event. ‑ \nIridescent \n17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"he explicitly aimed at evoking\" this seems too wordy. What's wrong with \"he intended to evoke\"\nI've amended it in the lead, but I think the \"explicitly\" ought to remain in the body. Basically, Watts (along with virtually everyone else at this time) was part of the fad for painting classical subjects and often dabbled with Greek and Roman gods (and with more abstract Christian concepts like the personifications of Faith, Hope and Charity), but with this particular painting he wanted viewers to get the impression of a single all-powerful God showing off what he could do, even though a viewer could equally reasonably interpret it as a trial of strength between a sun-god and a water-god. ‑ \nIridescent \n17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"Watts worked on the painting for a further five years, and the completed version was eventually exhibited at the New Gallery in 1891.\" \"eventually\" seems surplasage.\nI've reworded it to \"the completed version was exhibited for the first time [in 1891]\"; I agree that \"eventually\" isn't appropriate, but I want to communicate that after its first exhibition he withdrew it and didn't show it again until it had reached its final state. (I'm assuming a lot of the traffic to this will be coming from the much better known \nHope, where Watts painted multiple versions and sold off or gave away the preliminary versions, so some readers will reasonably assume that was his usual way of working.) ‑ \nIridescent \n17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\"around the country\" I'd let this pass if there had been any geographical hint in text beyond that of Whitechapel, so I'd be more specific.\nAmended to \"around the United Kingdom\" in the lead—in the body text \"Cork, Edinburgh, Manchester, Dublin and London\" is spelled out so I think the \"around the country\" can stay. ‑ \nIridescent \n17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
