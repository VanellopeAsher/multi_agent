Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The percentage change in the proportion of computer scientists that were women is 13%.\n   - The starting percentage of women among computer scientists is 37%.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The duration in years it took for the percentage of women in computer science to change by 13%. This could potentially be found on the Girls Who Code website or related reports and publications by the organization.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The final percentage of women in computer science after the 13% change from a starting point of 37% is 24%.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - A possible time frame might be several decades, as shifts in workforce demographics often take time. However, without specific data, this remains speculative.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Ask WebSurfer to search for information on the Girls Who Code website or other reputable sources regarding the historical data on the percentage of women in computer science and any reports on how long it took for the percentage to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.\n- If the specific time frame is not readily available online, ask WebSurfer to gather general trends or data points related to the participation of women in computer science over time, which might help in making an educated guess.\n- Compile the findings and verify if the time duration is clearly stated or can be inferred from the available data.\n- Summarize the information found to provide an answer to the original request."
