I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - In Tizin, basic sentences are verb-object-subject.\n   - \"Pa\" is the nominative form for oneself, \"Mato\" is the accusative, and \"Sing\" is the genitive.\n   - The root verb \"Maktay\" indicates an intense liking and is used in the present tense. The preterit past is \"Tay,\" and the imperfect past is \"Aktay.\"\n   - \"Apple\" is the nominative form in Tizin for apples, \"Zapple\" is the accusative, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive.\n   - \"Maktay\" is translated as \"is pleasing to,\" meaning the object of the sentence is the one doing the liking.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - None needed as this is a fictional language scenario provided in the request.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - How to structure the sentence \"I like apples\" using the Tizin sentence structure and given words.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - None needed as the request is self-contained with clear instructions.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Use the GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS to determine the correct structure for the Tizin sentence translation of \"I like apples.\"\n- Translate \"I like apples\" into Tizin by applying the verb-object-subject structure alongside the given words.\n- Return the translated sentence to the user."
