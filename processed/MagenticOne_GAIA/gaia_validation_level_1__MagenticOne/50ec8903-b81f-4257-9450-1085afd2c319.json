      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nA standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - A standard Rubik's Cube has 6 sides, each traditionally consisting of a single solid color when solved.\n   - The cube is composed of cubelets: 6 center cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces.\n   - All blue cubes have been found.\n   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube.\n   - All green corner cubes have been found.\n   - All green cubes that border yellow have been found.\n   - For all orange cubes found, the cubes on the opposite face have been found.\n   - The removed cube has two colors on its faces.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific opposite face relationships in a standard Rubik’s Cube (though commonly known, this detail would ensure accuracy).\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which cubes remain unfound based on the given information.\n   - Identify which cube, with two colored faces, is missing based on the positions and colors given.\n   - Deduce which colors remain as possibilities for the removed cube.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Typical opposite face relationships on a standard Rubik's Cube include: white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and orange opposite red.\n   - Possible significance of \"cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube\" might suggest positions on the same face or adjacent ones.\n   - Likely deduced missing colors will include those not fully found or specified in the details given.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Gather Information**: Use WebSurfer to verify the standard color opposite relationships on a Rubik's Cube to ensure accuracy regarding the position and adjacency logic of cube colors.\n- **Analyze Given Information**: Use Assistant to systematically list out and analyze all given and found cubes, identifying which colors have already been accounted for based on the problem statement.\n- **Deduce Missing Cube**: Based on the analysis, derive which edge cube (with two colored faces) is missing by elimination and logical deduction using the constraints provided in the problem.\n- **Verify and Confirm Result**: Confirm the accuracy of the deduction by cross-checking against the standard Rubik's Cube color configuration. Use Assistant to ensure logical consistency in the final deduction."
