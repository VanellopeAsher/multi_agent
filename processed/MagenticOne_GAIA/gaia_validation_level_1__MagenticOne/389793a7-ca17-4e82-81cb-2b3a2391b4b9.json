In the reference file is a layout of the road and nearby houses. Each dash, \"-\", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename '389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - Each dash, \"-\", represents a mile marker.\n   - Each capital \"H\" indicates a house located next to a mile marker.\n   - A cell phone tower can cover houses within a 4-mile radius.\n   - The filename '389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt' is in the current directory and contains the layout of the road and nearby houses.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - There are no explicit facts to look up mentioned in the request.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The specific arrangement of houses and road markers from the given file.\n   - The minimum number of cell phone towers needed based on the arrangement of houses and the coverage radius of 4 miles.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The road likely features multiple stretches and arrangements that need to be analyzed to find optimal tower placement.\n   - There may be clusters of houses that allow for efficient tower placement covering multiple houses.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Read and Analyze the File Layout:**\n  - Use FileSurfer to access and read the content of the file '389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt' to understand the distribution of houses and mile markers.\n- **Identify House Positions:**\n  - Extract the positions of all the houses relative to the mile markers, noting their specific locations.\n- **Determine Optimal Tower Placement:**\n  - Using the data extracted, compute the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to ensure all houses are within a 4-mile radius of at least one tower. This could involve writing a Python script or algorithm.\n- **Verify and Present Results:**\n  - Once the calculations are complete, present the minimum number of towers needed as a positive integer."
