Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request contains a set of logical statements expressed in terms of logical equivalences.\n- The logical statements involve variables A and B and various logical operations such as conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨), negation (¬), and implication (→).\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- There are no external facts that need to be looked up as all necessary information revolves around logic and equivalences which can be derived or recalled from principles of logic.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determine the truth conditions and equivalence relationships of each logical statement.\n- Identify any discrepancies among the provided equivalences to find the statement that does not fit with the others.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Recall from logic: \n  - De Morgan's Laws: ¬(A ∧ B) is equivalent to (¬A ∨ ¬B) and ¬(A ∨ B) is equivalent to (¬A ∧ ¬B).\n  - Implication equivalences: (A → B) is equivalent to (¬A ∨ B) and its contrapositive (¬B → ¬A).\n  - Implication negation: ¬(A → B) is equivalent to (A ∧ ¬B).\n  - Based on these laws and equivalences, determine which statement might not fit with the rest in the context of logical equivalence.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\nHere's a plan to address the request using the team members:\n- Analysis with Assistant:\n  - Use logical reasoning and recall of logical equivalences to analyze the given statements and identify which one does not logically fit with the others.\n- Verification with Python (ComputerTerminal):\n  - Write a Python script to compute truth tables for each logical statement.\n  - Cross-check the output to verify the logical equivalence of each statement to ensure accuracy in identifying the outlier.\n- No need for WebSurfer or FileSurfer:\n  - This task doesn't require accessing web pages or handling local files, as all necessary logic processing can be done in-house through reasoning and Python script execution.\nBy leveraging the logical understanding and computational power of Assistant and ComputerTerminal, the task can be efficiently tackled."

      "content": "To determine which statement isn't logically equivalent to the others, we need to recall and analyze logical equivalences. Let's evaluate each given equivalence based on known logical laws:\n1. **¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B):** This is De Morgan's Law, which states that the negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of negations.\n2. **¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B):** This is also De Morgan's Law, which states that the negation of a disjunction is equivalent to the conjunction of negations.\n3. **(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A):** This is the contrapositive law, where an implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.\n4. **(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B):** This is a standard equivalence for implication, where (A → B) is rewritten using disjunction.\n5. **(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B):** This is another version of the implication equivalence, where (¬A → B) can be rewritten in terms of disjunction.\n6. **¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B):** This is the negation of an implication, which states that the negation of (A → B) is equivalent to (A ∧ ¬B).\nNow, let's verify each statement based on common logical rules:\n- Statements 1 and 2 are solidly based on De Morgan's Laws.\n- Statements 3 and 4 are based on implication equivalences with their conversions to disjunctions.\n- Statement 6 deals with the negation of an implication, which fits a common logical rule.\nThe statement to pay particular attention to is:\n**5. (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)**\nThis statement suggests an equivalence that does not directly follow standard logical rules for implication. Specifically, the left side of the statement (¬A → B) can be understood as (A ∨ B) by rewriting it using implication equivalence (¬A implies B means A or B must be true), which directly contradicts (A ∨ ¬B).\nThus, **statement 5** does not logically fit with the rest. This statement incorrectly interprets the negation or implication equivalence laws and does not match the pattern of standard logical equivalences."
