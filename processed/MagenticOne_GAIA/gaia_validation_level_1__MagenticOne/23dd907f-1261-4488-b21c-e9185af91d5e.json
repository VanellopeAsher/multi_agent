      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn Audre Lorde’s poem “Father Son and Holy Ghost”, what is the number of the stanza in which some lines are indented?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves Audre Lorde’s poem “Father Son and Holy Ghost.”\n   - The request asks for the number of the stanza with indented lines.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The structure of the poem “Father Son and Holy Ghost” by Audre Lorde, specifically identifying which stanza has indented lines. This would be found in the text of the poem itself.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None directly derivable from the request without additional information.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - None, as the question is specific to the poem's content and structure, which requires either knowledge of the poem or access to its text.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for and find the full text of Audre Lorde’s poem “Father Son and Holy Ghost.” \n- **Step 2:** Have WebSurfer or FileSurfer verify the stanza structure of the poem, identifying which stanza contains indented lines.\n- **Step 3:** Report back with the stanza number that includes indented lines, addressing the original request."
