It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* for short).\nThese bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were \nthe first to observe these wispy trails. Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nMeerKAT image of the galactic center with color-coded position angles of the vertical filaments.

Courtesy Farhad Yusef-Zadeh/Northwestern University\nWait, There's More!\nRecently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. “It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,” Yusef-Zadeh said. “We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I’m used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.”\nHe and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren’t fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole’s spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.”\nYusef-Zadeh pointed out that something clearly occurred in the core to create the short radial filaments. “We think they must have originated with some kind of outflow from an activity that happened a few million years ago,” he said. “It seems to be the result of an interaction of that outflowing material with objects near it.”\nMeerKAT image of the galactic center with color-coded position angles of the short, radial filaments. Courtesy: Farhad Yusef-Zadeh/Northwestern University\nPinning Down Filament Histories\nLike other supermassive black holes, Sgr A* has been known to swallow up material occasionally. Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nA schematic diagram of the outflow from Sagittarius A* showing the direction of the radial filaments. Courtesy: Farhad Yusef-Zadeh/Northwestern University\nThe vertical ones pose a different challenge to understand. They tower up to 150 light-years above the plane of the galaxy. Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow. That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nDifferent Types of Filaments, Milky-Way Style\nTheir origins likely explain the radically different orientations and characteristics of each filament population. The vertical filaments are perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and stretch up to around 150 light-years in length, while the horizontal ones are parallel to the plane and are only about 5 to 10 light-years long. The horizontals point radially toward the center of the galaxy where Sgr A* lies. The vertical ones are magnetic and relativistic (meaning their particles are moving near the speed of light). The horizontal filaments appear to emit thermal (warm) radiation and seem to be accelerating warmed material in a molecular cloud. There are just a few hundred of these horizontal filaments seen so far.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

There are just a few hundred of these horizontal filaments seen so far.\nThe vertical filaments appear around the nucleus of the galaxy while the horizontal ones spread out to only one side. According to Yusef-Zadeh, the radial outflows are somewhat lopsided. That may give some clues about the black hole region itself. \"One of the most important implications of radial outflow that we have detected is the orientation of the accretion disk and the jet-driven outflow from Sagittarius A* along the galactic plane,\" he said.\nLooking at the Filaments through Time\nWhile the radial filaments Yusef-Zadeh and his team found are a more recent discovery, the vertical ones are old friends. There are nearly a thousand of them grouped in pairs and clusters. Yusef-Zadeh says they are about 6 million years old.\nHe's been studying odd structures in the galactic core for decades. In 1984, he worked with astronomers Mark Morris and Don Chance to make a Very Large Array radio map of the galactic center in the 20-cm wavelength band when they first found the vertical structures. The emissions they detected came from nonthermally emitting (i.e. cool) gas arranged along magnetic structures. \n https://youtu.be/9LzJDpp_Wbo A video about the discovery of the radio bubble emanating from the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Courtesy: Northwestern University.\nLater on, in 2019, Yusef-Zadeh was part of a team led by astronomer Ian Haywood (University of Oxford) that used the MeerKAT radio observatory facility in South Africa to discover two gigantic radio-emitting bubbles near Sgr A*. That huge burst of energetic activity described earlier created those bubbles several million years ago.\nAt the time, the team immediately suspected Sgr A* as a source of the hourglass-shaped structure. “The center of our galaxy is relatively calm when compared to other galaxies with very active central black holes,” said Heywood. “Even so, the Milky Way’s central black hole can—from time to time—become uncharacteristically active, flaring up as it periodically devours massive clumps of dust and gas. It’s possible that one such feeding frenzy triggered powerful outbursts that inflated this previously unseen feature.”\nMeerKAT Scans the Bubbles\nThe discovery of radio bubbles in the galactic core a few years ago highlighted the great capabilities of the\n MeerKAT radio telescope. It's an array of 64 radio dishes sensitive to emissions in the microwave regime, ranging from wavelengths between 3 to 30 centimeters. Yusef-Zadeh credits the facility with helping his team to pinpoint the filaments against a busy background of other emitters. They used a technique to remove the background and smooth the noise from MeerKAT images in order to isolate the filaments from surrounding structures.\n“The new MeerKAT observations have been a game changer,” he said. “The advancement of technology and dedicated observing time have given us new information. It’s really a technical achievement from radio astronomers.”\nFor More Information\nMysterious dashes revealed in Milky Way’s CenterThe Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: Position Angle Distribution Reveals a Degree-scale Collimated Outflow from Sgr A* along the Galactic Plane\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nOn June 6, 2023, an article by Carolyn Collins Petersen was published in Universe Today. This article mentions a team that produced a paper about their observations, linked at the bottom of the article. Find this paper. Under what NASA award number was the work performed by R. G. Arendt supported by?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - An article by Carolyn Collins Petersen titled \"There Are Hundreds of Mysterious Filaments at the Center of the Milky Way\" was published in Universe Today on June 6, 2023.\n   - The article mentions a team that produced a paper about their observations.\n   - R. G. Arendt's work was supported by a NASA award number.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The direct link to the specific paper mentioned in the article. \n   - The NASA award number supporting R. G. Arendt's work, found in the paper's \"Acknowledgments\" or \"Funding\" section.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Identify key terms from the article to locate the paper easily, such as names of the researchers or specific terms related to their discoveries.\n   - Possible sections or keywords within the article that could indicate the presence of the paper link, like \"For More Information,\" \"References,\" or \"Citations.\"\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The NASA award number might be found under a \"Funding\" or \"Acknowledgments\" section of the paper.\n   - We may need to check the bottom of the article for links to external resources or papers.\n   - The link to the paper might be embedded within a phrase such as \"Read the full study\" or \"Learn more in the paper.\"\nThe reasoning for updating the educated guesses includes recognizing common phrasing or placement in articles that often lead to external research papers. This focuses efforts on specific strategies for identifying the direct source swiftly.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### What Went Wrong\nThe main issue was not successfully accessing and navigating to the Universe Today article. There may have been a misunderstanding of the link clicking process or the inability to load the correct page due to browser or link redirection.\n### New Plan\n- **Access Article Correctly:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to ensure the correct link is clicked, and verify that the page opens directly to the article on Universe Today.\n  - Look for visual confirmation on the webpage to ensure it's the correct article by checking the title and author.\n- **Locate Paper Link:**\n  - Scan the article for keywords such as \"Read the full study,\" \"For More Information,\" \"References,\" or \"Citations\" which might indicate where the paper is linked.\n  - Pay special attention to the bottom of the article where such links are commonly placed.\n- **Navigate to Paper:**\n  - Once the link is found, open the paper in a new tab to ensure the original article is not lost.\n  - Confirm the paper is the correct one related to the article's content.\n- **Search for Funding Information:**\n  - Use the browser search function (Ctrl+F) to find sections labeled \"Funding\" or \"Acknowledgments.\"\n  - Specifically search for \"NASA\" or \"R. G. Arendt\" to quickly locate the award number.\n- **Summarize Findings:**\n  - Document the NASA award number found in the funding section of the paper.\n  - Reassure all information is captured accurately from the correct document. \nThis plan focuses on efficiently navigating web pages and ensuring correct information capture, while adapting strategies to avoid redirection or link errors."

The region is densely packed with stars, dominated by red giants.Are radio waves coming from the center of the Galaxy?\nBut we can detect radio waves, and there are some unexplained ones coming from the center of the galaxy, and adding to the mystery. Astronomers have discovered a transient source of radio waves at the Milky Way’s center.\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"SystemEntropyOriginTrialToken\": \"A5is4nwJJVnhaJpUr1URgj4vvAXSiHoK0VBbM9fawMskbDUj9WUREpa3JzGAo6xd1Cp2voQEG1h6NQ71AsMznU8AAABxeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW5nLmNvbTo0NDMiLCJmZWF0dXJlIjoiTXNVc2VyQWdlbnRMYXVuY2hOYXZUeXBlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzUzNzQ3MjAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Grazie alla ricerca intelligente di Bing puoi trovare ci\\u00f2 che cerchi in modo semplice e rapido accumulando punti.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Bing\",\n        \"og:title\": \"There Are Hundreds of Mysterious Filaments at the Center of the Milky Way site:universetoday.com - Bing\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=There+Are+Hundreds+of+Mysterious+Filaments+at+the+Center+of+the+Milky+Way+site%3Auniversetoday.com&FORM=QBLH\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"3732605936979161\",\n        \"og:image\": \"http://www.bing.com/sa/simg/facebook_sharing_5.png\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"600\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"315\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* for short).\nThese bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were \nthe first to observe these wispy trails. Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nMeerKAT image of the galactic center with color-coded position angles of the vertical filaments.

Courtesy Farhad Yusef-Zadeh/Northwestern University\nWait, There's More!\nRecently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. “It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,” Yusef-Zadeh said. “We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I’m used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.”\nHe and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren’t fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole’s spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.”\nYusef-Zadeh pointed out that something clearly occurred in the core to create the short radial filaments. “We think they must have originated with some kind of outflow from an activity that happened a few million years ago,” he said. “It seems to be the result of an interaction of that outflowing material with objects near it.”\nMeerKAT image of the galactic center with color-coded position angles of the short, radial filaments.

Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nA schematic diagram of the outflow from Sagittarius A* showing the direction of the radial filaments. Courtesy: Farhad Yusef-Zadeh/Northwestern University\nThe vertical ones pose a different challenge to understand. They tower up to 150 light-years above the plane of the galaxy. Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow. That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nDifferent Types of Filaments, Milky-Way Style\nTheir origins likely explain the radically different orientations and characteristics of each filament population. The vertical filaments are perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and stretch up to around 150 light-years in length, while the horizontal ones are parallel to the plane and are only about 5 to 10 light-years long. The horizontals point radially toward the center of the galaxy where Sgr A* lies. The vertical ones are magnetic and relativistic (meaning their particles are moving near the speed of light). The horizontal filaments appear to emit thermal (warm) radiation and seem to be accelerating warmed material in a molecular cloud. There are just a few hundred of these horizontal filaments seen so far.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

There are just a few hundred of these horizontal filaments seen so far.\nThe vertical filaments appear around the nucleus of the galaxy while the horizontal ones spread out to only one side. According to Yusef-Zadeh, the radial outflows are somewhat lopsided. That may give some clues about the black hole region itself. \"One of the most important implications of radial outflow that we have detected is the orientation of the accretion disk and the jet-driven outflow from Sagittarius A* along the galactic plane,\" he said.\nLooking at the Filaments through Time\nWhile the radial filaments Yusef-Zadeh and his team found are a more recent discovery, the vertical ones are old friends. There are nearly a thousand of them grouped in pairs and clusters. Yusef-Zadeh says they are about 6 million years old.\nHe's been studying odd structures in the galactic core for decades. In 1984, he worked with astronomers Mark Morris and Don Chance to make a Very Large Array radio map of the galactic center in the 20-cm wavelength band when they first found the vertical structures. The emissions they detected came from nonthermally emitting (i.e. cool) gas arranged along magnetic structures. \n https://youtu.be/9LzJDpp_Wbo A video about the discovery of the radio bubble emanating from the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Courtesy: Northwestern University.\nLater on, in 2019, Yusef-Zadeh was part of a team led by astronomer Ian Haywood (University of Oxford) that used the MeerKAT radio observatory facility in South Africa to discover two gigantic radio-emitting bubbles near Sgr A*. That huge burst of energetic activity described earlier created those bubbles several million years ago.\nAt the time, the team immediately suspected Sgr A* as a source of the hourglass-shaped structure. “The center of our galaxy is relatively calm when compared to other galaxies with very active central black holes,” said Heywood. “Even so, the Milky Way’s central black hole can—from time to time—become uncharacteristically active, flaring up as it periodically devours massive clumps of dust and gas. It’s possible that one such feeding frenzy triggered powerful outbursts that inflated this previously unseen feature.”\nMeerKAT Scans the Bubbles\nThe discovery of radio bubbles in the galactic core a few years ago highlighted the great capabilities of the\n MeerKAT radio telescope. It's an array of 64 radio dishes sensitive to emissions in the microwave regime, ranging from wavelengths between 3 to 30 centimeters. Yusef-Zadeh credits the facility with helping his team to pinpoint the filaments against a busy background of other emitters. They used a technique to remove the background and smooth the noise from MeerKAT images in order to isolate the filaments from surrounding structures.\n“The new MeerKAT observations have been a game changer,” he said. “The advancement of technology and dedicated observing time have given us new information. It’s really a technical achievement from radio astronomers.”\nFor More Information\nMysterious dashes revealed in Milky Way’s CenterThe Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: Position Angle Distribution Reveals a Degree-scale Collimated Outflow from Sgr A* along the Galactic Plane\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
