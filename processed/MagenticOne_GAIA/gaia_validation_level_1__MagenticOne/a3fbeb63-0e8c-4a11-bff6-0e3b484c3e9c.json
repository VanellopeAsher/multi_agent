      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nHow many slides in this PowerPoint presentation mention crustaceans?\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename 'a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request asks about the number of slides in a PowerPoint presentation that mention crustaceans.\n   - The filename provided for the PowerPoint presentation is 'a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx'.\n   - The file is located in the current working directory.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - None specified in the request.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine the number of slides in the PowerPoint presentation that specifically mention crustaceans.\n   - This involves accessing and analyzing the content of the PowerPoint file.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - None in particular, as the task is primarily dependent on accessing and reading the contents of the PowerPoint file.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **File Access**: Use FileSurfer to locate and access the PowerPoint file 'a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx' in the current working directory.\n- **Content Extraction**: Utilize Assistant's Python skills to write a script that extracts text from each slide of the PowerPoint presentation.\n- **Text Analysis**: Analyze the extracted text to count the number of slides that mention the term \"crustaceans.\"\n- **Report Result**: Return the count of slides that mention crustaceans."
