Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request references Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article.\n   - The article was published in a journal named for one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The article includes a word quoted from two different authors in reference to the nature of dragon depictions, and this word was quoted in distaste.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The name of the journal associated with one of Hreidmar's sons.\n   - The specific word quoted by two different authors in Emily Midkiff's article.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's sons, particularly the one associated with a house and linked to the journal's name.\n   - The context and significance of dragon depictions that would have led to a word being quoted in distaste.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Hreidmar, from Norse mythology, had sons including Fafnir, Regin, and Ótr. The journal might be named after Fafnir, known for turning into a dragon and guarding treasure, which might fit the context of dragon depictions.\n   - The word in distaste might relate to negative or clichéd portrayals of dragons in literature or media, which are sometimes critiqued for being unoriginal or overly simplistic.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Identify the Journal Name**: Use the educated guess about Hreidmar’s sons to determine which journal the article could be in. Ask WebSurfer to verify if a journal exists with a name related to any of Hreidmar's sons, particularly \"Fafnir.\"\n- **Locate Emily Midkiff's Article**: Once the journal name is confirmed, use WebSurfer to search for Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in that journal.\n- **Identify the Quoted Word**: Use WebSurfer to access or obtain a summary of the relevant sections of Emily Midkiff's article to find the specific word quoted from two authors regarding the nature of dragon depictions.\n- **Verify**: Cross-reference any found information with additional sources online if necessary to ensure accuracy, utilizing WebSurfer for more comprehensive searches if anything seems unclear or ambiguous."

This   disconnect   with   traditional\ndragons   has   been   bemoaned   as   ruining   the   mythic   and   archetypal   power   of\ndragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than\nreadily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore:\nthe eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore,\nfrom which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary\nbeasts,   but   they   also   created   a   distinctly   unsettling   atmosphere   in   their   stories.\nModern   tamed   and   human-like   children’s   literature   dragons   borrow   certain\nuncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not\nalways   life-threatening   characters.   In   specific,   two   traits   borrowed   from   the\noriginal lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’\nintensely   possessive   gaze   and   their   clever,   manipulative   speech.   This   article\nanalyzes   these  Freudian   inheritances   to   argue   that   children’s   literature   dragons\nhave   not   been   entirely   softened   and   satirized;   the   potential   for   uncanny   fear\nembodied by  the human-like  behaviors  of legendary Western dragons  lingers  in\nmany modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are\nstill   strong   characters   and   can   and   should   be   analyzed   productively   through   a\nFreudian uncanny lens.\nKeywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature\nBiography and contact info: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children's Literature) is teaching and\nworking on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination,\nricher in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16). Dragons in mythology have\ncome   to   be   recognized   for   their   value   as   representations   of   ancient   cultures   or   as   worldwide\narchetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies;\nmedievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have\nflourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive\nmythic animals.\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n41\nEmily Midkiff\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\nYet   within   children’s   literature,   scholars   have   noted   a   trend   beginning   even   before   the\ndragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of\nfriendly dragon has become a well known resident of children’s  books, this  article argues that\nchildren’s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for\nuncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many\nmodern children’s literature dragons.\nFluffy Dragons\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more\nlaughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame’s “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898.\nRuth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly\ncuddly,   “fluffy”   nature   of   dragons   in   children’s   literature.   In   a   short   article   for  Elementary\nEducation,   Stein   expresses   hope   that   Tolkien’s   Smaug   would   improve   the   literary   dragon’s\nevolution   and  encourage   properly   scary   dragons.  While   this   has   since   proved  true   in  part,   the\nbemoaned   fluffy   dragons   remain   prevalent   alongside   Tolkien’s   menacing   breed.   Nonetheless\nBlount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they\ncould be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that\nfail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally\nbehave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in\norder to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and\neven praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the\noutdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223).\nHope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support\nthe observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of\n151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain"
