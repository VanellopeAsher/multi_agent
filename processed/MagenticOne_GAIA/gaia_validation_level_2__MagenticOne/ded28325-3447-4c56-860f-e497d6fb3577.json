      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nThis is a secret message my friend gave me. It says where we should meet for our picnic on Friday. The only problem is, it’s encrypted in the Caesar cipher, so I can’t read it. Can you tell me what it says? This is the message:\nZsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The message is encrypted using the Caesar cipher.\n   - The encrypted message is: \"Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.\"\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - None, as the Caesar cipher is a well-known encryption technique that doesn't require external resources for decryption.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The potential shift value used in the Caesar cipher needs to be determined to decrypt the message.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Caesar cipher typically uses a shift of 1 to 25. One common shift used historically is 3, but it could be any other number within this range. To decode the message, testing various shifts will likely be necessary.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Use the Assistant to write a Python script that can decrypt a Caesar cipher by testing all possible shift values (1 to 25) on the given message.\n- Run this script using the ComputerTerminal to find the correct decryption of the message.\n- Print out the decrypted message to see where the meeting location for the picnic is."

It then tests shift values from 1 to 25, printing out each possible decrypted message. You can run this script with the ComputerTerminal to find the decrypted message."
