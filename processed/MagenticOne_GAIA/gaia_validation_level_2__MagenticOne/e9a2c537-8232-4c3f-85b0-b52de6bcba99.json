      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nThe attached file shows a list of books in the collection of Scribe County Public Library. How many of the library’s books that are authored by Rick Riordan are not currently on the library’s shelves?\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename 'e9a2c537-8232-4c3f-85b0-b52de6bcba99.pdf' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves finding out how many books authored by Rick Riordan are not currently on the library’s shelves.\n   - The file in question is named 'e9a2c537-8232-4c3f-85b0-b52de6bcba99.pdf' and is presumably located in the current working directory.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The list of books authored by Rick Riordan, along with their availability status, needs to be obtained from the file 'e9a2c537-8232-4c3f-85b0-b52de6bcba99.pdf'.\n   - The availability status of each book to determine which are not currently on the library’s shelves.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The number of books authored by Rick Riordan that are not available on the library's shelves can be derived by filtering the list of the library's books for those authored by Rick Riordan and checking their status.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Rick Riordan is a well-known author, and it is likely that his books might be frequently borrowed, leading to some of them not being on the shelves.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Use FileSurfer to open the file 'e9a2c537-8232-4c3f-85b0-b52de6bcba99.pdf' and extract the list of books from the Scribe County Public Library collection.\n- Filter the extracted book information to identify those authored by Rick Riordan.\n- For each book by Rick Riordan, check its availability status to determine whether it is currently on the library's shelves.\n- Count and report the number of Rick Riordan's books that are not on the shelves."
