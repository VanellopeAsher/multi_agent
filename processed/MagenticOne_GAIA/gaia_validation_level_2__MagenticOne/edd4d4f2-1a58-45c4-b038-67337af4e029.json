      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nThe attached spreadsheet lists the locomotives owned by a local railroad museum. What is the typical American name for the type of locomotive this museum uses for the Murder Mystery Express?\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename 'edd4d4f2-1a58-45c4-b038-67337af4e029.xlsx' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves a spreadsheet listing locomotives owned by a local railroad museum.\n   - The museum uses a locomotive for the Murder Mystery Express.\n   - The filename of the spreadsheet is 'edd4d4f2-1a58-45c4-b038-67337af4e029.xlsx'.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The contents of the spreadsheet, specifically which type of locomotive is used for the Murder Mystery Express.\n   - Typical American names for different types of locomotives which can be identified via historical railroad resources or locomotive classification references.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine the most common or classic type of locomotive typically associated with themed trains like the Murder Mystery Express, based on common practice or thematic elements.\n   - Deduce which locomotive from the list might be used based on any potential thematic naming conventions or characteristics typical for such events.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The locomotive for the Murder Mystery Express may be a steam locomotive, as they are often used for historical or themed train events in the U.S. due to their classic appeal.\n   - It might be a well-known type like a 4-4-0 American type locomotive, known for its historical significance in U.S. railroads, or another classic model known for its aesthetics and nostalgic value in such storytelling contexts.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- FileSurfer will open and inspect the spreadsheet 'edd4d4f2-1a58-45c4-b038-67337af4e029.xlsx' to identify the type of locomotive used by the museum for the Murder Mystery Express.\n- FileSurfer will extract relevant details from the spreadsheet about the locomotives, focusing on any mention of the Murder Mystery Express or identifying locomotive types.\n- If the spreadsheet lists locomotive models or types, WebSurfer may be asked to research these models to determine their typical American names and ascertain which type is typically used for themed events like the Murder Mystery Express."
