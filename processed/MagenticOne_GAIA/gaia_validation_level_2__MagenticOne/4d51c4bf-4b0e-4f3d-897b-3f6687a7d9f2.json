Each client has ordered a new awning for the back of their house within the last 90 days. The company makes different designs depending on whether the awning is made to block sunrises or sunsets. In this region, houses with odd-numbered street addresses face east, and houses with even-numbered street addresses face west. How many of these clients will be receiving the sunset awning design?\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename '4d51c4bf-4b0e-4f3d-897b-3f6687a7d9f2.xlsx' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The company creates different awning designs based on the direction a house faces.\n- Odd-numbered street addresses face east, needing a sunrise awning.\n- Even-numbered street addresses face west, needing a sunset awning.\n- The file containing client information is named '4d51c4bf-4b0e-4f3d-897b-3f6687a7d9f2.xlsx'.\n### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The actual client data within the file '4d51c4bf-4b0e-4f3d-897b-3f6687a7d9f2.xlsx'.\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The number of clients listed in the provided file who will receive the sunset awning design can be derived by counting the number of even-numbered street addresses.\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Houses with even-numbered street addresses likely constitute roughly half of the total clients, assuming a random distribution of addresses.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **FileSurfer**: Open the file '4d51c4bf-4b0e-4f3d-897b-3f6687a7d9f2.xlsx' to extract the list of client addresses.\n- **Assistant**: Determine how to identify even-numbered street addresses from the client list.\n- **Assistant**: Write a Python script to process the extracted list and count the even-numbered addresses, thereby determining how many clients will receive the sunset awning design.\n- **ComputerTerminal**: Execute the Python script to obtain the result."
