      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nThe attached file shows the locomotives in the collection of a North American railroad museum. How many wheels do the listed steam locomotives have in total?\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename '54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves calculating the total number of wheels on steam locomotives listed in an Excel file.\n   - The filename of the Excel file is '54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx'.\n   - The file is located in the current working directory.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific types and models of steam locomotives in the collection.\n   - The wheel arrangement or configuration of each locomotive type, which can typically be looked up in locomotive classification guides or historical railway references.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The total number of wheels for each locomotive type based on their wheel configuration.\n   - The cumulative total of wheels for all the steam locomotives listed in the file.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Common wheel arrangements for steam locomotives (e.g., 4-4-0, 4-6-2, 2-8-0) can be used as a baseline to estimate wheel counts.\n   - Most North American steam locomotives follow the Whyte notation system, which identifies locomotives by the number of leading wheels, driving wheels, and trailing wheels.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **FileSurfer**: Open and examine the Excel file '54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx' to extract information about the steam locomotives, specifically their types or models and wheel configurations if available.\n- **Assistant**: If the wheel configurations or locomotive types are extracted from the file, determine any missing wheel configuration information using standard locomotive wheel arrangements (like the Whyte notation). Calculate the total number of wheels.\n- **WebSurfer**: If necessary, look up specific locomotive wheel arrangements and configurations not found in the file using reliable sources on the web.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the data and calculate the total number of wheels for all steam locomotives in the collection. Provide a summary of the findings."
