      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal of 2015, how many of the \"twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac\" have a hand visible?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request mentions the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal of 2015.\n   - The request references \"the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac.\"\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific title and details of the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition related to the Chinese zodiac.\n   - Information about which animal represented the Chinese zodiac year of 2015.\n   - Descriptions or images of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac as potentially depicted in the exhibition to identify those with visible hands.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine from images or descriptions which of the zodiac animals traditionally have depictions with visible hands and whether they are likely represented as such in the exhibition.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Recalling the Chinese zodiac animals: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.\n   - Knowing that Animals like the Monkey and Dragon may potentially have depictions with hands.\n   - Considering that art exhibitions may vary in their representations, so assumptions about visibility of hands may not always apply.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- WebSurfer: Search for information on the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition related to the Chinese zodiac, specifically identifying which Chinese zodiac animal the exhibition was titled after and any details about the representation of the twelve zodiac animals.\n- WebSurfer: Collect images or descriptions of the exhibition to identify which animals have visible hands, focusing on the twelve Chinese zodiac animals traditionally depicted in art.\n- Assistant: Use any findings from the WebSurfer to determine which of the twelve zodiac animals have visible hands based on the representations from the exhibition.\n- Compile the final count of the zodiac animals with visible hands and provide additional context if available."
