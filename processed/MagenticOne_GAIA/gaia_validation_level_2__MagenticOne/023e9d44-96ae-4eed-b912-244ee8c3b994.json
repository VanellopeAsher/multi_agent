I always recycle my water bottles at the end of a trip, and I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100. Assuming I follow I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then take I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, how many dollars will I get back according to Wikipedia?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - It is May 2023.\n   - The route includes I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta.\n   - Five 12-ounce water bottles are consumed for every 100 miles traveled, rounded to the nearest 100 miles.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The exact distance covered on the specified route from Los Angeles to Augusta via Cincinnati.\n   - The bottle deposit refund amount by state, particularly along the specified route (California to Maine), according to Wikipedia or another authoritative source.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The total number of 100-mile increments traveled on the route to determine the total number of water bottles consumed.\n   - The total refund amount based on the number of bottles and the deposit amounts in each state, according to the applicable bottle-return laws.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Interstate distances commonly found from historical or other common reference points.\n   - State laws about bottle deposits typically found in Wikipedia or state government resources.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for and determine the total distance of the route from Los Angeles to Augusta via Cincinnati, following I-40 and I-90.\n- **WebSurfer**: Look up the bottle deposit refund rates by state along the route, focusing on the specific states the route crosses, according to Wikipedia.\n- **Assistant**: Calculate the total number of 100-mile increments for the entire trip based on the distance obtained, which will determine the number of water bottles consumed.\n- **Assistant**: Use the bottle deposit rates gathered to calculate the total refund amount based on the number of consumed water bottles and the states' refund policies encountered along the route."

Studies show that the recycling rate for beverage containers is vastly increased with a bottle bill. The United States' overall beverage container recycling rate is approximately 33%, while states with container deposit laws have a 70% average rate of beverage container recycling. Michigan's recycling rate of 97% from 1990 to 2008 was the highest in the nation, as is its $0.10 deposit.\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Container deposit legislation in the United States\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_deposit_legislation_in_the_United_States\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5164892\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5164892\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2010-01-21T23:09:31Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-02-26T20:52:21Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Bottle_label.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"overview about the container deposit legislation in the United States\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.44.0-wmf.21\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Bottle_label.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"520\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Container deposit legislation in the United States - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

      "content": "Container deposit legislation (CDL) in the United States involves a refundable deposit on recyclable beverage containers to boost recycling rates. Currently, ten states have such laws, often referred to as \"bottle bills,\" with Michigan having the highest recycling rate of 97% due to its $0.10 deposit. States with CDL have an average recycling rate of 70%, compared to the national average of 33%. The beverage industry and consumers primarily fund these programs, with unclaimed deposits being managed differently across states. For example, unclaimed deposits become state property in Connecticut and Michigan, while they cover administrative costs in California and Hawaii. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most states temporarily suspended bottle bill requirements.\nControversies surrounding CDL include its role as a social aid, allowing low-income individuals to collect and redeem bottles. Additionally, concerns have arisen about the burden of deposits on consumers and related criminal offenses, such as fraud through out-of-state container redemption. Despite these issues, proponents argue that the legislation significantly increases recycling rates and reduces environmental waste. Several states are considering expanding or introducing container deposit laws, but face challenges such as political opposition and beverage industry pushback."
