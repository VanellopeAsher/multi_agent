Of the universities that these bachelor's degrees were from, which is the westernmost university and which is the easternmost university? Give them to me as a comma-separated list, I only want the name of the cities where the universities are located, with the westernmost city listed first.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - Individuals who formally held the position of United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019, excluding those who held the position in an acting capacity, have a bachelor's degree.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The names of individuals who served as United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019.\n   - The universities where these secretaries obtained their bachelor's degrees.\n   - The geographical locations (cities) of these universities.\n   - The longitudinal coordinates of these cities to determine which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which university cities are the westernmost and easternmost based on longitudinal coordinates.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The list of universities might include prominent institutions known for political or public administration programs, often attended by individuals who reach high governmental positions. Possible cities could include Washington, D.C., Cambridge, MA, or others known for such universities.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: Research the names of individuals who served as the United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019, excluding those in acting capacity. Gather information on the universities where they obtained their bachelor's degrees.\n- **WebSurfer**: Determine the locations (cities) of these universities based on the information gathered.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the list of cities with latitude and longitude data, using an internal or external dataset if necessary.\n- **Assistant**: Analyze the longitudinal data to determine which city is the westernmost and which is the easternmost, and present the cities as a comma-separated list with the westernmost city first."

Of the universities that these bachelor's degrees were from, which is the westernmost university and which is the easternmost university? Give them to me as a comma-separated list, I only want the name of the cities where the universities are located, with the westernmost city listed first.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - Individuals who formally held the position of United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019, excluding those in an acting capacity, have a bachelor's degree.\n   - Names of some secretaries before April 2019 include Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff, Janet Napolitano, Jeh Johnson, John F. Kelly, and Kirstjen Nielsen.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The universities where these secretaries obtained their bachelor's degrees.\n   - The geographical locations (cities) of these universities.\n   - The longitudinal coordinates of these cities to determine which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which university cities are the westernmost and easternmost based on longitudinal coordinates.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The universities are likely to be notable institutions, potentially including those known for political or legal education. \n   - Cities like Palo Alto, CA (Stanford University), or New Haven, CT (Yale University) might be possibilities due to their prominence and geographic distribution.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n### Explanation of the Root Cause of Failure:\nThe main issue was an inability to efficiently gather specific educational background details for each U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security who served before April 2019. This was due to a lack of focused resources or directories that provide a consolidated view of their educational histories.\n### New Plan:\n1. **WebSurfer**: \n   - Directly search for individual biographies of each secretary using official or notable educational websites, such as alumni directories or educational history listings.\n   - Specifically target university websites and other reliable sources to find details on their educational backgrounds.\n2. **Assistant**:\n   - Compile the data received from WebSurfer into a cohesive list, focusing on the university attended by each individual.\n   - Gather cities of the universities to prepare for geographical analysis.\n3. **Assistant**:\n   - Use a dataset or API like Google Maps API to look up the longitudinal coordinates of the identified cities.\n4. **Assistant**:\n   - Analyze the longitudinal data to determine the westernmost and easternmost cities.\n5. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Verify the findings with a final search for any inconsistencies or additional information that might affect the results. \nBy focusing on direct and more reliable sources, we aim to circumvent the issues faced in finding precise educational backgrounds."
