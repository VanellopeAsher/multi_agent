      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nHow many images are there in the latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - There are no specific facts or figures directly given in the request itself.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The number of images in the latest 2022 Lego English Wikipedia article. This would require looking up the current Lego article on the English version of Wikipedia.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - There are no derived facts needed based on the request. The request requires a lookup rather than a derivation.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Wikipedia articles on popular topics like Lego typically contain multiple images, often including the company's logo, historical images of the first Lego sets, and images of popular Lego sets from different eras. However, this still requires verification for accuracy.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Instruct WebSurfer to navigate to the English Wikipedia website.\n- Have WebSurfer search for the article on Lego, ensuring that it reflects the latest updates, ideally from 2022.\n- Once WebSurfer has found the correct article, ask them to count the number of images present in the article.\n- Summarize the number of images found and communicate this back."
