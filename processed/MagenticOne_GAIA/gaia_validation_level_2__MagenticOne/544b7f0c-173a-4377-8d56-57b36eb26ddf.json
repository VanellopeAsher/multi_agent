      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn Valentina Re’s contribution to the 2017 book “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries”, what horror movie does the author cite as having popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality? Use the complete name with article if any.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves Valentina Re’s contribution to the 2017 book “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries”.\n   - It mentions the popularization of metalepsis between a dream world and reality in a horror movie cited by the author.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific horror movie mentioned by Valentina Re in her contribution to the book.\n   - Information could be found in the 2017 book “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries” by accessing Valentina Re’s chapter or section.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None specifically derived from the given information. However, logical connections could be made if details of the context from the book or chapter were known.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - A potential guess for the horror movie could be \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" due to its theme of blending dream and reality, though this needs verification from the source itself.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find information on Valentina Re’s contribution to the 2017 book “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.” Specifically, look for any excerpts or summaries that mention the horror movie cited for popularizing metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n- **FileSurfer**: If the web search does not yield sufficient information, check any local files that may contain the book “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries” or related excerpts.\n- **Assistant**: Once the information is gathered, verify the name of the horror movie and provide a brief explanation of its relevance to metalepsis between a dream world and reality based on the source material."

By exploring the concept of worlds from theoretical and practical perspectives, this book puts forward a unique and original starting point for rethinking media theory, going beyond the notion of communication and understanding the role of worlds in interaction rituals as well as the building of values and meaning in contemporary society.In recent years, due to digital distribution and the integration of social networking and entertainment content, viewing strategies and narrative forms are undergoing important changes. Notably, we are faced with the rise of multi- platform conglomerates, in which film, television, Internet, graphic novels, toys, and virtual environments create heterogeneous yet compact universes, recognizable as brands and having a well-defined semiotic identity. Scholars are looking for new theoretical tools to understand the role of contemporary new media in these phenomena and the increasingly central place that viewers hold in exploring, mapping, interpreting and expanding story worlds.  On the one hand, Internet networks are increasingly studied as the environment for the emergence of forms of consumption through fragments. As Henry Jenkins recently underlined, media become spreadable (Jenkins, Ford, Green 2013). On the other, the observation of production practices in the contemporary media sphere shows that, instead of being only fluid and ephemeral elements, media fragments sometimes converge in persistent and heterogeneous spaces built from multiple contributions and comparable to worlds. Media creators don't merely forge stories or characters. Instead, they build worlds: fictional worlds, character worlds, alternative worlds...\",\n            \"identifier\": \"oapen-20.500.12657-25975\",\n            \"interactionStatistic\": {\n                \"itemType\": \"http://schema.org/InteractionCounter\",\n                \"interactionType\": \"\",\n                \"userInteractionCount\": \"380\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"itemType\": \"http://schema.org/InteractionCounter\",\n            \"interactionType\": \"\",\n            \"userInteractionCount\": \"380\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"bpjKvUvsX0lxfmjg19TLblckWkDpnptZEYsBntApxUk\",\n        \"mediatype\": \"texts\",\n        \"primary_collection\": \"oapen-library\",\n        \"description\": \"This edited collection of original essays situates itself at the cutting edge of media theory, exploring imaginary worlds as forms of knowledge and forms of...\",\n        \"og:title\": \"World Building - Transmedia, Fans, Industries : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive\",\n        \"og:description\": \"This edited collection of original essays situates itself at the cutting edge of media theory, exploring imaginary worlds as forms of knowledge and forms of...\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Internet Archive\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://archive.org/services/img/oapen-20.500.12657-25975\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://archive.org/details/oapen-20.500.12657-25975\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"player\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@internetarchive\",\n        \"twitter:account_id\": \"18957805\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"This edited collection of original essays situates itself at the cutting edge of media theory, exploring imaginary worlds as forms of knowledge and forms of...\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"World Building - Transmedia, Fans, Industries : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://archive.org/services/img/oapen-20.500.12657-25975/full/pct:200/0/default.jpg\",\n        \"monetization\": \"$ilp.uphold.com/D7BwPKMQzBiD\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
