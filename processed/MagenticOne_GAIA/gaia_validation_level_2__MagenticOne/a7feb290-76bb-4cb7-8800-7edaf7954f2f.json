      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nHow many High Energy Physics - Lattice articles listed in January 2020 on Arxiv had ps versions available?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about \"High Energy Physics - Lattice articles\" listed on \"Arxiv\" in \"January 2020.\"\n- The specific query is regarding how many of these articles had \"ps versions available.\"\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The number of High Energy Physics - Lattice articles listed on Arxiv in January 2020.\n- The availability of ps versions for these articles.\n- This information can specifically be found by checking the Arxiv database or website for entries in the category of High Energy Physics - Lattice for the month of January 2020.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determining whether the total number of articles with ps versions represents a specific percentage or fraction of the total articles for that category and month.\n- Analyzing any potential trends or commonalities among articles that offer ps versions.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- It is possible that only a portion of the High Energy Physics - Lattice articles have ps versions available, as not all authors might choose to, or are able to, provide this format.\n- Common knowledge suggests that formats other than PDF (such as ps) are typically used less frequently, so the number with ps versions might be relatively lower.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer Task**: Use WebSurfer to access the Arxiv website and navigate to the High Energy Physics - Lattice section for the month of January 2020. \n- **Data Collection**: Once on the relevant page, collect data on the number of articles listed and determine how many of these have ps versions available. \n- **Analyze and Report**: Compile a brief report summarizing the number of articles and how many have ps versions. Indicate any obvious trends or insights if present. \nThis plan primarily involves leveraging WebSurfer's capabilities to gather the needed data from Arxiv.org, as they have convenient access to the web and can interact with site content efficiently."

These papers include studies on various topics such as semileptonic decay structure functions, spectral function reconstruction, muon g-2 lattice QCD developments, and topological charge density correlation functions. The papers often intersect with related fields such as high energy physics phenomenology, quantum physics, and statistical mechanics. Many contributions also form part of proceedings from the 37th International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2019) held in Wuhan, China.\nSignificant works include developments in lattice QCD, explorations of anomalies in gauge theories, and the realization of real-time dynamics through quantum simulations. The listed studies often involve extensive analyses using theoretical and computational methods, benefiting from collaborations across multiple fields such as condensed matter physics, quantum cosmology, and many-body quantum dynamics. Each entry includes an abstract, authors, subjects related to the paper, and often, information about the paper's presentation at international conferences or its publication in scholarly journals."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nHow many High Energy Physics - Lattice articles listed in January 2020 on Arxiv had ps versions available?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nSure, here's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about \"High Energy Physics - Lattice articles\" listed on \"Arxiv\" in \"January 2020.\"\n- The specific query is regarding how many of these articles had \"ps versions available.\"\n- A total of 97 High Energy Physics - Lattice articles were listed for January 2020.\n- A search engine could display relevant pages, indicating the presence of ps formats among various article links.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact number of articles with ps versions using automated tools or scripts.\n- Direct access to Arxiv’s specific January 2020 listing for High Energy Physics - Lattice.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determining the specific fraction or percentage of articles that offer ps versions.\n- Identifying why some articles offer ps formats, exploring trends or common features.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Some articles likely feature 'other' format links indicating ps availability.\n- Ps versions are generally less common than PDF versions, making them a potentially smaller subset.\n- Automated scripts or external tools may be required to count ps versions due to search navigation issues.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\n- The search didn't directly lead to the specific January 2020 Arxiv page needed for counting the presence of ps versions, due to navigation issues.\n- Dependence on manual navigation and searching, rather than directly accessing the specific listing.\n- Lack of automated counting or extraction method for ps versions.\n**New Plan:**\n- **WebSurfer Task - Direct Access:**\n  - Navigate directly to the Arxiv 'High Energy Physics - Lattice' archive page.\n  - Use search functions within the Arxiv site to locate the January 2020 listings.\n- **Assistant Role - Automation Script:**\n  - Write a Python script to scrape the specific January 2020 archive page for any ps version links.\n  - Use BeautifulSoup for web scraping, focusing on identifying 'other' formats.\n- **Testing and Verification:**\n  - Run the script and verify the output by cross-referencing a small sample manually.\n  - Ensure robust error handling in the script for invalid or changed link formats.\n- **Feedback Loop:**\n  - If script issues arise, adapt with additional error messages or alternative scraping techniques.\n  - Double-check all findings with multiple attempts if results seem inconsistent."
