      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nHow many pages if the 2023 IPCC report (85 pages version) mentions nuclear energy?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request specifies an 85-page version of the 2023 IPCC report.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The number of pages in the 2023 IPCC report that mention nuclear energy. This information could potentially be found by reviewing the report itself or a summary or analysis of the report. The IPCC's official website or related scientific publications would be the right place to find such data.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - If the exact number of pages is not explicitly stated, it might be necessary to derive this by searching through the content of the report for terms related to nuclear energy and estimating their coverage per page.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Historically, IPCC reports have discussed various energy sources, including nuclear energy, within the context of climate change mitigation strategies. Therefore, it is likely that the report would have at least some discussion on nuclear energy.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Ask WebSurfer to search for the 85-page version of the 2023 IPCC report and gather information about its content, specifically focusing on mentions of nuclear energy.\n- If available online, request WebSurfer to access the report directly and identify the sections or pages that discuss nuclear energy.\n- If the report is not available in a format that can be searched online, WebSurfer should check for any summaries, analyses, or reviews of the report that mention how extensively nuclear energy is discussed.\n- Once the relevant information is obtained, determine the number of pages in the 2023 IPCC report that mention nuclear energy to address the original request."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nHow many pages if the 2023 IPCC report (85 pages version) mentions nuclear energy?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - We downloaded and have access to the 2023 IPCC report as a PDF file.\n   - The report is not exactly 85 pages; it comprises 71 pages.\n   - The request specifies an 85-page version, but no such version is identified directly in our findings.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Confirm if there is any mention of an 85-page version of the IPCC report for 2023.\n   - Determine the number of pages in the accessed report that mention nuclear energy. This can be achieved by searching through the document for the relevant terms.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - If the exact number of pages discussing nuclear energy is not explicitly stated, derive this information by searching through the content of the report for relevant terms.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Considering the report is 71 pages, it is unlikely there's a separate 85-page version unless it's a different format or publication. Therefore, our analysis should focus on the 71-page document we have.\n   - Given the historical context, nuclear energy is likely mentioned in the context of climate change mitigation, which supports the likelihood of its discussion in the report.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**What Went Wrong:**\n- The search didn't locate any mention of an 85-page version of the 2023 IPCC report.\n- A successful search for the term 'nuclear energy' in the 71-page document was not executed due to repeated steps without progress.\n**New Plan:**\n- **Initial Research:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to verify whether an 85-page version of the 2023 IPCC report exists or if the query refers to a different section or summary of the same content.\n- **Document Search:**\n  - Use FileSurfer to perform a keyword search in the downloaded 71-page PDF for 'nuclear energy'.\n  - Identify pages that contain the keyword and count these pages.\n- **Analysis:**\n  - If discrepancies between the expected 85 pages and the 71 pages are found, note potential reasons (e.g., differences in document versions or formats).\n  - Summarize the number of pages where nuclear energy is mentioned.\n**Avoiding Mistakes:**\n- Ensure clear, single responsibility tasks explicit to each agent.\n- Avoid redundant searches or overlapping processes within the same PDF.\n- Efficiently use resources by leveraging agents' unique capabilities: FileSurfer for document handling and WebSurfer for additional verification."

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - We downloaded and have access to the 2023 IPCC report as a PDF file.\n   - The report is 71 pages long.\n   - No 85-page version of the IPCC 2023 report has been identified from current findings.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Confirm if an 85-page version of the IPCC report for 2023 exists or was mentioned in any context.\n   - Execute a successful keyword search for 'nuclear energy' within the accessible 71-page PDF to identify the number of pages mentioning it.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Derive the number of pages referencing 'nuclear energy' by conducting a detailed search within the document.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The repeated failure to find an 85-page version implies that there may be confusion or miscommunication regarding multiple versions of the report. It is possible that the request refers to a specific part of the wider IPCC documentation not represented here.\n   - Historically, reports like this one have included discussions on nuclear energy as part of mitigation strategies for climate change, suggesting it should appear in a relevant section.\n   - An exhaustive search of the 71-page document should be conducted to focus our efforts on gaining accurate results from available data.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**What Went Wrong:**\n- The process repeated searching for 'nuclear energy' without progress due to the FileSurfer not reporting any search results. There was a lack of verification on whether the keyword search function was executed correctly.\n- There might be issues in the communication of instructions or the inability to execute the search command as intended within the 71-page document.\n**New Plan:**\n- **Initial Check:**\n  - Ensure that the keyword search functionality is executable by the FileSurfer agent. Verify proper configuration for document parsing.\n- **Step-by-Step Execution:**\n  - Instruct FileSurfer clearly to search for 'nuclear energy' within the accessible document to avoid misinterpreting commands.\n  - Ensure that FileSurfer outputs the specific page numbers or an explicit statement explaining why the search could not be executed.\n- **Verification:**\n  - If the search fails, check if there's a way to extract the document text for manual scanning or use another method to determine content relevance (e.g., scripting).\n- **Addressing the 85-page Query:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search online for any references or mentions of an 85-page version of this IPCC report to corroborate its existence or clarify any misconceptions.\n- **Avoiding Repetition:**\n  - Establish clear goals for each agent’s task, addressing both primary actions and alternative approaches in case of failure.\n  - Communicate results or issues in execution promptly to adjust the plan and prevent redundant tasks."

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the revised fact sheet, incorporating new insights and adjustments:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - We downloaded and have access to the 2023 IPCC report as a PDF file.\n   - The report is 71 pages long.\n   - No 85-page version of the IPCC 2023 report has been found in our previous searches or verified from our current data sources.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Confirm if any official references, announcements, or publications mention an 85-page version of the IPCC 2023 report.\n   - Conduct a keyword search for 'nuclear energy' within the 71-page PDF to determine how often it is mentioned and on which pages.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine the number of pages referencing 'nuclear energy' in the 71-page document via a detailed search.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The absence of an 85-page version may indicate a confusion or misinformation. It might be associated with a different document or a misinterpretation of the current report's format.\n   - Given the typical contents of IPCC reports, it is highly likely that discussions on nuclear energy appear in sections related to energy transitions and climate mitigation strategies.\n   - Clarifying and precisely executing the keyword search within the downloaded document is essential in determining the mentions, suggesting a focus on ensuring technical execution.\n   - Misinterpretation of page count might stem from layout variations in document formats (e.g., printed, digital), pointing to a need to explore other related IPCC publications or sections that might match the 85-page description.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**What Went Wrong:**\n- The issue primarily stemmed from the incomplete execution of a keyword search for 'nuclear energy' within the available 71-page PDF document. It was unclear whether the search functionality was executed correctly by the FileSurfer agent.\n- There was repeated verification without any resolution, potentially due to communication gaps in instructing FileSurfer, or technical execution issues when performing the search.\n- Additionally, failure to locate an 85-page version and verify its existence might indicate that focus needs to be broadened beyond the immediate PDF file to consider online resources or references.\n**New Plan:**\n- **Clarify and Confirm Access:**\n  - Ensure FileSurfer is ready to handle PDF documents and can execute keyword searches effectively. Reiterate the intent and process clearly for handling the file.\n- **Targeted Search Execution:**\n  - Direct FileSurfer to perform a keyword search explicitly inside the 71-page PDF to identify and record all pages where 'nuclear energy' is mentioned.\n  - If the keyword search doesn't provide results, consider leveraging scripting or textual extraction via ComputerTerminal to support the search function.\n- **External Verification for 85-page Query:**\n  - Deploy WebSurfer to perform a targeted search to verify the existence or mention of an 85-page version of the report. Focus on IPCC official communications or news reports.\n- **Alternative Approach:**\n  - Delegate potential extraction and scripting tasks to ComputerTerminal if FileSurfer faces issues with digital document manipulation.\n  - Assist WebSurfer in finding any references to layout differences or document distribution that might clarify the confusion around multiple versions.\n- **Avoid Redundancy:**\n  - Communicate real-time results and obstacles to adjust strategy accordingly and prevent repeated missteps.\n  - Evaluate each agent’s execution process to ensure direct and accurate task completion as outlined.\nThis plan ensures efficient use of all available agents by focusing on the appropriate distribution of tasks, resolving technical issues, and broadening the scope of inquiry where necessary."

Introduction\nThis Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)\nsummarises the state of knowledge of climate change, its widespread\nimpacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, based\non the peer-reviewed scientiﬁc, technical and socio-economic literature\nsince  the  publication  of  the  IPCC’s  Fifth Assessment  Report  (AR5)  in\n2014.\nfutures. It considers long-term characteristics, impacts, risks and costs\nin  adaptation  and  mitigation  pathways  in  the  context  of  sustainable\ndevelopment. Section 4, ‘Near- Term Responses in a Changing Climate’,\nassesses opportunities for scaling up effective action in the period up\nto 2040, in the context of climate pledges, and commitments, and the\npursuit of sustainable development.\nBased on scientiﬁc understanding, key ﬁndings can be formulated as\nstatements of fact or associated with an assessed level of conﬁdence\nusing  the  IPCC  calibrated  language62.  The  scientiﬁc  ﬁndings  are\ndrawn  from the  underlying  reports  and arise from  their Summary for\nPolicymakers  (hereafter  SPM), Technical  Summary  (hereafter TS),  and\nunderlying chapters and are indicated by {} brackets.

It reﬂects the increasing diversity of those involved in\nclimate action.\nThis  report  integrates  the  main  ﬁndings  of  the  AR6  Working  Group\nreports58  and  the  three  AR6  Special  Reports59.  It  recognizes  the\ninterdependence  of  climate,  ecosystems  and  biodiversity,  and  human\nsocieties;  the  value  of  diverse  forms  of  knowledge;  and  the  close\nlinkages  between  climate  change  adaptation,  mitigation,  ecosystem\nhealth,  human  well-being  and  sustainable  development.  Building  on\nmultiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and\nsocial  sciences,  this  report  identiﬁes  opportunities  for  transformative\naction which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts\nof systems transitions and resilient development pathways60. Different\nregional  classiﬁcation  schemes61  are  used  for  physical,  social  and\neconomic aspects, reﬂecting the underlying literature.\nS\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n1\nAfter  this  introduction,  Section  2, ‘Current  Status  and Trends’,  opens\nwith  the  assessment  of  observational  evidence  for  our  changing\nclimate,  historical  and  current  drivers  of  human-induced  climate\nchange,  and  its  impacts.  It  assesses  the  current  implementation  of\nadaptation  and  mitigation  response  options.  Section  3,  ‘Long-Term\nClimate and Development Futures’, provides a long-term assessment of\nclimate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of socio-economic\n58\nThe three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and Climate\nChange 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, respectively. Their assessments cover scientiﬁc literature accepted for publication respectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September\n2021 and 11 October 2021.\n59\nThe three Special Reports are : Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related\nglobal greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate\npoverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertiﬁcation, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and\ngreenhouse gas ﬂuxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientiﬁc literature\naccepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and 15 May 2019.\n60\nThe Glossary (Annex I) includes deﬁnitions of these, and other terms and concepts used in this report drawn from the AR6 joint Working Group Glossary.\n61  Depending on the climate information context, geographical regions in AR6 may refer to larger areas, such as sub-continents and oceanic regions, or to typological regions, such\nas monsoon regions, coastlines, mountain ranges or cities.
