I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Answer with the following format: x.xx\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename 'd8152ad6-e4d5-4c12-8bb7-8d57dc10c6de.png' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The current plan is the \"Standard\" plan.\n   - 60 equally sized files were uploaded.\n   - The upload resulted in being 100GB over the limit.\n   - There are 980 more files of the same size to upload.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The details of the \"Standard\" plan, particularly its storage limit.\n   - The cost and details of any upgrades available from the \"Standard\" plan that would allow for storing all files.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The size of each file.\n   - The total storage size needed for all files.\n   - The smallest plan that accommodates all files.\n   - The additional cost incurred per file by upgrading to the appropriate plan.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - File sizes are consistent across all 1040 files (60 + 980).\n   - The upgrade plan will have a defined cost structure that allows calculation of per-file cost.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **FileSurfer**: Open and analyze the file 'd8152ad6-e4d5-4c12-8bb7-8d57dc10c6de.png' to check for any details on the \"Standard\" plan's specifications, specifically its storage limit.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for information on the pricing and storage limits for potential upgrade options from the \"Standard\" plan to accommodate an additional 100GB plus the storage required for the remaining 980 files. \n- **Assistant**: Once the storage limit of the \"Standard\" plan and potential upgrade options are identified, calculate the size of each file based on the information provided in the request (i.e., being 100GB over the limit after uploading 60 files).\n- **Assistant**: Calculate the total storage required for all 1040 files and determine the most economical plan to accommodate them.\n- **Assistant**: Compute the additional cost per file based on the cost difference between the two plans and the number of additional files. \nAfter these steps, provide the result formatted according to the request."

      "content": "Let's break down the calculations step by step:\n1. **Determine the File Size:**\n   - You uploaded 60 files and went 100GB over the 500GB limit.\n   - Total storage after these 60 files = 600GB (500GB + 100GB over the limit). \n   - Therefore, the 60 files must collectively be 600GB, and each file's size is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{File Size} = \\frac{600\\text{GB}}{60} = 10\\text{GB per file}\n   \\]\n2. **Total Storage Required for All Files:**\n   - Total files = 1040 (60 already uploaded + 980 more files).\n   - Total storage needed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Storage} = 1040 \\times 10\\text{GB} = 10400\\text{GB} = 10.4\\text{TB}\n   \\]\n3. **Identify the Suitable Upgrade Plan:**\n   - The 2TB Premium plan (€9.99/mo) is insufficient as it doesn't cover 10.4TB.\n   - To store 10.4TB, a custom plan might be needed.\n   - For the sake of calculation, assume the solution would use a custom enterprise-level plan or the cost scales linearly.\n4. **Compute Additional Cost per File:**\n   - Since a direct plan was not found, assume hypothetically that the minimal upgrade plan cost scales directly proportional to storage in real scenarios.\n   - For example, hypothetically, if the cost was $1 per TB in a real-world scenario, that would equate to \\(10.4 \\times \\text{cost per TB}\\) per month.\n   - Calculate the per-file cost considering linear scalability:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per File} = \\frac{\\text{Hypothetical Plan Monthly Cost}}{980}   \n   \\]\nSince exact cost plans weren't discovered above, for real-life use, replace \"Hypothetical Plan Monthly Cost\" with actual provider costs for 10.4TB storage plans.\nDo replace any assumptions with specific provider data if you have or need specific detailed quotes or alternatives.\nPlease use this framework to map precisely with real plans or enter specific negotiations for bulk storage larger than common public plans offer."
