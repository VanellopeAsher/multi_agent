      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request pertains to a video game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The video game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019. This information can be found on the British Academy Games Awards official website or through a reliable secondary source such as news articles covering the awards.\n   - The Wikipedia page for the winning game and the number of revisions it had before the month listed as its release date. This can be found on Wikipedia itself.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The number of Wikipedia revisions before the game's release date can be derived by examining the revision history of the Wikipedia page for the game. \n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The game that won the award might be a well-known title released in 2019, but specifics would need to be confirmed through research.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Step 1:** Ask WebSurfer to find out which video game won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n- **Step 2:** Once the game is identified, have WebSurfer find the Wikipedia page for that video game.\n- **Step 3:** Determine the release date of the game from its Wikipedia page, focusing on the month and year.\n- **Step 4:** Examine the revision history of the Wikipedia page up to the release month and year. WebSurfer can summarize or list revision counts if possible.\n- **Step 5:** Calculate the total number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the release month using the information from the revision history."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The video game \"God of War\" won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - \"God of War\" was released worldwide in April 2018 for the PlayStation 4.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Count the number of revisions the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page had before April 2018, the game's release month.\n   - Confirm the exact date of \"God of War\" winning the British Academy Games Award in 2019 for documentation.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine the total number of Wikipedia revisions before April 2018 by analyzing the revision history available on Wikipedia.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It is likely that the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" had multiple revisions leading up to its release given its popularity and significance as part of a major franchise. This reflects typical patterns in editing activity for high-profile games in anticipation of their release.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\nThe main challenge was accurately counting the number of Wikipedia revisions before the game's release date. Despite scrolling through the revision history, a clear count was not derived. This may be due to the complexity of navigating and filtering the revision data efficiently.\n---\n**New Plan:**\n- **Step 1:** Ask WebSurfer to revisit the Wikipedia page and access the full revision history for the \"God of War (2018 video game).\"\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to filter the revision history to show only entries before April 2018. Ensure detailed scrolling and filtering capabilities are used to access all early revisions.\n- **Step 3:** Count the number of revisions manually if WebSurfer cannot extract or summarize the revision total.\n- **Step 4:** Cross-verify the number if possible, utilizing page tools or any available Wikipedia statistics or history summaries.\n- **Hints:**\n  - Ensure that the display settings are showing all revisions (e.g., adjust the list to '500' revisions per page if needed).\n  - Double-check for any specific tools or filters on the Wikipedia revision history page that automatically summarize or count revisions."

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere is the updated fact sheet with new insights:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The video game \"God of War\" won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - \"God of War\" was released worldwide in April 2018 for the PlayStation 4.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Access the revision history of the \"God of War (2018 video game)\" Wikipedia page to count the number of revisions before April 2018.\n   - Confirm the exact date of \"God of War\" winning the British Academy Games Award in 2019 for documentation.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine the total number of Wikipedia revisions before April 2018 by analyzing the revision history available on Wikipedia.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" likely experienced heightened editing activity before April 2018, consistent with trends for high-profile games. This suggests numerous updates and revisions as new information and media coverage increased interest.\n   - Based on typical patterns observed on Wikipedia for popular media, it's reasonable to assume there were potentially dozens of revisions in the months leading up to the release.\n**Reasoning**: Given the ongoing challenges in accessing the page directly, it's important to focus efforts on direct interaction with the revision history tools and utilize page settings and filters optimally to ensure an accurate count.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\nThe main issue was navigating to the correct English Wikipedia page and accessing the revision history effectively. The repeated misinterpretation or distraction by other similar pages (different languages or versions) led to difficulties in achieving the task.\n---\n**New Plan:**\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to directly access the English Wikipedia page of \"God of War (2018 video game)\" by refining search terms to specify the English version.\n- **Step 2:** Navigate to the \"View History\" tab on the Wikipedia page. Ensure WebSurfer selects this option for the correct page.\n- **Step 3:** Adjust the settings to view the maximum number of revisions per page (e.g., 500), which will make counting easier.\n- **Step 4:** Filter the revisions to show only those before April 2018 by setting an appropriate date range.\n- **Step 5:** Count the total revisions either manually or by any available Wikipedia tools that summarize or provide statistics.\n---\n**Hints:**\n- Advise WebSurfer to search using specific keywords like \"God of War (2018 video game) English Wikipedia.\"\n- Emphasize using the \"View History\" function and adjusting view settings for optimal data extraction.\n- Ensure adequate filtering to accurately capture revisions before the desired date range, using Wikipedia’s built-in filters."

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are two protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature.
