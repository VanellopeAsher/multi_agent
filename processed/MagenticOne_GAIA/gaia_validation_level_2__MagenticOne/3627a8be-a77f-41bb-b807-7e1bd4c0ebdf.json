      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nThe object in the British Museum's collection with a museum number of 2012,5015.17 is the shell of a particular mollusk species. According to the abstract of a research article published in Science Advances in 2021, beads made from the shells of this species were found that are at least how many thousands of years old?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The British Museum's collection includes an object with the museum number 2012,5015.17, which is the shell of a particular mollusk species.\n   - A research article published in Science Advances in 2021 discusses beads made from the shells of this species.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific mollusk species associated with the British Museum object 2012,5015.17. This can be found through the British Museum's collection database or catalog.\n   - The abstract of the 2021 research article in Science Advances to determine how many thousands of years old the beads made from this mollusk species' shells are. This can be found on the Science Advances website or through a scientific journal database.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None specified; the request primarily involves looking up specific information.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Without looking up the information, it is reasonable to guess that the beads could be several tens of thousands of years old, considering the context of archaeological findings involving ancient beads and their significance in early human history.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for the British Museum's collection database to verify information about the object with the museum number 2012,5015.17 and identify the mollusk species associated with it.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for the abstract or relevant information from the 2021 research article published in Science Advances related to beads made from the mollusk species' shells. Specifically, find out how many thousands of years old the beads are stated to be.\n- **Assistant**: Compile and consolidate the information gathered into a comprehensive response to address the original request."

Their appearance signals important developments in both cognition and social relations. This paper describes and presents contextual information for 33 shell beads from Bizmoune Cave (southwest Morocco). Many of the beads come as deposits dating to ≥142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity.
