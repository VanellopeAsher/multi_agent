      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nAccording to Openreview.net, at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference, how many papers by an author named Yuri were accepted with a \"certain\" recommendation?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request pertains to the NeurIPS 2022 Conference.\n   - The query involves papers by an author named Yuri.\n   - The papers in question were accepted with a \"certain\" recommendation.\n   - Openreview.net is mentioned as a source.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The number of papers by an author named Yuri accepted at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference with a \"certain\" recommendation.\n   - Specific details on how a \"certain\" recommendation is categorized on Openreview.net.\n   - The list of authors and their papers accepted at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference, which can be found on Openreview.net.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The process of deriving the number of papers might involve searching for the name Yuri among the authors of accepted papers and identifying those papers with a \"certain\" recommendation, if such categorization is defined.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - \"Yuri\" could be a first name or a part of a longer name; multiple authors may fit this criterion.\n   - The term \"certain\" recommendation might refer to a strong or confident acceptance, but the exact definition would need to be confirmed on Openreview.net.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Instruct WebSurfer to visit Openreview.net and search for information about accepted papers at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference.\n- Ask WebSurfer to specifically look for papers authored by someone named Yuri and identify those papers that received a \"certain\" recommendation. Clarify what \"certain\" recommendation means if possible.\n- Request WebSurfer to compile a list of such papers, including the number of accepted ones matching the criteria.\n- Review the findings to confirm the details match the original query.\n- Provide the total count of papers that fulfill the requirement, alongside any relevant details about them."

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nHere's the updated fact sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request pertains to the NeurIPS 2022 Conference.\n   - The query involves papers by an author named Yuri.\n   - Openreview.net is mentioned as a source.\n   - Multiple papers by authors named Yuri were listed as accepted at NeurIPS 2022.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Clarification of what a \"certain\" recommendation means on OpenReview.net, as it is not immediately apparent in standard documentation or search results.\n   - Methods to contact or access FAQ for NeurIPS or OpenReview for further clarification on this recommendation type.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Identify if the \"certain\" recommendation is visible or identifiable on specific paper review pages or through author contacts.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - \"Certain\" recommendation might not be a formal category; it could refer to high confidence or a different phrasing in the peer review context.\n   - Further assistance could be obtained directly from NeurIPS or OpenReview's support or through their community forums.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\n- The key issue was the ambiguity around the term \"certain recommendation,\" which does not appear to be a standardized or easily identifiable category in NeurIPS or OpenReview documentation. This caused difficulty in verifying or finding papers fitting this categorization.\n**New Plan:**\n- **Clarify the Recommendation Term:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to explore NeurIPS FAQ sections and OpenReview guidelines for details on recommendation types, focusing on any terminology around acceptance or reviewer confidence.\n- **Direct Search for Papers:**\n  - WebSurfer should focus on finding accepted NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors named Yuri, even without specifying a \"certain\" recommendation.\n  - Explore any available metadata or paper details that might suggest a special recommendation or confidence score.\n- **Contact/FAQ Review:**\n  - Check if there is direct contact information or forums on NeurIPS or OpenReview where clarification about \"certain\" recommendation can be sought.\n- **Reassess and Adapt:**\n  - If \"certain\" is not defined, reassess the need for its strict definition, and consider reporting only on the papers by Yuri found without it.\nThis plan addresses the lack of clarity around \"certain\" and focuses on directly accessing available information while exploring additional support channels for clarification."
