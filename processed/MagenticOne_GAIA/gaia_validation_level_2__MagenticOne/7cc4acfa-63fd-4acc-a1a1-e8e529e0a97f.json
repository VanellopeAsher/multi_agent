Which city had the greater total sales: Wharvton or Algrimand?\nThe question is about a file, document or image, which can be accessed by the filename '7cc4acfa-63fd-4acc-a1a1-e8e529e0a97f.xlsx' in the current working directory.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves comparing total sales of menu items between the cities of Wharvton and Algrimand.\n   - The data is contained in a file named '7cc4acfa-63fd-4acc-a1a1-e8e529e0a97f.xlsx'.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The sales data for Wharvton and Algrimand needs to be looked up in the spreadsheet file provided.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The total sales figures for both Wharvton and Algrimand need to be calculated by summing up the sales data provided in the spreadsheet for each city.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It is reasonable to assume that the spreadsheet contains individual sales figures that can be summarized to obtain the total sales for each city.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **File Access**: Utilize FileSurfer to open and review the contents of the spreadsheet file '7cc4acfa-63fd-4acc-a1a1-e8e529e0a97f.xlsx' to understand its structure and find relevant sales data for Wharvton and Algrimand.\n- **Data Extraction**: Identify specific rows or columns in the spreadsheet that contain the sales data for each city. Extract this data for further analysis.\n- **Data Analysis**: Use either the Assistant's Python skills or the ComputerTerminal to calculate the total sales for Wharvton and Algrimand by summing their respective sales figures.\n- **Comparison**: Compare the total sales figures for Wharvton and Algrimand to determine which city had greater total sales.\n- **Report Findings**: Communicate the results, indicating which city had the greater total sales based on the calculated data."
