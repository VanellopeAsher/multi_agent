Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request asks about the first year Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock split.\n   - The source mentioned is Google Finance.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific year when Apple stock first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits would need to be looked up on a financial data platform like Google Finance.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Whether any stock splits occurred around the time the stock price first exceeded $50, to ensure accuracy regarding the non-adjustment for stock splits.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Apple Inc. has experienced significant stock price increases over the years, particularly after the release of major products like the iPhone. The stock likely crossed the $50 mark in the early 2000s, after Apple's resurgence with the success of products like the iPod and early iterations of the iPhone.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- Ask WebSurfer to access Google Finance or another reputable financial data source to look up the historical stock prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL).\n- Instruct WebSurfer to specifically find the year when Apple's stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- Once WebSurfer provides the relevant information, verify if the data aligns with historical events or trends known from Apple's history, such as major product launches or financial milestones.\n- Summarize the findings to provide a straightforward answer to the original request."
