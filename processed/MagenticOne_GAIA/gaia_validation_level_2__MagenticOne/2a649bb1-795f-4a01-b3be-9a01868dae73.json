Return the semicolon-separated numbers in the order of the alphabetized chemicals.\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request pertains to virus testing methods discussed in a 2016 paper about SPFMV (Sweet potato feathery mottle virus) and SPCSV (Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus) in the \"Pearl of Africa,\" which is a nickname for Uganda.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific 2016 paper discussing SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda needs to be identified.\n   - The chemicals used for virus testing in that paper.\n   - The EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers for those chemicals, which can typically be found in biochemistry or pharmacology resources, such as databases maintained by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) or in scientific articles.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine the two most commonly used chemicals for virus testing methods based on the given context.\n   - Alphabetize those chemicals to identify the correct order of EC numbers.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - \"Pearl of Africa\" likely indicates the region where the study was conducted, i.e., Uganda.\n   - The virus testing methods could involve common laboratory chemicals such as enzymes used in PCR or ELISA techniques, potentially making it possible to anticipate some commonly used chemicals like Taq polymerase or other reagents used in molecular diagnostics.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: Conduct a web search to identify the 2016 paper discussing SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda. Focus on finding the paper that includes information about virus testing methods and the chemicals used.\n- **WebSurfer**: Once the paper is found, locate the section about the virus testing methods. Identify the chemicals mentioned that are most commonly used in these methods.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for the EC numbers for those chemicals, focusing on reliable sources like the IUBMB database or related scientific articles.\n- **Assistant**: Alphabetize the identified chemicals and format the EC numbers in a semicolon-separated sequence as requested in the original task.\n- **Assistant**: Compile and present the final result once all necessary information has been gathered and processed."

Field plots planted with graft inoculated plants of virus-free cultivars Beauregard, Dimbuka, Ejumula, Kabode and NASPOT 1 were used to assess the effect of SPFMV and SPCSV on yield and quality of sweetpotatoes in two agro-ecologies. SPFMV spreads rapidly to control plots at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute Kabanyolo (MUARIK), and these plots had similar yields to those singly infected with SPFMV but at the National Semi Arid Resource Research Institute (NaSARRI) where SPFMV spreads slowly, plots infected with SPFMV yielded 40% less than the control. Recovery from SPFMV appeared to be more frequent at NaSARRI than at MUARIK. Infection by SPCSV alone resulted in yield losses of 14–52%, while mixed infections of SPFMV+SPCSV resulted in yield losses in both locations of 60–95% depending on the cultivar. SPCSV and mixed infections of SPFMV+SPCSV also reduced the number of roots formed as well as the diameter of the roots, resulting in a greater length to diameter ratio compared to the healthy control. This study, therefore, confirms that both SPFMV and SPCSV, both singly and when mixed, can reduce yield, the extent depending on the cultivar. To mitigate the effect of these viruses, farmers should use clean planting materials of resistant varieties.\nVolume164, Issue4April 2016\nPages 242-254Figures\nReferences\nRelated\nInformation\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"robots\": \"noarchive\",\n        \"description\": \"Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) are the most common viruses infecting sweetpotato in Uganda.

This study, therefore, confirms that both SPFMV and SPCSV, both singly and when mixed, can reduce yield, the extent depending on the cultivar. To mitigate the effect of these viruses, farmers should use clean planting materials of resistant varieties.\n Introduction\nSweetpotato is a vegetatively propagated crop, and systemic pathogens like viruses can persist and spread over successive crop cycles (Bryan et al. \n2003). Over 30 viruses belonging to potyvirus, crinivirus, carlavirus, cucumovirus, ipomovirus, badnavirus and begomovirus have been reported to infect sweetpotatoes worldwide (Mukasa et al. \n2006; Untiveros et al. \n2007; Valverde et al. \n2007; Clark et al. \n2012). Of these, only six have been reported in Uganda, namely \nSweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), \nSweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), \nSweet potato chlorotic flecks virus (SPCFV), \nSweet potato collusive virus (SPCV), \nSweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV) and \nSweet potato leaf curl Uganda virus (SPLCUV) (Gibson et al. \n1998; Mukasa et al. \n2003; Aritua et al. \n2007; Wasswa et al. \n2011). SPFMV and SPCSV are the most prevalent and when they co-infect, result in severe symptoms described as sweetpotato virus disease (SPVD) (Gibson et al. \n1998; Karyeija et al. \n2000; Mukasa et al. \n2006) causing up to 90% yield losses (Mukiibi \n1977; Karyeija et al. \n1998; Aritua et al. \n2000).\nDue to the severe yield losses caused by SPVD, most research in Africa including Uganda has concentrated on this, neglecting the occurrence as single infection with SPFMV and SPCSV. Plants affected by SPVD are easily recognizable by farmers due to the severe symptoms and may be controlled by combination of removal and not selecting them as planting material for the next crop (Aritua et al. \n1999). On the other hand, the impact of individual viruses which are usually symptomless and are therefore difficult for farmers to control has not been well studied. In addition, no field study has so far been carried out in Uganda to determine the effect of single virus infections on yield of sweetpotatoes. Studies in other countries on the effect of SPFMV on yield of sweetpotato cultivars are contradictory. Some studies have reported no effects on yield of storage roots and vines in comparison with healthy plants (Milgram et al. \n1996; Clark and Hoy \n2006), and other studies have reported SPFMV-infected plants producing better yield than the healthy control (Gutierrez et al. \n2003), while others have reported yield reduction of up to 46% (Gibson et al. \n1997; Mukasa \n2004; Njeru et al. \n2004; Domola et al. \n2008). Due to this contradictory evidence, there is a need to further investigate the effect of SPFMV on Ugandan sweetpotato cultivars to design an effective management system in Uganda.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

Due to this contradictory evidence, there is a need to further investigate the effect of SPFMV on Ugandan sweetpotato cultivars to design an effective management system in Uganda.\nAlso, single infection of SPCSV may produce clear symptoms in some cultivars, but farmers can confuse its symptoms with purpling of mature leaves due to nutrient deficiencies in the soil or plant maturity (Gibson et al. \n1997; Mukasa et al. \n2003). As a result, cuttings from such plants are used for subsequent propagation. Data on effects of single infection of SPCSV under field conditions in Uganda are also limited. However, SPCSV alone has been reported to cause a 30% yield reduction in cv Costanero, in Peru (Untiveros et al. \n2007). In Uganda, a yield reduction of 50% in cv Tanzania under screenhouse conditions was reported although the yield performances of both healthy plants and infected ones were poor (Gibson et al. \n1998; Mukasa et al. \n2006). Virus expression and its effect in plants is influenced by the environment, and hence, there is a need to determine the effect of virus under field conditions in contrasting agro-ecologies.\nContinued use of symptomless but infected cuttings by farmers in Uganda could also be a reason why the potential average yield has not been achieved. This study therefore aimed to determine the effects of single infection of SPFMV or SPCSV and their combination on the yield of four sweetpotato cultivars grown in Uganda under field conditions of two agro-ecologies.\n Materials and Methods\n Virus testing\nThree leaf samples (leaf disc of ~1 cm diameter) per plant were picked from the top, middle and bottom part of the plants and ground in a polyvinyl bag using appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) extraction buffer (1 ml buffer per leaf disc). The leaf samples were tested either using NCM ELISA or DAS and TAS ELISA. Nitrocellulose membrane ELISA was carried out following the protocol obtained from CIP Lima, Peru to detect the presence of any of the ten viruses, that is SPFMV, SPMMV, \nSweet potato latent virus (SPLV), SPCFV, \nSweet potato mild speckling virus (SPMSV), C-6 virus, SPCSV, SPCV, \nSweet potato virus G (SPVG) and \nCucumber mosaic virus (CMV) for which antibodies were available. The presence of virus was judged on the visual intensity of the colour change on the membrane. Additional tests using DAS and TAS ELISA were specifically carried out to detect and estimate the virus titre for SPFMV or SPCSV, respectively, using protocol by Clark and Adams (\n1977). The DAS-ELISA kit (containing coating antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG) and detecting antibody IgG-AP) against SPFMV and TAS ELISA kit containing (primary antibody, rabbit IgG, secondary mouse monoclonal antibody MAb and detection antibody, rabbit anti-mouse IgG-AP) against SPCSV and respective positive controls were from Leibniz-Institut DSMZ-Deutsche sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkuturen GmbH, Germany. The p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and microplates used were from Sigma Chemical Co. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm after one and half hours using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (model 680).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"
