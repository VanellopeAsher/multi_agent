Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request is referencing a 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com.\n   - The request is asking for the specific command clicked in a video to remove extra lines.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com.\n   - The content of the last video included in that blog post, particularly the command used to remove extra lines. This can be found by navigating to replit.com and searching for the specific blog post from 2018.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - If the specific command is not directly clear from the video, it may require understanding typical VSCode commands for editing, such as those used for trimming or cleaning up code, to make an educated deduction.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Common VSCode commands for removing extra lines might include keyboard shortcuts or built-in features like \"Trim Trailing Whitespace\" or \"Format Document.\"\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Step 1:** Ask WebSurfer to search for and locate the 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com. The goal is to find the specific blog that contains a video about VSCode.\n- **Step 2:** Once the blog post is located, WebSurfer should navigate to it and summarize or describe the content of the page, particularly focusing on any videos present within the post.\n- **Step 3:** If a video is found, WebSurfer should attempt to determine the command clicked on in the last video to remove extra lines, by watching the video or reading any accompanying descriptions or transcripts.\n- **Step 4:** If WebSurfer finds the needed information, provide it as the answer. If there is any confusion or WebSurfer cannot access the video content properly, consider making an educated guess based on typical VSCode functionalities related to removing extra lines."

When we starte...\nLe persone hanno chiesto anche\nIs VSCode a good package?\nIt’s too intertwined with the rest of the VSCode codebase, and the package itself is almost like an afterthought. Even the VSCode codebase is not particularly great itself, it’s probably one of the oldest TypeScript project out there, and it’s written in enterprise Microsoft fashion.Ace, CodeMirror, and Monaco: A Comparison of the Code Editors You U…blog.replit.com\nWhat happened to VSCode API?\nOverall, the API started to feel outdated and clunky. The maintainer is great, but there’s only so much he can do. As you might know, Monaco is the editor that powers VSCode; in fact, Microsoft built VSCode around Monaco. If we switch to Monaco, we thought we’d be able to get all the cool updates and features from the good folks working on VSCode.Ace, CodeMirror, and Monaco: A Comparison of the Code Editors You U…blog.replit.com\nIs VS Code based on LSP?\nIn addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: Monaco. Monaco is an editor built with web technologies, and since we started looking at LSP a few months ago, it only made sense for us to transition to Monaco first.Replit — Zero Setup VSCode Intelligenceblog.replit.com\nWhat's wrong with Monaco VSCode?\nThe first issue was that there were a lot of languages modes missing from Monaco; even though VSCode had them, they relied on running in Nodejs/Electron and not the browser. So we started writing language modes for Monaco and contributing back to the project. We added Scala, Julia, Scheme, Clojure, and fixed bugs with various languages like Python.Ace, CodeMirror, and Monaco: A Comparison of the Code Editors You U…blog.replit.com\nFeedbackReplit\nhttps://replit.com › theme › vs-code-dark\nVS Code Dark - Replit\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"SystemEntropyOriginTrialToken\": \"A5is4nwJJVnhaJpUr1URgj4vvAXSiHoK0VBbM9fawMskbDUj9WUREpa3JzGAo6xd1Cp2voQEG1h6NQ71AsMznU8AAABxeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW5nLmNvbTo0NDMiLCJmZWF0dXJlIjoiTXNVc2VyQWdlbnRMYXVuY2hOYXZUeXBlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzUzNzQ3MjAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Grazie alla ricerca intelligente di Bing puoi trovare ci\\u00f2 che cerchi in modo semplice e rapido accumulando punti.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Bing\",\n        \"og:title\": \"2018 VSCode blog post site:replit.com - Bing\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=2018+VSCode+blog+post+site%3Areplit.com&FORM=QBLH&rdr=1&rdrig=365F578BF48B42E6A6AE38FA3CE6DE5F\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"3732605936979161\",\n        \"og:image\": \"http://www.bing.com/sa/simg/facebook_sharing_5.png\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"600\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"315\"\n    }\n}\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"

When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.\nHowever, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced \n\"A Common Protocol for Languages\", a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol — this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" \n(LSP).\nIn addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: \nMonaco. Monaco is an editor built with web technologies, and since we started looking at LSP a few months ago, it only made sense for us to transition to Monaco first. Even before the introduction of LSP on Repl.it, Monaco allowed us to provide some cool language features (Smart Autocomplete, Go to Definition, Find References) for TypeScript and JavaScript because they're bundled with the editor.

When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.\nHowever, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced \n\"A Common Protocol for Languages\", a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol — this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" \n(LSP).\nIn addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: \nMonaco. Monaco is an editor built with web technologies, and since we started looking at LSP a few months ago, it only made sense for us to transition to Monaco first. Even before the introduction of LSP on Repl.it, Monaco allowed us to provide some cool language features (Smart Autocomplete, Go to Definition, Find References) for TypeScript and JavaScript because they're bundled with the editor.

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn the 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com, what was the command they clicked on in the last video to remove extra lines?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nUpdated Fact Sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request references a 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com.\n   - The blog post titled \"Zero Setup VSCode Intelligence\" is published on Replit's blog.\n   - The request asks for the specific command clicked in a video to remove extra lines.\n   - The blog post emphasizes VSCode features, likely involving the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and Monaco editor.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Search for any embedded video content in the blog post, targeting the command used to remove extra lines.\n   - Look for visual cues in the video that demonstrate the command palette or other interface elements.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which VSCode features are likely demonstrated, especially those related to formatting or editing code.\n   - Identify any specific functionality related to cleaning up code that may be referenced or shown in the video.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Common VSCode commands for removing extra lines might include:\n     - \"Trim Trailing Whitespace\" or \"Format Document\" accessible via keyboard shortcuts or the command palette.\n   - Given the emphasis on Monaco editor and LSP, similar commands might be demonstrated to enhance code cleanliness.\n   - The video likely shows a command using VSCode's command palette, possibly focusing on formatting tools.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**What Went Wrong:**\nThe main issue was difficulty in accessing and directly identifying the specific video in the Replit blog post. It seems the page navigation did not successfully locate or open the blog post with the necessary video content. There might have been a misunderstanding in accessing the correct link or navigating the page content.\n**New Plan:**\n- **Step 1:** Open the \"Zero Setup VSCode Intelligence\" blog post directly, confirming access to the correct page.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to perform a targeted search for any video content within the blog post, watching for play buttons or video markers.\n- **Step 3:** If video content is found, review the content to identify any specific command clicked to remove extra lines, noting any visual cues like command palette use.\n- **Step 4:** If there are difficulties in finding the video, use in-page search functionality to search for keywords like \"video\" or \"lines\" to locate relevant content more effectively.\n- **Step 5:** Document specific commands or features shown, especially those demonstrating code formatting or cleansing functions such as removing extra lines."

When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.\nHowever, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced \n\"A Common Protocol for Languages\", a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol — this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" \n(LSP).\nIn addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: \nMonaco. Monaco is an editor built with web technologies, and since we started looking at LSP a few months ago, it only made sense for us to transition to Monaco first. Even before the introduction of LSP on Repl.it, Monaco allowed us to provide some cool language features (Smart Autocomplete, Go to Definition, Find References) for TypeScript and JavaScript because they're bundled with the editor. On top of that, the editor has a slick feel to it.\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"description\": \"At Repl.it our goal is to provide state of the art in developer tools to everyone in the world, for free.

      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nIn the 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com, what was the command they clicked on in the last video to remove extra lines?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\nUpdated Fact Sheet:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request references a 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com.\n   - The blog post titled \"Zero Setup VSCode Intelligence\" is published on Replit's blog.\n   - The request asks for the specific command clicked in a video to remove extra lines.\n   - The blog post discusses VSCode features, emphasizing the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and Monaco editor.\n   - The blog post page with video content has been successfully accessed.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Examine the blog post for embedded video content demonstrating the use of commands to remove extra lines.\n   - Identify any specific video elements showing the use of the command palette or code editing features.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determine which VSCode features related to formatting or cleaning up code might be highlighted in any videos.\n   - Identify any clear demonstration of commands removing extra lines, such as those involving the command palette.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Likely commands for removing extra lines could include:\n     - \"Trim Trailing Whitespace\" or \"Format Document,\" commonly used for cleaning up code.\n   - The emphasis on Monaco and VSCode features suggests related formatting commands might be demonstrated.\n   - The video may likely feature visual cues for using formatting tools via the command palette to streamline code.\nReasoning: The emphasis on LSP and Monaco indicates a focus on enhanced editing features, aligning with common VSCode document formatting commands.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n**What Went Wrong:**\nThe key issue was not successfully navigating to and interacting with the specific video content on the Replit blog page to find the command used to remove extra lines. The process got stuck on browser navigation and cookie interaction, preventing progress to viewing the video's content.\n**New Plan:**\n- **Step 1:** Ensure the web page is fully loaded and visually inspect the page to find any embedded video content.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to interact with the video, playing it to identify any commands demonstrated for removing extra lines.\n- **Step 3:** Specifically look for context clues around the video, such as headings or captions, that might indicate relevant sequences or tools being showcased.\n- **Step 4:** If difficulties arise in interpreting video content, try searching the text content nearby for possible descriptions or summaries of the video demonstrations.\n- **Step 5:** Document any findings clearly, focusing on commands related to formatting or removing extra lines through the command palette or similar tools. \nThese steps aim to overcome navigation issues and focus on direct interaction and interpretation of content displayed on the blog page."
