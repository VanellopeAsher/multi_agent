Subtract the smaller number from the larger number, then return the difference in thousands of women. So if there were 30.1 thousand more men, you'd give \"30.1\"\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves data from the 2011 Bulgarian census.\n   - The focus is on the gender split of those who have completed tertiary education.\n   - The task involves calculating the difference between the numbers of men and women who have completed tertiary education.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific numbers of men and women who completed tertiary education according to the 2011 Bulgarian census. This data would typically be found in official census reports published by the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria or other related government publications.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The difference between the number of men and women who have completed tertiary education in Bulgaria as per the 2011 census.\n   - The conversion of this difference into thousands of women if women are the gender with fewer graduates.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Typically, in many countries, more women complete tertiary education than men, but specific data must be verified for Bulgaria in 2011.\n   - The data needed might be accessible through online databases or libraries with statistical data records from international educational or demographical databases.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- WebSurfer: Conduct a web search to find the official statistics from the 2011 Bulgarian census regarding the gender split of those who have completed tertiary education. Look for credible sources such as the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria or other reputable educational and governmental databases.\n- WebSurfer: Once the relevant page is found, extract the data regarding the number of men and women who have completed tertiary education.\n- Assistant: With the gathered data, calculate the difference between the number of men and women who have completed tertiary education.\n- Assistant: Convert the difference into thousands of women, ensuring that if there are more women, the result is still expressed in terms of women.
