      "content": "Let's create a Python script that will use `pytesseract` and `PIL` to perform OCR on the image. We'll preprocess the image by converting it to grayscale and enhancing the contrast to improve text extraction results.\nHere is the complete Python script:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageOps\nimport pytesseract\n# Path to the image file\nimage_path = \"6359a0b1-8f7b-499b-9336-840f9ab90688.png\"\n# Open the image with PIL\nimg = Image.open(image_path)\n# Convert the image to grayscale\nimg_gray = ImageOps.grayscale(img)\n# Enhance the contrast of the image\nenhancer = ImageEnhance.Contrast(img_gray)\nimg_contrast = enhancer.enhance(2)  # You can adjust the factor (e.g., 2) to increase/decrease contrast\n# Use pytesseract to perform OCR on the processed image\nextracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img_contrast)\n# Print the extracted text\nprint(\"Extracted Text from Image:\")\nprint(extracted_text)\n```\n### Instructions:\n1. Make sure you have `pytesseract`, `PIL` (from `Pillow`), and Tesseract OCR installed in your Python environment.\n2. Run this script in your terminal or any Python environment that supports the necessary packages.\n3. The script will print out the text extracted from the image, which should contain the side lengths in purple.\nThis OCR output will help identify the lengths of the sides of the green polygon in the image. Once we have these values, we can proceed to calculate the area of the polygon."
