Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - A formula is provided: Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4097 - C\n   - The expression involves constants A, L, and C.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence to find L (the last two digits of that year).\n   - The number of colors in the TikTok logo as of July 2023, excluding black and white, to determine A.\n   - The average height of a woman in the Philippines according to a July 2023 Business Insider article, rounded to the nearest whole centimeter, to determine C.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The derivative d/dx * (A * x-squared), which is a straightforward calculus operation based on A.\n   - Solve the equation to find the value of x to the nearest tenth.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The Venezuelan Declaration of Independence likely took place in the early 1800s, so the last two digits (L) may be in that range.\n   - The TikTok logo typically has a small number of distinct colors, possibly around 2 or 3, when excluding black and white.\n   - The average height of a woman in the Philippines might be around 150-160 centimeters based on general knowledge about average heights in Southeast Asia.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **WebSurfer**: \n  - Look up the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence to determine the last two digits (L).\n  - Find information on the number of colors in the TikTok logo as of July 2023, excluding black and white (A).\n  - Locate the average height of women in the Philippines according to a July 2023 Business Insider article, rounded to the nearest centimeter (C).\n- **Assistant**: \n  - Once WebSurfer provides the necessary data, substitute the values into the formula.\n  - Compute the derivative (d/dx) of the expression \\( A \\cdot x^2 \\).\n  - Solve the equation \\( Lx = (d/dx \\cdot (A \\cdot x^2)) + 4097 - C \\) for the value of x to the nearest tenth."
