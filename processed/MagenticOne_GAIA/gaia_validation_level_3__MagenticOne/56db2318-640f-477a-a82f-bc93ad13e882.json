Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The numbers provided function similarly to ISBN-13 numbers.\n   - The checksum digit is calculated using alternating weights of 1 and another positive integer less than 10.\n   - There is an error in the data involving two transposed adjacent columns.\n   - These transposed columns are not among the final column or the first three columns.\n   - The numbers provided are: \n     - 978-354181391-9\n     - 978-946669746-1\n     - 978-398036139-6\n     - 978-447656680-4\n     - 978-279586664-7\n     - 978-595073693-3\n     - 978-976647652-6\n     - 978-591178125-5\n     - 978-728465924-5\n     - 978-414825155-9\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Specifics of the ISBN-13 checksum validation method if needed for comparison or deeper understanding.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The unknown weight used in the checksum calculation.\n   - The specific columns that have been transposed, limited to the set of columns that do not include the final or the first three columns.\n   - All potential solutions in the form of x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The weight could be a small integer like 2, 4, 5, etc., based on conventional choices for checksum calculations.\n   - The transposed columns are likely adjacent columns within the middle segment of the number, given that the error does not involve the borders defined by the problem statement.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\nHere is a short bullet-point plan to address the original request:\n1. **Analyze ISBN-like Numbers:**\n   - Use the given numbers and the modified ISBN checksum method to identify potential transpositions and correct checksum calculations.\n2. **Calculate Possible Weights:**\n   - Iterate over possible weights (from 2 to 9, given the constraints) and use these in the modified checksum calculation.\n3. **Identify Transposed Columns:**\n   - For each possible weight, simulate the transposition of adjacent columns not including the final column or the first three columns.\n   - Check if the modified numbers yield valid checksums using these simulated transpositions.\n4. **Script Development and Execution:**\n   - Develop a Python script to automate the above calculations and checks.\n   - Run the Python script using the ComputerTerminal to determine all valid (weight, index) pairs for which the ISBN-like numbers meet the checksum condition.\n5. **Compile Solutions:**\n   - Gather all potential solutions in the form (x, y) where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the transposed columns.\nExecuting this plan should yield the desired solution set. We will use the ComputerTerminal primarily for computation tasks, and FileSurfer may be used if file operations are required for any reason. Other team members may not be necessary for this request."
