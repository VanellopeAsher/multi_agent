      "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\nA 5-man group made up of one tank, one healer, and three DPS is doing a dungeon that was just released in World of Warcraft. Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it. If all classes were using their class abilities and all classes are unique, what are the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas?\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The group consists of five players: one tank, one healer, and three DPS.\n- There are two plate wearers and two cloth wearers in the group.\n- Both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells.\n- Ice and fire are being used, each by a different DPS.\n- A bear from the group is attacking the boss.\n- Metamorphosis is cast during the fight.\n- The item \"Kilt of the Forgotten One\" drops as loot, but no one can use it.\n- All classes are using their class abilities.\n- All classes are unique in the group.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Information on World of Warcraft classes and their capabilities, such as which classes can cast holy spells, use metamorphosis, and utilize fire or ice abilities. This can be looked up in the World of Warcraft official class guides or reputable fan sites like Wowhead or Icy Veins.\n- Details about the \"Kilt of the Forgotten One,\" such as which class it is intended for, which could also be found on Wowhead or similar sites.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determine the classes of the players by logical deduction based on the given facts and known capabilities of World of Warcraft classes, keeping in mind the specific roles and abilities mentioned.\n- Deduce which class corresponds to the bear, which class can use metamorphosis, and which can wield ice or fire spells.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The classes using holy spells are likely to be Paladin or Priest, as these are known for casting holy spells in the game.\n- The class that can metamorphosize is likely a Demon Hunter or Warlock, since Warlocks have a similar ability and Demon Hunters can undergo metamorphosis.\n- The bear form is likely a Druid, as Druids can shapeshift into bear form.\n- The Kilt of the Forgotten One may likely be for a class not represented in the group, potentially Shaman or another cloth wearer.\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\nHere is a plan to address the request using the available team members:\n- **Step 1**: Use the Assistant to recall general knowledge about World of Warcraft classes and their capabilities, specifically focusing on which classes can wear plate or cloth, cast holy spells, shapeshift into a bear, use ice/fire spells, or undergo metamorphosis.\n- **Step 2**: Involve WebSurfer to look up details about the \"Kilt of the Forgotten One\" to identify which class it is intended for. This will help ensure that we know why no one in the group can use it.\n- **Step 3**: Using the synthesized information from the above steps, the Assistant can derive the unique classes in the group based on the roles, spell types, gear wear restrictions, and abilities described in the scenario.\n- **Step 4**: Verify the list of identified classes with known World of Warcraft class guides to ensure accuracy.\nThis plan allows us to systematically deduce and verify the class composition of the group that matches the given scenarios."

Druids wear leather armor.\n4. **Holy Spells:**\n   - **Paladin:** Casts holy spells and can wear plate.\n   - **Priest:** Casts holy spells and wears cloth.\n5. **Metamorphosis:**\n   - **Demon Hunter:** Has an ability called Metamorphosis, mainly used in DPS and tank specs, wears leather.\n   - **Warlock:** Has a spell called \"Demonology Metamorphosis\" in some expansions, wears cloth.\n6. **Fire and Ice Spells:**\n   - **Mage:** Specializes in Fire and Frost spells.\nTo further determine which classes are present in the group, let's verify the details of the \"Kilt of the Forgotten One\" to identify its intended class and see why no one in the group can use it. I'll now involve WebSurfer to look up the details about this item."

But considering all classes are distinct and no one can use the kilt (leather), it points towards Warlock.\n5. **Kilt of the Forgotten One:**\n   - Identified as leather armor. Since no one can use it, it suggests no Druids, Demon Hunters, Rogues, or Monks are present, in terms of leather-wearing classes.\nGiven this deduction:\n- **Tank:** Paladin (plate, holy spells)\n- **Healer:** Priest (cloth, holy spells)\n- **DPS 1:** Mage (cloth, fire/ice spells)\n- **DPS 2:** Warlock (cloth, metamorphosis)\n- **DPS 3:** Druid (bear form for attacking, but cannot use leather loot)\n**Final Answer:** Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Warlock"
