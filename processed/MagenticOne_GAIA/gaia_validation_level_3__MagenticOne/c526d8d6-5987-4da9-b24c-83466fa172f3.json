Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves calculating the velocity of a reaction using the final equation in the original 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper.\n   - The specific reaction data to use is from \"Reaction 7\" in the provided Excel file.\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific details of the final equation in the original 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper.\n   - The NIH translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper if not already in possession.\n   - Details about the structure and content of the Excel file named 'c526d8d6-5987-4da9-b24c-83466fa172f3.xlsx', which may require using Excel or compatible software to access.\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The specific numerical values required from \"Reaction 7\" in the Excel file to use in the Michaelis-Menten equation.\n   - Calculation of the reaction velocity to four decimal places using the derived data and the Michaelis-Menten equation.\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The Excel file likely includes data such as substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, and other parameters relevant to enzyme kinetics.\n   - The final equation in the 1913 paper is the Michaelis-Menten equation, which typically involves parameters such as Vmax (maximum velocity) and Km (Michaelis constant).\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n- **Step 1:** Use FileSurfer to open the Excel file 'c526d8d6-5987-4da9-b24c-83466fa172f3.xlsx' and extract the relevant data for \"Reaction 7.\"\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to find the NIH translation of the original 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper and retrieve the final equation.\n- **Step 3:** Derive the necessary parameters from the extracted Reaction 7 data and the equation retrieved to identify values such as substrate concentration, Vmax, and Km.\n- **Step 4:** Use ComputerTerminal to perform the necessary calculations using Python with the derived parameters to compute the reaction velocity to four decimal places.\n- **Step 5:** Compile the results and provide the calculated velocity as the final output."

In their analysis, Michaelis and Menten developed the now-classic equation for reaction velocity, which is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex. They initially described the enzyme kinetics through a constant term (*C*), converting it to the modern terms where *C = Vmax* and the reaction velocity is described as *v = (Vmax[S])/(Km + [S])*; here, *Km* is the Michaelis constant. Their work also incorporated product inhibition into their analysis by using the integrated form of the rate equations, a pioneering approach that allowed them to derive a global constant, then described as *Vmax/Km*, now known as the specificity constant, multiplied by enzyme concentration.\nUltimately, the analysis by Michaelis and Menten was not limited to deriving the Michaelis constant (*Km*) but extended to understanding the specificity constant (*kcat/Km*). They calculated the constant *C/KS* as a means to normalize their data globally, which today corresponds to a combination of kinetic parameters that describe enzyme efficiency. Their work set a foundational standard for kinetic research and highlighted their significant contribution to the evolution of enzymology as a scientific discipline."
