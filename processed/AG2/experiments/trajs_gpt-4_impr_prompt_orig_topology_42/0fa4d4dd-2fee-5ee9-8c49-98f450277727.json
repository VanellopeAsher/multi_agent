Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?"

      "content": "The first step to solving this problem is to calculate how much money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes. Once we know this, we can subtract what Sara has already earned through babysitting and what she already had saved up. This will tell us how much more she needs.\n\nAfter that, we need to determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn at $10 each time to earn this remaining amount.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes.\n2. Subtract from this total the money Sarah already has. This includes the money she made from babysitting and the money she had saved up.\n3. Divide the remainder by the amount Sara earns each time she mows the lawn to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn.\n\nLet's calculate now.\n\n```python\n# cost of items she wants to buy\nprice_jacket = 120\nprice_shoe = 100\nnum_shoes = 2\n\n# money before babysitting\nmoney_saved = 100\n\n# babysitting details\ntimes_babysitting = 10\npay_babysitting = 5\n\n# money earned babysitting\nmoney_babysitting = times_babysitting * pay_babysitting\n\n# money needed before mowing\nmoney_needed = price_jacket + price_shoe * num_shoes\n\n# remaining money needed after subtracting babysitting money and saved money\nmoney_remain = money_needed - money_babysitting - money_saved\n\n# cost per lawn mowing\npay_mowing = 10\n\n# number of times she needs to mow the lawn\ntimes_mowing = money_remain // pay_mowing\n\nif money_remain % pay_mowing > 0:\n    # if there's a remainder, she needs to mow one more time\n    times_mowing += 1\n\nprint(times_mowing)\n```\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of lawnmowing times Sara needs before she can afford all the items she wants. The code also considers situations where she doesn't earn a whole multiple of the lawnmowing pay, meaning she would still need to mow the lawn one more time to reach the amount she needs."

      "content": "After running the provided Python code, you should obtain the result that Sara needs to mow the lawn 17 times in order to afford the jacket and the 2 pairs of shoes. \n\nTo validate this result further, let's go through the calculations:\n\n1. Sara needs a total of $(120 + 2*100) = $320 to buy the jacket and shoes.\n2. She already earned $50 by babysitting 10 times and she had $100 saved up.\n3. Therefore, she needs an additional $(320 - (100+50)) = $170.\n4. As she is paid $10 each time she mows the lawn, you would divide the needed amount by how much she makes per task, that's how you obtain $170 รท $10 = 17 times\n\nTherefore, your answer of 17 times is correct! So, the final answer is \\boxed{17}. Excellent!"
