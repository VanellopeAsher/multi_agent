Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

After 2 months, he gains an additional $0.50/hour, and after a year he gains an additional $1.00/hour. This result can be computed using Python.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Sally's rate per hour after 2 months\nSally's starting rate is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's, so she starts at $10.50/hour. After two months, she gains an additional $0.50/hour. This can also be computed using Python.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the amount each earns after working 20 hours\nWe can multiply their rate per hour after the respective periods of their employment by the number of hours worked to obtain their earnings.\n\nStep 4: Subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's to find the difference\nBy subtracting Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings, we can find how much more Billy earns than Sally.\n\nLet's start with Step 1 and write Python code to carry out these computations."
