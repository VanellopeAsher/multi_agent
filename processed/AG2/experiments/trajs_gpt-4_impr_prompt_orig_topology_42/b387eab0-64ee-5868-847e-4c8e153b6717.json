Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon. An app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon if you fill up at this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, and they have a coupon that offers a 10% discount on the total price after cashback, how much will they pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon?"

This is the price per gallon times the number of gallons.\n2. Second, calculate the cashback amount. This is the cashback per gallon times the number of gallons.\n3. Subtract the cashback amount from the original price to get the price after cashback.\n4. Apply the coupon discount to the price after cashback. \n\nNow I'll write the Python code to do these calculations. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n#initialize values\nprice_per_gallon = 3.00\ncashback_per_gallon = 0.20\ndiscount = 0.10\ngallons = 10\n\n# calculate total price before cashback and discount\ntotal_price = price_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# calculate total cashback\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# calculate price after cashback\nprice_after_cashback = total_price - total_cashback\n\n# calculate price after discount\nfinal_price = price_after_cashback * (1 - discount)\n\nprint(final_price)\n```"
