Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards. There is a total of 447 cards. Becca has 15 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards that PJ has. How many cards does Becca have?"

B = S + 15\n2. S = 4P\n3. B + S + P = 447\n\nWe can solve these equations sequentially. \n\nLet's solve the equations in a step-by-step process.\n\n1. Use the second equation to express S in terms of P: S = 4P.\n2. Substitute S from step 1 into the first equation to express B in terms of P: B = 4P + 15.\n3. Substitute S and B from steps 1 and 2 into the third equation and solve this equation for P.\n4. Substitute the found P into the first two equations to find B and S.\n\nNow, we will proceed with the calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the variables\nP, S, B = symbols('P S B')\n\n# write the equations\nequation1 = Eq(B, S + 15)\nequation2 = Eq(S, 4*P)\nequation3 = Eq(B + S + P, 447)\n\n# solve the second equation for S\nS = solve(equation2, S)[0]\n\n# substitute S from equation2 into equation1\nequation1_subs = equation1.subs(S, 4*P)\n\n# solve the first equation for B\nB = solve(equation1_subs, B)[0]\n\n# substitute S and B from equations1 and 2 into equation3\nequation3_subs = equation3.subs({S: 4*P, B: 4*P + 15})\n\n# solve equation3 for P\nP_sol = solve(equation3_subs, P)[0]\n\n# substitute P into equations1 and 2 to find B and S\nB_sol = B.subs(P, P_sol)\nS_sol = S.subs(P, P_sol)\n\nB_sol\n```\nLet's solve these calculations."
