Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany.

Identify the total number of flights made by the first aircraft by using the information on the second aircraft.\n2. Determine the share of flights made by the first aircraft to countries other than Greece.\n3. Calculate the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France.\n\nStep 2: Execution of Calculations\n\nLet's start with the first step and calculate the total number of flights made by the first aircraft. Since the 44 flights made by the second aircraft represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day, the first aircraft's total daily flights are 44 * 2 = 88.\n\nNext, we know that the first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, so the remaining one-fourth, or 88 / 4 = 22 flights, are divided between France and Germany.\n\nFinally, the number of daily flights to France is equal to the number of flights to Germany, which is 22 / 2. \n\nLet's compute these in Python now."

We identified the total number of flights run by the first aircraft, which is twice the number of flights by the second aircraft. So, 44 * 2 = 88 total flights by the first aircraft are absolutely correct.\n2. We determined that three-fourths of these flights were to Greece, leaving one-fourth, or 22 flights, for France and Germany. This calculation also appears to be correct.\n3. We knew that these 22 flights were evenly split between France and Germany, so the 11 flights to France we calculated are accurate.\n\nOur final answer, therefore, is that the first aircraft makes $\\boxed{11}$ flights daily to France."
