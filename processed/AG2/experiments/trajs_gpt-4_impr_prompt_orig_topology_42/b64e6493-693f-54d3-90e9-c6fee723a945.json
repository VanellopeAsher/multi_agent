Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nColby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 80 quarters, 60 dimes, 140 nickels, and 150 pennies, how many can he buy?"

We started with 80 quarters, 60 dimes, 140 nickels, and 150 pennies for Colby.\n2. We converted all the coins into nickels because that's the price of each gumball. \n   - 1 quarter = 5 nickels, so Colby has 400 nickels from his quarters.\n   - 1 dime = 2 nickels, so Colby has 120 nickels from his dimes.\n   - He already has 140 nickels.\n   - 1 penny = 0.05 nickel, so Colby has 7.5 nickels from his pennies.\n3. When we added all these up, it came out to 667.5 nickels.\n4. We can't get a half gumball, so we round down to the nearest whole number.\n5. The final number of gumballs Colby can buy is 667, which checks out."
