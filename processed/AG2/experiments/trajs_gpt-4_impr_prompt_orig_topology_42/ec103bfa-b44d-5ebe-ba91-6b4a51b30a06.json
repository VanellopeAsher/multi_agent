Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $900. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $57?"

      "content": "First, we need to calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples. Then, we should subtract this from the total amount Marie paid to find out how much she spent on pizzas. Since we know the cost of each pizza box, we can use this information to find the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered.\n\nHere is the calculation approach using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of each item\ncost_of_chicken_meal = 120\ncost_of_milk_pack = 30\ncost_of_apple = 1.50\ncost_of_pizza_box = 57\n\n# Define the quantity of each item\nquantity_of_milk_packs = 5\nquantity_of_apples = 40\n\n# Calculate the total cost of milk packs and apples\ntotal_cost_of_milk_packs = cost_of_milk_pack * quantity_of_milk_packs\ntotal_cost_of_apples = cost_of_apple * quantity_of_apples\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs and apples\ntotal_cost_of_items_without_pizza = cost_of_chicken_meal + total_cost_of_milk_packs + total_cost_of_apples\n\n# Define the total amount Marie paid\ntotal_amount_paid = 900\n\n# Calculate the cost of pizza boxes\ncost_of_pizza_boxes = total_amount_paid - total_cost_of_items_without_pizza\n\n# Calculate the quantity of pizza boxes\nquantity_of_pizza_boxes = cost_of_pizza_boxes / cost_of_pizza_box\n\n# Display the quantity of pizza boxes\nprint(quantity_of_pizza_boxes)\n```\n\nBy running this Python program, we can determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered. Let's move forward with this calculation."

      "content": "The result indicates that Marie ordered 10 boxes of pizza.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Let's resume our calculation using the result of 10 boxes of pizza to see if we arrive at the total amount of $900 that Marie paid.\n\n2. The sum of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is calculated as follows: \nChicken meal: $120\nMilk: 5 * $30 = $150\nApples: 40 * $1.50 = $60\nTotal = $120 + $150 + $60 = $330 \n\n3. Now, let's figure out the total cost of the pizza.\nPizza: 10 boxes * $57/box = $570\n\n4. The total expenditure would then be:\nTotal = cost of items without pizza + cost of pizza \nTotal = $330 + $570 = $900 \n\nThis matches the amount that Marie paid, and further verifies the original calculation that Marie ordered \\boxed{10} boxes of pizza."
