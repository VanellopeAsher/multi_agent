      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours. He then works double that duration on Wednesday. On Thursday, he puts in 2 hours less than his Wednesday's work hours. What is the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days?"

      "content": "The key idea to this problem is to understand how time duration on one day influences the time duration on other days for using it to calculate the total hours worked. \n\nLet's follow a step-by-step process to solve this problem.\n\nStep 1: Calculate Wednesday's work hours. Bruce works double the duration of Tuesday's hours on Wednesday. Therefore, the work hours on Wednesday can be computed as 2 * Tuesday's hours.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Thursday's work hours. On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than he does on Wednesday. So the work hours on Thursday can be computed as Wednesday's hours - 2.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total hours. The total hours that Bruce has worked over these three days can be calculated by adding the work hours for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n\nLet's start coding these steps using Python."

Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday, twice that on Wednesday (so 10 hours), and 2 hours less than Wednesday's hours on Thursday (so 8 hours).\n\nStep 2: Confirm the calculated total hours. Adding up these hours gives us 23 (which is 5 hours on Tuesday + 10 hours on Wednesday + 8 hours on Thursday).\n\nAs both the workings for each day and the total calculation match our expectations from the problem statement, we can be confident that our calculation is correct. \n\nFinal Result:\nTherefore, Bruce has worked a total of \\boxed{23} hours over these three days."
