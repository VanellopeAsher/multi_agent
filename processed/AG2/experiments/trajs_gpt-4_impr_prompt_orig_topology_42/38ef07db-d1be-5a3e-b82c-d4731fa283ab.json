Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20.5 feet on the long side and 15.5 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?"

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: \n\nThis is a case for a Direct Python Solution. James needs to cover the entire fence with crepe-paper streamers, which implies he needs to account for both the length and the width (twice each since a rectangle has two equal long sides and two equal short sides). Therefore, the crepe paper required would be equal to the perimeter of the rectangular fence. \n\nPerimeter of a rectangle = 2*(length + width)  \n\nLet's compute this using Python.\n\n```python\nlength = 20.5\nwidth = 15.5\n\n# calculate the perimeter\npaper_needed = 2 * (length + width)\n\nprint(paper_needed)\n```"

      "content": "I have already reached the solution. To recap, James has a rectangular backyard fence and he wants to cover all edges of it with crepe-paper streamers.\n\nWe calculated the total length of crepe-paper required by finding the perimeter of the rectangle (same as the total length of the fence) using the formula:\n\nPerimeter of a rectangle = 2*(length + width)\n\nSubstituting length = 20.5 feet and width = 15.5 feet into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (20.5 + 15.5) = 72.0 feet.\n\nHence, the answer to the problem is that James needs to buy \\boxed{72.0} feet of crepe paper to cover his backyard fence."
