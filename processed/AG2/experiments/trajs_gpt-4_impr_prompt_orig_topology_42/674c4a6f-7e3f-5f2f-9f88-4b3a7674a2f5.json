Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class. His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores. On those tests, he received: 70, 95, 88, 90 and 78. What is his current math grade?"

The solution involves using Python to calculate the average of the 5 given test scores.\n\n```python\n# List of scores\nscores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Average score\naverage_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)\n\n# Output\nprint(average_score)\n```\n\nThis piece of code works by summing all the elements in the array `scores`, then dividing by the size of the array to find the average. Finally, it prints the average score."

The `Fraction` class takes two arguments: the numerator and the denominator of the fraction. Then it simplifies the fraction to its lowest terms."
