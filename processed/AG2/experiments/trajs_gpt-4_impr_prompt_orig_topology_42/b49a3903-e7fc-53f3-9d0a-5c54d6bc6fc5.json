Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips and decides to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips. If he can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row and he buys 30 yellow tulips, how many total rows of flowers will he plant?"

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThe total number of rows will be the sum of the rows of red, blue, and yellow tulips. To find the number of rows for each type of tulip, we can divide the total number of each tulip by the number of tulips that can fit in a single row.\n\nApproach:\n1. Calculate the number of rows of red, blue, and yellow tulips.\n2. Sum the number of rows.\n\nLet's code it. \n\n```python\n# number of tulips bought\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\nyellow_tulips = 30\n\n# tulips per row\nred_per_row = 6\nblue_per_row = 8\nyellow_per_row = 5\n\n# calculate rows\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_per_row\nyellow_rows = yellow_tulips // yellow_per_row\n\n# calculate total rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```\nOnce you print the total number of rows, you should get the solution. Use this Python code to directly solve the problem."

The number of total rows that Jackson will plant in his garden is 15.\n\nSo, the final solution is:\n\n\\boxed{15}. \n\nLet's go through the verification steps to ensure we've obtained the correct answer.\n\nVerification Steps:\n\n1. Check the calculations in the Python code:\n   - For the red tulips: 36 (total red tulips) divided by 6 (red tulips per row) equals 6 rows of red tulips.\n   - For the blue tulips: 24 (total blue tulips) divided by 8 (blue tulips per row) equals 3 rows of blue tulips.\n   - For the yellow tulips: 30 (total yellow tulips) divided by 5 (yellow tulips per row) equals 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n2. Sum up all the rows: 6 (red rows) + 3 (blue rows) + 6 (yellow rows) equals 15 rows in total.\n3. Match the final answer with the calculated total rows (15 = 15).\n\nSince all verification steps have produced correct results, we can confidently confirm the final answer."
