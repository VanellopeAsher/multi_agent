Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full three times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?"

Writing it three times: Elise wrote every letter 3 times, so she wrote a total of 3 * 26 letters.\n2. Writing half of it: She also wrote half the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 letters.\n3. Re-writing everything she has already written: This means that the sum of steps 1 and 2 is duplicated.\n\nNow we just need to write the equations based on these computations and determine the total number of letters."

      "content": "The code confirmed the total number of letters Elise wrote as 182. \n\nLet's move on to step 2 of the verification process. \n\nVerification:\n1. Elise writes the alphabet in full (26 letters) three times, for a total of 3 * 26 = 78 letters.\n2. She then writes half of it once, which adds another 26 / 2 = 13 letters.\n3. This adds up to a total of 78 + 13 = 91 letters.\n4. Elise then re-writes everything she has already written (i.e., 91 letters), so we add another 91 letters.\n5. This gives us a final total of 91 + 91 = 182 letters.\n\nGiven that our verification steps match the result, we can conclude that our answer is correct. \n\nTherefore, Elise has written a total of \\boxed{182} letters."
