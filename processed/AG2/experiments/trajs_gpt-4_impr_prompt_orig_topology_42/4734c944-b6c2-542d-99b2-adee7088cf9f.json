      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2.5 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?"

      "content": "This problem requires using basic arithmetic and several steps to solve. \n\nFirst, we'll figure out how much Peter spends each day, by dividing his total budget ($70) by the number of days in a week (7). \n\nNext, we'll calculate how many wooden action figures Peter can buy from Sunday through Wednesday, by dividing the total amount he spent during these four days by the price of each wooden figure ($5). \n\nThen, we'll determine how many plastic action figures he can purchase from Thursday through Saturday, by dividing the total expenditure during these three days by the cost of each plastic figure ($2.5). \n\nFinally, we'll add both figures together to find out the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. \n\nLet's write Python code to get those calculations done. \n\n```python\ntotal_budget = 70\ndays_in_week = 7\nwooden_figure_price = 5\nplastic_figure_price = 2.5\n\n# Calculate daily spending\ndaily_spending = total_budget / days_in_week\n\n# Calculating the number of days for wooden and plastic figures\nwooden_days = 4\nplastic_days = 3\n\n# Calculate the total number of each action figure he will have\ntotal_wooden_figures = (daily_spending * wooden_days) // wooden_figure_price\ntotal_plastic_figures = (daily_spending * plastic_days) // plastic_figure_price\n\n# Get the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\nprint(total_action_figures)\n```\n\nWe utilize floor division (//) instead of standard division (/) because Peter can't buy a fraction of an action figure. Floor division rounds down to the nearest whole number, accurately reflecting the number of action figures Peter can purchase.\n"
