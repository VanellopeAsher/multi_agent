Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now."

      "content": "Let's denote Darrell's age as D and Allen's age as A. Given that their ratio is 7:11, we have:\n\n```python\nD/A = 7/11\n```\n\nIn addition, it's known that their total age is 162. Then we have:\n\n```python\nD + A = 162\n```\n\nWe find from the first equation that D = 7/11 * A. Substituting D into the second equation allows us to find the value of A. Once we find it, we know that Allen's age 10 years from now will be A + 10.\n\nSteps to Solve:\n1. Rewrite the equation D = 7/11 * A using the sympy library in Python.\n2. Insert D's expression into the second equation, then calculate A's value.\n3. Add 10 to A's value to get Allen's age 10 years from now.\n\nApproach: Direct Python Solution.\nLet's proceed to implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nA = symbols('A')\n\nD = 7/11 * A\n\nEq1 = Eq(D + A, 162)\n\nA_val = solve(Eq1, A)[0]\nAllen_age_10_years_later = A_val + 10\n\nprint(Allen_age_10_years_later)\n```"
