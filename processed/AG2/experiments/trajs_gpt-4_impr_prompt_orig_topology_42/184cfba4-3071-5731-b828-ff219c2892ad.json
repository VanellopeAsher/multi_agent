Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

With the understanding that large stuffed animals sell for three times the price of small ones ($40), the following systems of equations can be formulated from the problem's information:\n\n1. L = S/2\n2. 40S + 120L = $1200\n\nNow, let's solve this system.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Import the required library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 2: Define the variables\nS, L = symbols('S L')\n\n# Step 3: Create the equations\nequation1 = Eq(L, S/2)\nequation2 = Eq(40*S + 120*L, 1200)\n\n# Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (S, L))\n\nprint(solution)\n```"

      "content": "VERIFICATION\n1. Let's first consider the number of large stuffed animals, L. Teresa sold 6 of these. Each large stuffed animal costs $120 (3 times the cost of a small stuffed animal, which is $40). As such, Teresa earned 6 * $120 = $720 from selling large stuffed animals.\n2. Then let's look at the small stuffed animals, S. Teresa sold 12 of these. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. From selling small stuffed animals, Teresa earned 12 * $40 = $480.\n3. Add up the money earned from both types of stuffed animals: $720 + $480 = $1200. As stated in the problem, Teresa earned $1200, which we've just verified.\n\nFINAL ANSWER\nTeresa sold \\boxed{12} small stuffed animals."
