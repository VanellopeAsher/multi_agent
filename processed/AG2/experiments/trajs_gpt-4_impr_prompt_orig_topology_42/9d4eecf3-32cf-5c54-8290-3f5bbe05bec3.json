Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries. If Robert has 3000 cherries, and has 1000 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?"

After knowing this, it's possible to figure out how many cherries Jerry has, because the total number of cherries is 6000. Finally, we can calculate how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's cherries from Robert's.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1. Calculate the number of cherries Richard has.\n2. Deduce the number of cherries Jerry has.\n3. Determine how many more cherries Robert has compared to Jerry.\n\nLet's do this step by step with Python:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of cherries Richard has.\n```python\nrobert_cherries = 3000\nrichard_cherries = robert_cherries - 1000\nprint(richard_cherries)\n```\n\nStep 2: Deduce the number of cherries Jerry has.\n```python\ntotal_cherries = 6000\njerry_cherries = total_cherries - robert_cherries - richard_cherries\nprint(jerry_cherries)\n```\n\nStep 3: Determine how many more cherries Robert has compared to Jerry.\n```python\nmore_cherries = robert_cherries - jerry_cherries\nprint(more_cherries)\n```"

With these results, we know that Richard has 2000 cherries, Jerry has 1000 cherries, and Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry.\n\nLet's take these results and verify them systematically:\n\nVERIFICATION\n\n1. Richard has 2000 cherries which is 1000 less than Robert - this aligns with the problem statement.\n2. Jerry has 1000 cherries which makes the total count (Richard's 2000 + Jerry's 1000 + Robert's 3000) to 6000, which is also correct based on the problem statement.\n3. Finally, Robert has 3000 cherries - 1000 cherries (Jerry's) resulting in 2000 more cherries, which is what we calculated.\n\nThese verifications affirm that our solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is that Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry.
