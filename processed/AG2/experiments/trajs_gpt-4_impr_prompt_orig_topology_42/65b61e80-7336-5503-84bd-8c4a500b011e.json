Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs.

This means that the friends of the Smith twins found all remaining eggs, except for 10. Let's redo the problem with this understanding:\n\nLet's redefine the given information:\n- The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 2*30 = 60 eggs.\n- All the other eggs except for 10 were found by the friends.\n\nSo, we subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 unfound eggs from the total to find out how many eggs the friends found.\n\nHowever, we are still missing the total number of eggs that were hidden by the Easter Egg Hunt team. Thus, we still need this missing information to be able to solve the problem."

      "content": "My apologies for the misinterpretation again. Let's re-examine the question:\n\n\"Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends\"\n\nThis means friends found all other eggs remaining after Smith twins except 10. Therefore, we don't actually need to know the total number of eggs. It's not necessary for solving this question. \nSo, let's calculate:\n\n1. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so our total eggs found by Smith twins = 2 * 30 = 60 eggs\n\nSince 10 are still left unfound, the friends found all of the remaining eggs. The count of the remaining eggs is the number we want to find.\n\nWe can follow these steps in Python:\n\n```python\n\n# Number of eggs found by the twins\neggs_twins = 2 * 30\n\n# Number of eggs left unfound\neggs_unfound = 10\n\n# Number of eggs found by the friends\neggs_friends = eggs_twins - eggs_unfound\n\n# printing the number of eggs found by friends\nprint(eggs_friends)\n```\nNote: This code assumes that the number of eggs is not negative (meaning the friends did not find fewer eggs than the number of unfound eggs). If the number of unfound eggs is greater than the number of eggs found by the twins, the output will be negative, which is not correct in the context of this problem. \n\nThis code should give us the right answer."
