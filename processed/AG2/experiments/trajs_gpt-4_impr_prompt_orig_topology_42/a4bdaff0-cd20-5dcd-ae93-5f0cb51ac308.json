Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $3000/month, her credit card's minimum is $2000/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $5000/month.

      "content": "# using python to calculate the total payment\n\nThe steps to solve this problem are as follows:\n1. First, we need to calculate the monthly minimum payment for each loan. The total minimum monthly payment is the sum of all the individual monthly payments.\n2. Next, we calculate how much Jessica wants to pay each month, i.e., 50% more than the minimum. \n3. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the above result by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year). \n\nLet's code these steps using python:\n\n```python\n# step 1: calculate the total minimum monthly payment\nstudent_loan_monthly_payment = 3000\ncredit_card_monthly_payment = 2000\nmortgage_monthly_payment = 5000\ntotal_min_monthly_payment = student_loan_monthly_payment + credit_card_monthly_payment + mortgage_monthly_payment\n\n# step 2: calculate the increased monthly payment\nincrease_ratio = 0.50\nincreased_monthly_payment = total_min_monthly_payment * (1 + increase_ratio)\n\n# step 3: calculate the annual payment\nnumber_of_months_per_year = 12\nannual_payment = increased_monthly_payment * number_of_months_per_year\n\nprint(annual_payment)\n```\n\nPlease execute this piece of code and let me know the result."

      "content": "From the numerical calculation, we find that if Jessica decides to make payments that are 50% more than the minimum, she would pay $180,000 in a year.\n\n# VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify the solution:\n\n1. We need to add all the minimum monthly payments for each loan:\n\n   For the student loan, minimum payment is $3000/month.\n   \n   For the credit card, minimum payment is $2000/month.\n   \n   For the mortgage, minimum payment is $5000/month.\n   \n   Adding these up, the total minimum monthly payment is $10000.\n\n2. Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. This means an additional 50/100 * $10000 = $5000 on top of the minimum. So, her total monthly payment would be $15000.\n\n3. Since there are 12 months in a year, Jessica's annual payment would be $15000/month * 12 months/year = $180000/year.\n\nSo, the answer is correct. Jessica pays $180,000 in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the monthly minimum.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{180000}."
