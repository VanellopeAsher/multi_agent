Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

We can solve it in the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the total number of unicorns in Scotland based on the number of female Scottish unicorns. Given that two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female and there are 6 female unicorns, the total number of unicorns in Scotland is three-thirds or simply 1 (whole).\n\nStep 2: Identify the total number of unicorns in the world based on the number of Scottish unicorns. Given that a third of the world's unicorns are in Scotland and there are 9 unicorns in Scotland, the total number of unicorns in the world is three times this amount.\n\nLet's solve this step by step."

The total number of unicorns in the world is 27.\n\nVerification:\nBased on the information provided:\n- Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female.\n- We know that there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland. \n- From this, we calculated that there are 9 unicorns in Scotland.\n- And since a third of all unicorns are in Scotland, this implies there should be 27 unicorns in the world.\n\nLet's plug the numbers back into the original questions to verify our answer:\n- Are there 9 unicorns in Scotland? Yes, because \\(6 * 1.5 = 9\\).\n- Does a third of the total number of unicorns (27) equal the number of unicorns in Scotland (9)? Yes, because \\(27 / 3 = 9\\).\n\nSo the final answer is correct and can be stated as:\n\nThe total number of unicorns in the world is \\boxed{27}."
