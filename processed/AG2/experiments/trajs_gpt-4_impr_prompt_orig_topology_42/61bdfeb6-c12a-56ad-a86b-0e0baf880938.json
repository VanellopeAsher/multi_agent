Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSamwell owns an appliance store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, one-fifth are projection TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?"

      "content": "This problem involves computing the difference between the total sold TVs and the sum of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs sold. The remaining number will correspond to the OLED TVs sold.\n\nThe detailed steps are:\n\n1. Compute the number of smart TVs sold which equals one-fourth of the total number of TVs sold.\n2. Compute the number of analog TVs sold which equals one-eighth of the total number of TVs sold.\n3. Compute the number of projection TVs sold which equals one-fifth of the total number of TVs sold.\n4. Sum the numbers obtained in steps 1, 2, and 3.\n5. Subtract the sum obtained in step 4 from the total number of TVs sold. The result is the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nLet's calculate using Python: \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the total number of TVs sold\ntotal_tvs = 40\n\n# Calculate the number of smart TVs sold\nsmart_tvs = total_tvs / 4\n\n# Calculate the number of analog TVs sold\nanalog_tvs = total_tvs / 8\n\n# Calculate the number of projection TVs sold\nprojection_tvs = total_tvs / 5\n\n# Calculate the sum of smart, analog and projection TVs sold\nsum_tvs = smart_tvs + analog_tvs + projection_tvs\n\n# Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold\noled_tvs = total_tvs - sum_tvs\n\noled_tvs\n```"

      "content": "Great! Now that we've obtained the computed result, we need to verify the solution.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Check the computed number of TVs for each type:\n\n   - Smart TVs: one-fourth of 40 is 10\n   - Analog TVs: one-eighth of 40 is 5\n   - Projection TVs: one-fifth of 40 is 8\n   - Sum of smart, analog and projection TVs available for sale = 10 + 5 + 8 = 23\n\n2. Subtract the calculated sum from the total number of TVs sold. \n\n   - OLED TVs = Total TVs - Sum of TVs = 40 - 23 = 17\n\nHence, the calculated OLED TVs sold matches the computed result, which assures the solution's accuracy.\n\nSo, Samwell was able to sell 17 OLED TVs. The final answer is boxed{17}."
