Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 60 feet, and the second tree has a height of 50 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?"

Let's identify the steps to solve this:\n\n- Calculate the height of the second tree by adding 50 feet to the height of the shortest tree.\n- Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second tree.\n- Multiply the combined height by 2 to find the height of the tallest tree.\n\nPython code to use this approach to solve the problem:\n```python\nshortest_tree = 60\nsecond_tree = shortest_tree + 50\ntallest_tree = (shortest_tree + second_tree) * 2\nprint(tallest_tree)\n```\n\nThis code block should yield the height of the tallest tree."

      "content": "VERIFICATION:\n\nTo verify this solution, we retrace the calculations made:\n\n- The height of the shortest tree is given as 60 feet. \n- We are told the second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest, therefore 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet.\n- Calculating the combined height of the shortest and second tree gives us 60 feet + 110 feet = 170 feet.\n- We are told the tallest tree is twice as tall as the combined height of the shortest and second tree, therefore 170 feet * 2 = 340 feet.\n\nTherefore, the tallest tree is indeed 340 feet tall. This matches the solution calculated by the Python program as well as the problem's conditions.\n\nThe final answer is that the height of the tallest tree is \\boxed{340} feet."
