Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. Each final is cut into 5 cm. How long is the ribbon?"

      "content": "In this problem, Marty is first splitting his ribbon into 4 equal parts and then splitting each of these further into 5 equal parts. This means the original length of the ribbon is divided into a total of 4*5=20 equal parts. We're told that each of these final cut parts is 5 cm long, so the original length of the ribbon is the product of the total number of equal parts and the length of each final part. \n\nLet's calculate this value using python. \n\n```python\n# Initialize the variables\n# number of initial divisions\ndiv1 = 4\n# divisions per initial division\ndiv2 = 5\n# length of final part\nfinal_len = 5\n\n# Calculate original length\noriginal_len = div1 * div2 * final_len\nprint(original_len)\n```\nAfter running this code, we can get the total length of the ribbon."

Marty cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts.\n2. Each of those parts is cut into 5 equal parts. That gives us 4*5 = 20 pieces.\n3. Each piece is 5 cm long.\n\nSo, total length of ribbon = number of pieces * length of each piece\n                             = 20 * 5\n                             = 100 cm\n                             \nThe result we obtained before (100 cm) matches with this calculation, which verifies our solution.\n\nThe total length of the ribbon initially was \\boxed{100} cm."
