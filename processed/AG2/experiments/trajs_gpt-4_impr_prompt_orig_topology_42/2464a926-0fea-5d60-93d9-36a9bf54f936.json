Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJolene and her friends are celebrating the start of summer with a water balloon battle. They prepare 10 sets of balloons, each set containing 30 balloons. By the time the afternoon ends, there are only 12 balloons remaining. How many balloons were used in their water balloon fight?"

Deducting the 12 balloons remaining at the end of the day, we can find out how many balloons were used in the water balloon fight.\n\nHere's how you streamline the calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\n# initialize the number of sets and balloons per set\nsets = 10\nballoons_per_set = 30\n\n# calculate the total number of balloons\ntotal_balloons = sets * balloons_per_set\n\n# initialize the number of remaining balloons\nremaining_balloons = 12\n\n# calculate the number of used balloons\nused_balloons = total_balloons - remaining_balloons\nused_balloons\n```"

Initially, they had 10 sets * 30 balloons/set = 300 balloons. At the end, there were 12 balloons left. This means that during the fight, they used 300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons, which is the same as our earlier calculated result. Hence, the calculation is verified and correct.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{288}."
