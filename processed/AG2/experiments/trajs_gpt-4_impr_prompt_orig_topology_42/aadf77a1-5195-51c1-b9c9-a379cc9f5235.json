Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. The quilt is 101 square feet. If a small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric, a medium one is 4 square feet, and a large one is 6 square feet, and she used 8 medium and 6 large shirts, how many small shirts did she use to make the quilt?"

Total area of small shirts is 33 square feet, obtained by subtracting the total areas of medium and large shirts from the total area of the quilt, 101 square feet.\n4. The number of small shirts used is 11, since each small shirt takes up 3 square feet and the area of the small shirts is 33 square feet (i.e., ```33/3``` equals 11).\n\nWe can summarize this as: to construct the 101 square feet quilt, 8 medium shirts (32 square feet), 6 large shirts (36 square feet), and 11 small shirts (33 square feet) were used.\n\nHence, the solution is that she used 11 small shirts.
