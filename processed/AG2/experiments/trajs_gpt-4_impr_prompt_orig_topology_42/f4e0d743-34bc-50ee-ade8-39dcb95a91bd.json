Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Additionally, Madeline also buys a special shampoo for her dog that costs $15 per month and a toy that costs $10 every two months. If there are 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year, how much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year?"

      "content": "This problem involves multiple sub-calculations. Let's solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the monthly expenditure on each category:\n\n- Food is bought every week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So the monthly cost of food will be 4 times the weekly cost.\n- Treats are bought every month. So the monthly cost of treats is the given cost.\n- Medicine is also bought every month, so the monthly cost of medicine is the given cost.\n- Shampoo is bought every month. So the monthly cost of shampoo is the given cost.\n- The toy is bought every two months, this means in a month, the cost of the toy is half of the given cost.\n\nNext, calculate the total monthly expenditure by adding the monthly costs of all items together.\n\nFinally, calculate the yearly expenditure by multiplying the monthly total by the number of months in a year.\n\nLet's codify this approach."

There are 12 months in a year, so the yearly total is $100 * 12 = $1200.\n2. Treat cost: $20 per month for 12 months = $240 per year.\n3. Medicine: $100 per month for 12 months = $1200 per year.\n4. Shampoo: $15 per month for 12 months = $180 per year.\n5. Toy: $10 every two months = $5 per month for 12 months = $60 per year.\n\nVerification by adding all the individual yearly costs:\n\n$1200 (food) + $240 (treats) + $1200 (medicine) + $180 (shampoo) + $60 (toys) = $2880, which matches the result obtained by the code.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n\nMadeline spends \\$boxed{2880} on her dog per year."
