Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?"

Calculate the total number of basketball cards by multiplying the number of decks by the number of cards in each deck.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of cards in each box.\n3. Sum up the total basketball cards, the total baseball cards, and the special collection of soccer cards to get the total number of cards Miss Maria has.\n4. Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria kept from the total number of cards to get the number of cards given to the students.\n5. Finally, calculate the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student got.  \n\nLet's solve it with Python. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of decks and cards in each deck\nnum_decks, cards_in_each_deck = 6, 25\n\n# number of boxes and cards in each box\nnum_boxes, cards_in_each_box = 5, 40\n\n# special collection of soccer cards \nsoccer_cards = 30\n\n# number of cards Miss Maria kept\nkept_cards = 50\n\n# number of cards each student got\ncards_each_student = 10\n\n# calculate the total number of basketball cards\ntotal_basketball_cards = num_decks * cards_in_each_deck\n\n# calculate the total number of baseball cards\ntotal_baseball_cards = num_boxes * cards_in_each_box\n\n# sum up the total cards\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards + soccer_cards\n\n# calculate the number of cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - kept_cards\n\n# calculate the number of students\nnum_students = cards_given_to_students / cards_each_student\n\nprint(num_students)\n```\n\nNow you need to run this code in a Python environment to get the result."
