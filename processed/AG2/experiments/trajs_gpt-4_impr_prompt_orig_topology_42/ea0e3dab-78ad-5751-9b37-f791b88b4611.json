Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month. If the streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged her 15% less money on the other half of the year, calculate the total amount she had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year."

Calculate the amount paid for the first half of the year (i.e. for 6 months) by multiplying the monthly charge by the number of months.\n2. Compute the reduced amount for the second half of the year by deducting 15% from the original monthly charge and multiply it by the number of months.\n3. Add the amounts paid for both halves to get the total amount paid for the year.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# initial monthly charge\nmonthly_charge = 200\n\n# number of months in half a year\nmonths = 6\n\n# total amount for first half\nfirst_half_amount = monthly_charge * months\n\n# amount for second half with 15% reduction\nsecond_half_amount = (monthly_charge * (1 - 0.15)) * months\n\n# total amount for the year\ntotal_amount = first_half_amount + second_half_amount\n\nprint(total_amount)\n```"

For the next 6 months, she was charged 15% less, or 85% of the original amount, which is $200 * 0.85 = $170 per month. Over 6 months, this totals $170 * 6 = $1020.\n3. Adding these together, the total amount she paid for the full year is $1200 + $1020 = $2220.\n\nAfter verifying these computations, it can be concluded that by the end of the year Aleena had paid a total of \\$2220 for the streaming service.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2220}."
