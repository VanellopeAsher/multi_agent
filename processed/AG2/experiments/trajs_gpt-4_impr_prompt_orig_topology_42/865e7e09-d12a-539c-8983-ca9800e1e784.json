Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo girls each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water. Then a boy got 8 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved directly using Python. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Check how much water each girl got - since they each got 1/4 of the 32 liters.\n2. Subtract the obtained value (for both girls) from the original amount.\n3. Subtract the 8 liters that the boy received from the remaining amount.\n\nLet's put this plan into action:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# the total amount of water\ntotal_water = 32\n\n# how much water each girl got\nwater_per_girl = total_water / 4\n\n# total water got by girls\ntotal_water_girls = 2 * water_per_girl\n\n# remaining water after girls got their share\nremaining_water_after_girls = total_water - total_water_girls\n\n# remaining water after boy got his share\nremaining_water = remaining_water_after_girls - 8\n\nremaining_water\n```\n\nThe answer to the problem would be the calculated remaining water."
