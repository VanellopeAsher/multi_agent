Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is wrapping Christmas gifts. She has 6 gifts to wrap for her family, 4 gifts to wrap for her friends and 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers. She wants to make a bow for each gift. How many inches of ribbon can she use for each gift bow?"

      "content": "Apologies for the confusion earlier, but I need to clarify that the total length of the ribbon Monica has is essential for this problem. Without this information, we are unable to determine how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow. \n\nAs the given problem is, currently, it is indeed Case 3. We need to identify the total length of the ribbon before we can share how this ribbon can be distributed. Once we have the length of the ribbon, we can divide this total by the number of gifts Monica wants to wrap. \n\nWe have:\n- 6 gifts for her family,\n- 4 gifts for her friends, and\n- 2 gifts for her teachers. \n\nThis is a total of 12 gifts. \n\nHence, the calculation we need to perform once we have the total ribbon length, `total_ribbon`, is `total_ribbon / 12`. \n\nWithout the total ribbon length, we can't proceed any further with this problem. Therefore, as per the given guidelines, the result is:\n   \n\\boxed{'None'}"
