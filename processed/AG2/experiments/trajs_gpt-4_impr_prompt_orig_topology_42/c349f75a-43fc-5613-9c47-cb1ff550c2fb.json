Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

The solution will follow direct python way. Let's identify quantities from the problem:\n\n1. There are 10 sisters, each aged 16.\n2. There are 2 brothers; one is aged 12, and the other is twice this age.\n\nUsing these quantities, we can calculate:\n\n```python\n# Calculating the total age of sisters\ntotal_age_sisters = 10 * 16\n\n# Calculating the total age of brothers\ntotal_age_brothers = 12 + (12 * 2)\n\n# Adding the total age of sisters and brothers to get the total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_age_sisters + total_age_brothers\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nThe output of the print function will give us the total age of all the siblings. Let's go ahead and solve it."

The calculation for the total age of brothers: 12 + (12 * 2)  = 12 + 24 = 36.\n4. Adding the total age of sisters and brothers to get the total age of all siblings: 160 + 36 = 196.\n5.
