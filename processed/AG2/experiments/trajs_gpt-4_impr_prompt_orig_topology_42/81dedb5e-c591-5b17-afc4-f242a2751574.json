Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

If the total length of the ribbon is represented by the variable `ribbon_length`, using division to find the length of each section will yield the desired result. \n\nCode:\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbol representing the length of the ribbon\nribbon_length = sp.symbols('ribbon_length')\n\n# First, the ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts\npart_1 = ribbon_length / 4\n\n# Then each of those parts is cut into 5 equal parts\nfinal_part = part_1 / 5\n```\n\nIn order to utilize this code to solve the given problem, however, the actual length of the ribbon must be known.

The given output shows that to get the length of each final part, you have to divide the total ribbon length by 20. \nIf, for example, `ribbon_length` was 100 units, `final_part` would be `100 / 20 = 5` units.\nTo compute this using Python, we can substitute a value into `ribbon_length` like this:\n\n```python\nribbon_length_val = 100  # Assume the ribbon length is 100 units\nfinal_part_val = ribbon_length_val / 20\nprint(final_part_val)\n```\n\nThis will provide the numerical length of each final cut with the given `ribbon_length` value."
