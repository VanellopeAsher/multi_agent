Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than it had on Monday. However, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. On Thursday, the tank's water depth increased by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday. What is the tank’s water depth on Thursday?"

Tuesday's water depth is 7 feet more than Monday; 17 + 7 equals 24 feet.\n3. Wednesday's water depth is two thirds of Tuesday's depth; 2/3 * 24 equals 16 feet.\n4. Thursday's depth increased by half of the difference between Tuesday's depth and Wednesday's depth; the difference between 24 feet and 16 feet is 8 feet, half of which is 4 feet. Therefore, adding this increase to Wednesday's depth, 16 + 4 equals 20 feet.\n\nAfter verifying the calculation, we're confident that the tank's water depth on Thursday is 20 feet.\n\nFinal Result:\n\nThe tank's water depth on Thursday is \boxed{20} feet."
