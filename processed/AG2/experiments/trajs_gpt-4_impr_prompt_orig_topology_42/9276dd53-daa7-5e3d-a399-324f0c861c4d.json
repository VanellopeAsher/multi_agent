Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 2000 helmets, calculate the total number of items Dominick saw."

The total number of items will be the sum of the numbers of robots, helmets, and footballs.\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n\n```python\n# number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# number of robots is half the number of helmets\nrobots = helmets / 2\n\n# number of helmets is half the number of footballs\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\n# total number of items\ntotal_items = helmets + robots + footballs\n\nprint(total_items)\n```\nPlease provide the result after running this python script."

      "content": "Great! The result indicates that Dominick saw a total of 7000 items in the changing room. \n\nVerification:\nLet's verify this result. According to the problem statement, there are twice as many footballs as helmets and half as many robots as helmets. Given that there are 2000 helmets, the number of robots would be 2000/2 = 1000 and the number of footballs would be 2000*2 = 4000. If we add these numbers together, we get 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000, which matches our result.\n\nTherefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 7000.\n\nSo the final answer to the problem is \\boxed{7000}."
