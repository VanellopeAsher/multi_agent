Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use the definition of profit which states that:\n\nProfit = Total Income - Total Cost\n\nGiven that the total income and profit are $92 and $20 respectively, we can express the Total Expenses as:\n\nTotal Expenses = Total Income - Profit\n\nWe also know that Total Expenses can be calculated as the sum of all the costs of bleach and cloth packs. With this information, we can create an equation and solve it. Each client has one cloth pack and 2 bottles of bleach. So for 8 clients, Kim will need 16 bottles of bleach and 8 cloth packs.\n\nThus, the cost of bleach is 16 * cost of one bottle of bleach and the cost of all cloth packs is 8 * cost of one cloth pack.\n\nWe can formulate the equation as follows:\n\nTotal Expenses = (16 * 2) + (8 * cost of one cloth pack)\n\nThe cost of one cloth pack can then be calculated by rearranging this equation and solving for its value: \n\ncost of one cloth pack = (Total Expenses - (16 * 2)) / 8 \n\nGiven the total income ($92) and profit ($20), let's plug in the numbers and compute this calculation."
