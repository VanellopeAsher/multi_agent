Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

Use this total to determine the total time spent vacationing (since the activities account for 30% of the vacation).\n3. Calculate the time spent sightseeing using the total vacation time (since sightseeing accounted for 40% of the total time).\n\nLet's begin by calculating the total time spent on activities.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# time spent boating\nboating_hours = 6\n\n# time spent swimming\nswimming_hours = boating_hours / 2\n\n# time spent watching shows\nno_of_shows = 3\ntime_per_show = 2  # hours\nshows_hours = no_of_shows * time_per_show\n\n# total time spent on activities\ntotal_activity_hours = boating_hours + swimming_hours + shows_hours\ntotal_activity_hours\n```\n\nNext, I will use this total to calculate the total vacation time."

From this, we can figure out the total time spent vacationing.\n\n```python\n# total activity time is 30% of total vacation time\n# so total vacation time is total activity time divided by 30% (or 0.3)\ntotal_vacation_hours = total_activity_hours / 0.3\ntotal_vacation_hours\n```\n\nFinally, I will use this total vacation time to calculate the time spent sightseeing.
