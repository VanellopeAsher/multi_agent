Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30.

      "content": "Great! You received T_value as 20, which means Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.\n\nLet's complete our verification steps:\n\n1. It's stated in the problem that a packet of tomato seeds costs $40. Thus, 20 packets would cost $40 * 20 = $800.\n2. It's also mentioned that 80 packets of celery seeds cost $30 per packet, which leads to a total cost of $30 * 80 = $2400.\n3. The total amount of money available for seed purchases was $3200. If we add up the cost of the tomato seeds ($800) and the cost of the celery seeds ($2400), our resulting total cost is indeed $3200. \n\nSo, I can confirm that our solution is correct.\n\nThe answer to the problem is \\boxed{20}. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds."
