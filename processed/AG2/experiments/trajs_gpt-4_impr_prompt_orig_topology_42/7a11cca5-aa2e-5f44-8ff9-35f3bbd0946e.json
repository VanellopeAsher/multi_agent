Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases on the third day so that the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons, calculate the increase amount in the third day."

After the first day, this volume doubles, i.e., it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.\n\nOn the third day, the total volume passing through the river is given as 14000 gallons. \n\nThe required solution is the increase in the volume on the third day.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem would be to subtract the volume of water on the second day from the volume of water on the third day.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the volume of water on the first and second days\nvolume_first_day = 4000  \nvolume_second_day = 2 * volume_first_day\n\n# Initialize the total volume on the third day\ntotal_volume_third_day = 14000  \n\n# Calculate the increase in volume on the third day\nincrease_third_day = total_volume_third_day - volume_second_day\n\nincrease_third_day\n```\n\nThis Python script will return the increase in the volume measure on the third day."
