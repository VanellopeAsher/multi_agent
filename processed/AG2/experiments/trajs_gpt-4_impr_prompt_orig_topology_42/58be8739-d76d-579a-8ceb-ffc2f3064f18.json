Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

First, we'll calculate how much time John spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows.\n\n```python\nboating_hours = 6\nswimming_hours = boating_hours / 2\nshows_hours = 3 * 2  # 3 shows each of 2 hours\n\ntotal_activity_hours = boating_hours + swimming_hours + shows_hours\n```\n\n2. Now, we know that these activities accounted for 30% of his total vacation time. So, we can compute the total vacation time measure:\n\n```python\ntotal_vacation_hours = (total_activity_hours * 100) / 30  # since 30% = total_activity_time\n```\n\n3. Lastly, to determine how long he spent sightseeing, we subtract the time he spent on boating, swimming, and shows from the total time:\n\n```python\nsightseeing_hours = total_vacation_hours - total_activity_hours\n```\n\nNow let's input these equations into a Python script to calculate the answer."

Therefore, he spent the remaining time, which is 35 hours, on sightseeing. \n\nLet me do a quick verification to ensure the computations are correct. \n\nIn the verification process:\n1. I will check whether the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows equals 15 hours.\n2. I will ensure that the total vacation time (50 hours) is indeed 100% with respect to this 30% (15 hours).\n3. I will also verify whether the difference between the total vacation time and the time spent on boating, swimming, and shows gives the time spent on sightseeing (35 hours).\n\nSince the total activity time is 15 hours and the total vacation hours is 50 hours, this means that the total activity time is indeed 30% of the total time. It gives us 50 when multiplied by 100 and divided by 30. Therefore, the total vacation is correct.\n\nAlso, the difference in hours between the total vacation time and the total activity time is indeed 35 hours, which is the time spent sightseeing.\n\nSo, the computations seem to be correct. Thus, John spent \\boxed{35} hours sightseeing."
