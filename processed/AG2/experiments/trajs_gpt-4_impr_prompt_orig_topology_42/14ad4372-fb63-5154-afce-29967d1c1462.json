Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday. On Sundays, she takes a break and doesn't teach any classes. Each class has 15 students. She charges $15.00 per student for each class. Additionally, she offers a free 5-minute warm-up session before each class, which doesn't affect her earnings. How much money does she make in 1 week?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved step by step by calculating the daily income and then aggregating it for the entire week.\n\nThe key ideas are:\n1. Compute the total number of classes Judy teaches each day.\n2. Multiply this number by the number of students in each class and the charge per student to yield the total income for that day.\n3. Use this process to calculate the income for each day of the week.\n4. Add up the income for each day to find the total weekly income.\n\nLet's begin by computing the income for each day.\n\n```python\nstudent_count = 15\ncharge_per_student_per_class = 15.00\n\nclasses_per_day_weekday = 5\nclasses_per_day_saturday = 8\nclasses_per_day_sunday = 0 \n\nincome_per_day_weekday = classes_per_day_weekday * student_count * charge_per_student_per_class\nincome_per_day_saturday = classes_per_day_saturday * student_count * charge_per_student_per_class\nincome_per_day_sunday = classes_per_day_sunday * student_count * charge_per_student_per_class\n\nprint(income_per_day_weekday)\nprint(income_per_day_saturday)\nprint(income_per_day_sunday)\n```"

      "content": "The weekly income for Judy from teaching dance classes is \\$7425.00. \n\nVerification:\n1. The daily income on a weekday (Monday to Friday) is 5 classes * 15 students * $15.00, which equals $1125.00.\n2. The total income from weekdays is $1125.00/day * 5 days, which equals $5625.00.\n3. The daily income on Saturday is 8 classes * 15 students * $15.00, which equals $1800.00.\n4. Judy does not teach any class on Sunday, so the income for Sunday is $0.00.\n5. Adding all these together: $5625.00 (weekdays income) + $1800.00 (Saturday income) + $0.00 (Sunday income) gives $7425.00, which matches our computed result.\n\nHence, Judy makes \\boxed{7425} dollars in one week."
