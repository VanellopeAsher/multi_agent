Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAn electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each and gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. If the seller also bought a tablet for $330 and a pair of headphones for $137, how much will the seller give back in change after deducting the cost of the phones, the tablet, and the headphones?"

Compute the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount of $4000 given by the customer.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\n# number of phones\nn_phones = 5\n\n# cost per phone\ncost_phone = 700\n\n# cost of tablet\ncost_tablet = 330\n\n# cost of headphones\ncost_headphones = 137\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = n_phones*cost_phone + cost_tablet + cost_headphones\n\n# amount paid by the customer\namount_paid = 4000\n\n# calculate change\nchange = amount_paid - total_cost\n\nprint(change)\n```\n\nThis Python code will calculate and print the change which the customer should receive."

The total cost of the phones is $700 per phone times 5 phones, which equals $3500. \n2. The cost of the tablet is $330.\n3. The cost of the headphones is $137. \n\nAdding these all together, the total cost of all items is $3500 + $330 + $137 = $3967.\n\nThe amount paid by the customer is $4000.\n\nSubtracting the total cost from the amount given by the customer, the change due should be $4000 - $3967 = $33. \n\nOur calculations are accurate, therefore, the conclusion from the code execution we see above that the seller should give back $33 in change is correct.\n\nThis confidently leads us to the final result. The change that the customer should receive is available in the box below.\n\n\\boxed{33}."
