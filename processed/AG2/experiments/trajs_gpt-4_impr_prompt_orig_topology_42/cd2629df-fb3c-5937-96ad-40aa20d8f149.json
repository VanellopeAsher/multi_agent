Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To make things more interesting, he decided to pay her back in a unique way. For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month.

      "content": "The amount that Stephen will pay his sister on the twelfth month, excluding his expenditure on coins, is $\\boxed{31} dollars. \n\nThis amount has been calculated by determining the total debt (including the 2% interest), subtracting the sum that Stephen had already paid over the previous 11 months ($25 per month), and disregarding Stephen's personal expenses related to his coin collecting activity. \n\nGreat job! \n\nLet's review our solution!\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nWe first considered that Stephen borrowed $300 and pledged to further include 2% interest upon repayment. This led to a total debt of $306.\n\nFor the first 11 months, Stephen had been consistently paying $25 per month, which amounts to $275.\n\nBy the 12th month, Stephen therefore had a remaining debt of $31, exclusive of any personal expenses such as coin acquisitions. The Python code verified these calculations. \n\nOur solution is thus verified as correct."
