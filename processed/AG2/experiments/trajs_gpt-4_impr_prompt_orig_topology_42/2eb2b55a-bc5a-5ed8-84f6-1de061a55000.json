Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack.

In the run, we found that the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day was 19.\n\nNow, we need to verify our answer.\n\nVerification:\n\nLet's calculate the total number of bandages available each day and the total consumption and further see if this meets the conditions mentioned in the problem: \n\n1. Initial day: they have 19 bandages, buy 50 more, use 38. This leaves them with 19 + 50 - 38 = 31 bandages at the end.\n2. Second day: they use 10 less than the previous day, 28 bandages. This leaves them with 31 - 28 = 3 bandages at the end.\n3. Third day: they buy 2 large packs, that's 100 more bandages and use half of one (25). This leaves them with 3 + 100 - 25 = 78 bandages at the end. \n\nThis is exactly what was stated in the problem, thus confirming that our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day is \\boxed{19}."
