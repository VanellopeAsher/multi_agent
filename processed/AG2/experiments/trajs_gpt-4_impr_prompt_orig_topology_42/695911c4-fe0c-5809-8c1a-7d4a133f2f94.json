Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $10. After 10 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

      "content": "Great! After calculating, we found that Pauline spent a total of $525 on all visits to the museum.\n\nNow, let's verify this result.\n\nVerification:\n1. For the first 10 years, Pauline pays $10 per visit and visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the total cost for the first 10 years is $10/visit * 3 visits/year * 10 years = $300.\n2. After 10 years, the cost of each visit has increased by 150%, so the new cost per visit is $10 + $10 * 150% = $25.\n3. For the next 3 years, Pauline pays $25 per visit and visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the total cost for the next 3 years is $25/visit * 3 visits/year * 3 years = $225.\n4. The total cost for the entire 13 years is $300 (first 10 years) + $225 (next 3 years) = $525.\n\nYes, the result is correct. The total cost that Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $525. \n\nHence, the final answer to the problem is \\boxed{525}."
