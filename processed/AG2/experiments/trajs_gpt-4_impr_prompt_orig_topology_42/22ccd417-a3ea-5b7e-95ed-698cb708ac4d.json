Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses. How many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi each time?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved using algebra. \n\nThe dosage can be described by the equation: one_medicine + three_times_one_medicine = total_dosage.\n\nHere, \none_medicine is the mL of one medicine combining each time,\nthree_times_one_medicine is 3 times the amount of the second medicine,\ntotal_dosage is the total mL of medicine in one dose.\n\nSince the total mL of medicine in 8 doses is 448, the total dosage of one dose is 448 / 8.\n\nTherefore, we have the algebraic equation: one_medicine + 3 * one_medicine = 448 / 8. \n\nBy solving this equation, we can find out the mL of one medicine combined by Saanvi each time. \n\nLet's compute this."

Let's calculate this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# This will automatically enable the best printer available in your environment.\ninit_printing()\n\none_medicine = symbols('one_medicine')\n\neq = Eq(4 * one_medicine, 448 / 8)\nsol = solve(eq, one_medicine)\nsol\n```\n\nThe above python code will solve for the variable 'one_medicine'.

This means Saanvi combines 14 mL of one medicine each time.\n\nLet's visualize the verification process to double-check the answer:\n\nVERIFICATION\n1. Saanvi's total dosage for one medicine and three times the second medicine per instance is 14 mL + 3 * 14 mL = 56 mL.\n2. There are 8 such doses in 448 mL, which checks out because 8 * 56 mL = 448 mL.\n\nAfter going through these steps, we can confirm that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{14}."
