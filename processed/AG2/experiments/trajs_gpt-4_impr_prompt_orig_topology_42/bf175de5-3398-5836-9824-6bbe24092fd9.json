Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "In this problem, we need to understand that the time taken to complete a task is inversely proportional to the number of individuals working on it. \n\nTo break it down, if using more individuals, the time to complete a task decreases. Therefore, if one individual takes 5 days to paint half of the house, the entire house will be painted in 10 days by one individual. \n\nHowever, if we have 5 individuals painting at the same pace, they will paint the entire house in 1/5th of the time. \n\nGiven that there are 24 hours in a day, we can write the final solution as:\n\\[\n\\text{{days}} = \\frac{{10}}{{5}} = 2 \\text{{ days}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{{hours}} = \\text{{days}} \\times \\text{{hours in a day}} = 2 \\times 24 = 48\\text{{ hours}}\n\\]\n\nLet's code it to double check.\n```python\n# one worker will paint a whole house in 10 days\n# therefore, 5 workers will do the same job in 1/5 of the time\ndays = 10 / 5\n\n# convert days to hours\nhours = days * 24\nprint(hours)\n```\n\nThe expected output should be 48 (hours)."

Given that one painter can paint half a house in 5 days, it is safe to conclude that they could paint an entire house in double the timeâ€”i.e., 10 days.\n2. Given that we have 5 painters working simultaneously and at the same pace, the time required to paint the house will be divided by 5, according to the formula of work done, resulting in a total of 2 days.\n3. The conversion from days to hours entails multiplying by 24 because there are 24 hours in a day. This results in a total of 48 hours.\n\nHence, based on our calculation and its verification, we can conclude that it will take 5 individuals 48 hours to paint a house, working at the same pace as the single individual.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{48}."
