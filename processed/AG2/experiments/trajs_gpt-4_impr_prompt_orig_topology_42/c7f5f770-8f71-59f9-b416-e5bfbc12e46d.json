Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGriffin had 30 french fries, but Kyle took 6 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. If in the end Griffin had 33 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?"

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which means he took 2 * 6 = 12 fries.\n4. Colby took 3 less than what Kyle had taken, which means he took 6 - 3 = 3 fries.\n5. The total number of fries Griffin lost is 6 (Kyle) + 12 (Billy) + 3 (Colby) = 21 fries.\n6. If we subtract the number of fries Griffin lost from his initial number of fries, we can find out how many fries Griffin had before Ginger gave him some. \n7. The number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is the final number of fries Griffin had minus the number he had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took theirs.\n\nCalculations using Python:\n1. Calculate the number of fries Griffin had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took theirs: 30 - 21.\n2. Calculate the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin: 33 (final number of fries Griffin had) - the number from the previous calculation (number of fries Griffin had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took theirs)."

Initial number of fries that Griffin had = 30\n2. Fries taken by Kyle = 6\n3. Fries taken by Billy = twice than Kyle = 2 * 6 = 12\n4. Fries taken by Colby = 3 less than Kyle = 6 - 3 = 3\n5. Total fries taken from Griffin = 6 + 12 + 3 = 21\n6. So, the fries Griffin had before Ginger gave him some = 30 - 21 = 9\n7. In the end, Griffin had 33 fries, so the fries that Ginger gave to Griffin = 33 - 9 = 24\n8. The result derived from the Python code (24) matches with the manually derived result (24), hence verified."
