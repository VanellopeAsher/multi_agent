Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this number represents one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer at home, how many students are there at that grade level?"

D is three-fourths of the total students\n2. 20 students who do not have Desktops are one-third of A.\n\nWe know that D + A = Total Students.\n\n1. From the first given specification, if D comprises three-fourths of the students, then A must comprise one-fourth of the total students. This is because there are no fractions of students who have a laptop, so this 'unseen' portion of students has to be made up of individuals from A, who don’t have either a Desktop or a Laptop.\n\n2. From the second given specification, we know that 20 students are one-third of A.  \n\nWe will solve these equations in our Python code."
