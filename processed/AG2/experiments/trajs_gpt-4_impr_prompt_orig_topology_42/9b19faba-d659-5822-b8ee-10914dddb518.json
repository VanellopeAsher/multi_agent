Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?"

      "content": "This problem can be addressed through a step-by-step process. \n\n1. Calculate the total number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold on each day.\n2. Multiply the total number of each box by their respective prices.\n3. Calculate the total amount earned by summing the earnings from the gingerbread and apple pie.\n\nLet's now solve these steps using Python.\n\nStep 1: Calculate total number of boxes sold on each day.\n```python\n# For Saturday\ngingerbread_saturday = 10\napple_pie_saturday = 15 - 4 # from the problem: (he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday)\n\n# For Sunday\ngingerbread_sunday = 10 + 5 # from the problem: (he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday)\napple_pie_sunday = 15 \n\n# For Monday\ngingerbread_monday = 2\napple_pie_monday = 4\n\n# Total gingerbread and apple pie boxes\ntotal_gingerbread = gingerbread_saturday + gingerbread_sunday + gingerbread_monday\ntotal_apple_pie = apple_pie_saturday + apple_pie_sunday + apple_pie_monday\n```\n\nStep 2: Compute total incomes for gingerbread and apple pie.\n```python\ngingerbread_price = 6    \napple_pie_price = 15\n\n# Total income for gingerbread and apple pie\ntotal_income_gingerbread = total_gingerbread * gingerbread_price\ntotal_income_apple_pie = total_apple_pie * apple_pie_price\n```\n\nStep 3: Calculate total earnings.\n```python\n# Total income\ntotal_income = total_income_gingerbread + total_income_apple_pie\n```\n\nWe get total_income which is the desired solution."

Calculate the total number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold over the three days.\n   - On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 11 boxes of apple pie (since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday).\n   - On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie (since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday).\n   - On Monday, he sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie.\n\nAdding these all up, Sunny sold a total of 27 boxes of gingerbread and 30 boxes of apple pie.\n\n2. Calculate the total income from the gingerbread and apple pie.\n   - The total income from gingerbread is 27 boxes * $6/box = $162.\n   - The total income from apple pie is 30 boxes * $15/box =  $450.\n\nAdd these two amounts together to get the total income. $162 + $450 = $612, which matches your results. Therefore, the total income Sunny earned over the three days is indeed $612. \n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{612}. \n"
