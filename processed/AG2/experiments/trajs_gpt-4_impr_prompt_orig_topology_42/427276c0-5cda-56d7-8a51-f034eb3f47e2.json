Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?"

      "content": "This is a simple average calculation problem. We will calculate the total height of the heels and divide it by the total number of women.\n\nHere is the step by step approach:\n\n1. Get the total height of the heels worn by the women with 4.5-inch heels.\n2. Get the total height of the heels worn by the women with 2.5-inch heels.\n3. Combine the total heights of the two groups to get the overall total height.\n4. Divide the overall total height by the total number of women to find the average.\n\nNow, let's write these steps in python:\n```python\n# total number of women\ntotal_women = 3 + 3\n\n# total height of heels with 4.5 inches\ntotal_height_4_5_inches = 4.5 * 3\n\n# total height of heels with 2.5 inches\ntotal_height_2_5_inches = 2.5 * 3\n\n# overall total height\noverall_total_height = total_height_4_5_inches + total_height_2_5_inches\n\n# average height\naverage_height = overall_total_height / total_women\n\n# print the result\nprint(average_height)\n```"

      "content": "Great! You've successfully calculated the average height of the heels worn by the women at the party. So, the average height of heels at this party is 3.5 inches.\n\nLet's go through the verification steps:\n\n- There were 3 women wearing 4.5-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2.5-inch heels.\n- The total heel height worn by the women with 4.5-inch heels is 4.5 * 3 = 13.5 inches.\n- The total heel height worn by the women with 2.5-inch heels is 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 inches.\n- Adding these two totals, we get 13.5 + 7.5 = 21 inches.\n- This amount is to be distributed among 6 women. Hence, 21 total inches / 6 women = 3.5 inches per woman, on average.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{3.5}."
