Calculate how many crayons are there in total by multiplying the number of crayon boxes by the number of crayons in each box (3 boxes * 64 crayons/box);\n2. Calculate how many muffin crayons can be produced by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayon pieces needed to make each muffin crayon (8 pieces/muffin);\n3. Determine the selling price of each muffin crayon by dividing the total amount gained from selling all muffin crayons by the total number of muffin crayons produced. "
