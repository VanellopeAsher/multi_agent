In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

To do this, multiply the original price by the increase percentage (80%).\n\nStep 2: Add the increase amount from Step 1 to the original price. This gives you the price of the toy in December.\n\nStep 3: Compute the decrease amount in January by multiplying the price of the toy in December (from Step 2) by the decrease percentage (50%).\n\nStep 4: To get the price of the toy after the discount in January, subtract the decrease amount (from Step 3) from the price of the toy in December (from Step 2).\n\nFinally, you'll have the price of the toy after the discount in January."
