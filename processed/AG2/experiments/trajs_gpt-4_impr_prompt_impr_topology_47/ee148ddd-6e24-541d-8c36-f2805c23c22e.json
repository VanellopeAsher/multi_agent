  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

To do this, add the time spent boating to half of this time (the time spent swimming): total time = boating time + half of boating time.\n2. Also, find out the total time spent watching shows. As each show was 2 hours long and he watched 3 shows, this total time will be 2 hours/show x 3 shows.\n3. Add the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows together to get the total time spent on these activities.\n4. From the problem, we know that the time spent on these activities was 30% of the total time spent. So, we can find the total time by dividing the time spent on these activities by 30% (0.30).\n5. John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. To find out how long this was, we can multiply the total time (as derived above) by 40% (0.40).\n6. The time spent sightseeing will be given in hours."

Thus, the total time spent boating and swimming = 6 + 3 = 9 hours.\n\nStep 2: Each show was 2 hours long, and he watched 3 shows. Therefore, the time spent watching shows = 2 * 3 = 6 hours.\n\nStep 3: The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows = 9 hours (from boating and swimming) + 6 hours (from watching shows) = 15 hours.\n\nStep 4: Given that the time spent on these activities was 30% of the total time, the total time = time spent on these activities / 30% = 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.\n\nStep 5: The time he spent sightseeing = 40% of the total time = 0.40 * 50 hours = 20 hours.\n\nSo, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
