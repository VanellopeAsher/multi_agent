In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

That is, $19 (for pots) plus $26 (for soil) equals $45.\n\n2. Then, to find the final cost, subtract the discount from the initial total cost. That is, $45 (initial total cost) minus $7 (the discount) equals $38.\n\nSo, the total amount of money my mother expended at the gardening store was $38."
