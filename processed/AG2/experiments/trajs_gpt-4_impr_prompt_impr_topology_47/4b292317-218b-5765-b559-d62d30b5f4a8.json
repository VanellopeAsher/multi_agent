To find the length of each part, divide the total length by the number of parts. \n\nStep 2: Each of the 40 parts must be then divided into 50 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, divide the length of the 40 parts by 50.\n\nLet's begin.\n\nStep 1: \nLength of one part after the first cut = Total length / Number of parts\n                                               = 10000 mm / 40\n                                               = 250 mm\n\nStep 2:\nFinal length of each cut = Length of each part after the first cut / Number of parts in the second cut\n                            = 250 mm / 50\n                            = 5 mm \n\nSo, each of the final cut will be 5 mm long."
