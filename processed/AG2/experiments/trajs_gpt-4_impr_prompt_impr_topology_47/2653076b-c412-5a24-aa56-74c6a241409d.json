Calculate the cost for each type of items he bought:  \n- Croissants: 5 * $3.50 each\n- Cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 each\n- Mini quiches: 3 * $4.50 each\n- Blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.50 each\n2. Add all the costs to obtain the subtotal.\n3. Apply the 10% discount to the subtotal. You can do this by multiplying the subtotal by 10% (or 0.1) and then subtracting that amount from the subtotal.\n4. The result from step 3 is Marcus' total bill."

They calculated the cost for each type of item, summed them up to create a subtotal, and then subtracted the 10% discount from the subtotal to find the final cost. The Python code executed by Agent Code Executor correctly implemented these steps and returned a result of 54.45.
