In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Since she made a profit of $160 and she earned $8 - $4 = $4 profit per bag, she sold $160 / $4 = 40 bags.\n\n2. Each pack contains 5 bags, so she must have bought 40 / 5 = 8 packs of canvas bags in total. \n\nSo, Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags."

Let's write the python code for this."
