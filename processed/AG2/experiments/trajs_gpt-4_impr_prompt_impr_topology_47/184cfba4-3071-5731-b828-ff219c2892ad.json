      "content": "Let's denote:\n\n- S as the number of small stuffed animals, \n- L as the number of large stuffed animals,\n\nAccording to the problem, we know:\n\n1. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one. So we have: Price of L = 3 * Price of S.\n2. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. So we have: S = 2 * L.\n3. From her sales, Teresa earned $1200. As we know the price of each small and large stuffed animal, we can express this as: S * Price of S + L * Price of L = $1200.\n\nUsing these equations, we want to solve for S:\n\n1. Replace L in equation 2 with the value from equation 1. So, we get: S = 2 * (S / 2), which simplifies to S = S. This doesn't provide us new information but affirms that we used the second condition effectively.\n2. In equation 3, replace S from equation 2 and Price of L from equation 1. \n\nThis would allow us to find S, the number of small stuffed animals."

The total revenue (T) from sales is $1200.\n\nWe can form the equation for total revenue from sales as: T = S*Ps + L*Pl.\n\nWe replace S from equation 3 and Pl from information 2 in the above equation.

      "content": "10\n\nIt looks like Agent_Code_Executor has correctly implemented the proposed solution and found that Teresa sold 10 small stuffed animals. But, to be sure, let's review the solution again:\n\nThe Problem Solver proposed the equation:\n\nT = S * Ps + L * Pl\n\nWhere:\n- T: total revenue\n- S: number of small stuffed animals\n- Ps: price of a small stuffed animal\n- L: number of large stuffed animals\n- Pl: price of a large stuffed animal\n\nGiven:\n1. The price of a small stuffed animal (Ps) is $40.\n2. The price of a large stuffed animal (Pl) is 3 * Ps = $120.\n3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large (S = 2 * L).\n4. The total revenue from sales is $1200.\n\nReplacing S and Pl:\n\nT = S * Ps + L * Pl\n=> 1200 = (2 * L) * 40 + L * 120\n\nThis equation was solved by the Code Executor to find that L equals 5. Then, he calculated S = 2 * L to get that Teresa sold 10 small stuffed animals. This solution is accurate and valid based on the given variables from the problem. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10}"
