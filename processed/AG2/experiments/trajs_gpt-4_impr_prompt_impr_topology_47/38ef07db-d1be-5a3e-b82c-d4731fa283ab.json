The formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle is: \n\nPerimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the Length is 20.5 feet and the Width is 15.5 feet. \n\nSo we plug those values into the formula above:  \n\nPerimeter = 2 * (20.5 ft + 15.5 ft)  \nThis can be simplified further to find the answer. \n\nLet's execute above steps to calculate the total length of crepe paper James needs."
