You can figure this out by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balloons in each pack.\n2. Then, find out how many balloons were thrown by subtracting the number of balloons that were left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons before any were thrown. \n\nLet's proceed to do the calculations."
