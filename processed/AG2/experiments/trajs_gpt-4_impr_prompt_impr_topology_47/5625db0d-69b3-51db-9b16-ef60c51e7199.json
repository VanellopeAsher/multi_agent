      "content": "My solution to this problem goes as follows:\n\n1) First, calculate the total price of apples Clara bought. This is done by multiplying the quantity (15) by the price per apple ($15). This gives us the initial total cost.\n\n2) Subtract Clara's voucher from the total initial cost. This gives us the final price Clara paid for her apples.\n\n3) To get the total cost of the apples Sheila bought, we perform a similar calculation. Multiply the quantity of apples (15) she bought by the price per apple on the second day ($25). \n\n4) After getting the initial total cost for Sheila, we calculate how much she saves from the 15% discount. This is done by multiplying the initial total cost by 15/100. \n\n5) Subtract the discounted amount from the initial total cost to get the final price Sheila paid for her apples.\n\n6) The difference in price between the two days is then obtained by subtracting Clara's final price from Sheila's final price. \n\nAgent Code Executor, please create the python code to solve this problem."

Meanwhile, Sheila paid a total of $318.75 for her apples after the 15% discount was applied. The difference in the final prices paid for the apples on the two distinct days is $318.75 - $222, which equals to $96.75. This means that Sheila paid $96.75 more than Clara for the same quantity of apples due to the price increase and discount considerations. \n\nBoth Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor solutions agree on the final answer, which I can verify is correct. \n\nTherefore, the final solution is: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{96.75}**."
