In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

My job as Agent Verifier is to check if this solution is correct - and it is. \n\nThe problem was that Carver is 60 years old, which is 8 years less than twice the age of his son. Therefore, 2 times the son's age - 8 equals 60. By solving this equation for the son's age, we get 34, which matches the solutions provided by both agents. \n\nThus, the final solution is: \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{34}**."
