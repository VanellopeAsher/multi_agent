Now let's write the Python code as you advised and get our solution.\nHere is how you can solve it:\nFirst, the price of a half gallon jar will be $5 - $2 = $3 (since we know that a one-gallon jar is $2 more expensive than a half gallon jar)\nThen, the total money spent on one gallon jars will be $5 * 10 = $50 (as she bought 10 jars of one gallon)\nAlso, the total money spent on half gallon jars will be $3 * 16 = $48 (as she bought 16 jars of half gallon)\nFinally, adding these two amounts will give us the total money she spent. \n\nLet's implement this."
