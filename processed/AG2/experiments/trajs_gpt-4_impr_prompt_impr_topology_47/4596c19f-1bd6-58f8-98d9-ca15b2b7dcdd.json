Calculate the cost of making one jar of the blend:\n   - For the passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12\n   - For the jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12\n   - For the special honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20\n   - So the total cost of making one jar is $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (special honey) = $44\n2. Compute the profit from selling one jar by subtracting the cost of making one jar from the selling price: $50 (selling price) - $44 (cost) = $6.\n3. Multiply this profit per jar by the number of jars sold to find the total profit: 10 jars * $6/jar = $60.\n\nSo, Tim earns a profit of $60 from selling 10 jars of this blend."
