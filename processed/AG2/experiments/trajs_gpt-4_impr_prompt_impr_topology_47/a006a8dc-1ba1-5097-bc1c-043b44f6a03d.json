There were the same number of girls as boys, meaning the group of kids was divided evenly into two groups of 10.\n\n2. Each boy collected 60 seashells.\n\n3. Each girl collected an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus an extra 4.5 times the amount of shells brought by each boy.\n\nHere are the step-by-step calculations:\n\n1. We know that each boy brought 60 seashells.\n\n2. According to the problem, each girl collected the seashells equal to what the boys gathered (60) plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys gathered (60). This calculation would be: 60 (the shells gathered by the boys) + 4.5 * 60 (4.5 times the amount that each boy gathered).\n\n3. This would give us the number of seashells collected by each girl. \n\nLet's calculate it. "
