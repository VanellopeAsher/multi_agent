Scarlett spent $10.00 on the fish tank.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the price per packet of stones by the number of packets to get the total cost of the stones. Two packets of stones at $2.50 each makes a total of $5.00.\n\nStep 3: Similar to step 2, calculate the total cost for the corals: three pieces at $2.00 each, which comes to $6.00.\n\nStep 4: Repeat the procedure for the fish. Twenty fish at $0.50 each gives a total of $10.00.\n\nStep 5: Add the cost of the fish food to the total. The fish food costs $2.00.\n\nStep 6: Add up all these totals to get the final amount that Scarlett spent. These include: the cost of the fish tank, stones, corals, fish, and fish food."
