Then, she wrote half the alphabet once\n3. After that, she rewrote everything she had already written\n\nTo calculate the total number of letters written by Elise, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Add up the total number of letters written in the first three full repetitions of the alphabet plus half of the alphabet. To get this, multiply the number of letters in the alphabet (26) by the number of times it was written (3) then add half the number of what is written (26/2).\n\nStep 2: Do it once again because Elise rewrote everything that she had already written.\n\nFinally, you will get the total number of letters written by Elise."

So to calculate the total number of letters Elise wrote:\n\n- We first need to calculate the number of letters that Elise wrote before she started rewriting everything. This is done as follows:\n     * The number of letters in the full alphabet (26) times the number of times Elise wrote it in full (3)\n     * Plus half of the alphabet\n- We then multiply this total by 2 (since Elise rewrote everything).\n\nWe can do this calculation using Python code:"

Let's summarize the solution.\n\nAgent Problem Solver provided step-by-step written instruction to solve the problem while Agent Code Executor provided the Python code for the same solution. \n\nBoth the solutions propose the following steps:\n- First, calculate the total number of letters written by Elise. This is the sum of 3 times the number of full alphabets and once half the alphabet. \n- Then, considering that Elise rewrote everything she had written, the total number of letters written by Elise would be double of what she initially wrote.\n  \nThe Python code given executed successfully and the output was 182. This agrees with the approach provided by both agents. Hence, Elise wrote a total of 182 letters."
