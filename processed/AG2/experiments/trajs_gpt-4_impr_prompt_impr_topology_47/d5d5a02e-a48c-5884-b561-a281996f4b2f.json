      "content": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother when he turns 26. According to the problem, Emil will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. In form of equation, this translates to:\n\n    - Emil's dad's age when Emil is 26 = 2 * 26 = 52\n    - Emil's brother's age when Emil is 26 = 26 / 2 = 13\n\n2. Next, we find out how old Emil's dad and brother are currently. Since Emil is 21 now and will turn 26 in 5 years, we can find out their current ages by subtracting 5 from their future ages (when Emil is 26). This gives us:\n\n    - Emil's dad's current age = 52 - 5 = 47\n    - Emil's brother's current age = 13 - 5 = 8\n\n3. Finally, we find out the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother by adding their current ages:\n\n    - The sum of Emil's dad and brother's ages = 47 + 8 = 55\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 55."

      "content": "Let's solve this problem using Python code following the steps outlined by Agent Problem Solver.\n\nFirst, calculate the ages of Emil's dad and his brother when Emil is 26. Then, by subtracting 5 years (the time until Emil is 26), we can find out their current ages. Finally, sum these two values to find the current total age of Emil's dad and his brother. \n\nLet's execute this now:\n\n```python\n# Define Emil's age at 26 (in years)\nemil_age = 26 \n\n# Calculate Emil's dad's age when Emil is 26 (in years)\ndad_age_future = 2 * emil_age \n\n# Calculate Emil's brother's age when Emil is 26 (in years)\nbrother_age_future = emil_age / 2 \n\n# Calculate Emil's dad's current age (in years)\ndad_age_now = dad_age_future - 5 \n\n# Calculate Emil's brother's current age (in years)\nbrother_age_now = brother_age_future - 5 \n\n# Calculate the sum of Emil's dad and brother's ages\ntotal_age = dad_age_now + brother_age_now \n\n# Print the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\nLet's now run this Python code to find the final answer.

      "content": "The proposed solutions from both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor are based on the direct proportions provided in the original problem, and they took note of the given variable (Emil's current age). Their solutions also arrived at the same numerical result which suggests they were correctly calculated based on valid considerations. \n\nNow, both equations (Emil's father being twice Emil's age when he's 26 and Emil being twice his brother's age when he's 26) are indeed satisfied with this result: when Emil is 26, his dad will be 52 (twice Emil's age), and his brother will be 13 (half Emil's age).\n\nSo, based on the solutions provided by the agents and the evaluation of those solutions, we can conclude the sum of Emil's dad's and brother's current ages is 55.\n\nFinal solution declaration: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{55}**."
