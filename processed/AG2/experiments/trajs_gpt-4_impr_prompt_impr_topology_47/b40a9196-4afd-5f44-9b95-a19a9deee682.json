      "content": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Identify the items that are not food: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The total cost of these items is 3+3+4 = 10 dollars.\n\n2. Calculate the tax applied to these items: 10% of 10 dollars equals 1 dollar.\n\n3. Add up the cost of all the items (including tax on non-food items): 2 (milk) + 3 (eggs) + 3 (light bulbs) + 3 (cups) + 4 (roach traps) + 1 (tax) equals 16 dollars.\n\n4. Hence, the total cost of all the items, including tax, is 16 dollars."
