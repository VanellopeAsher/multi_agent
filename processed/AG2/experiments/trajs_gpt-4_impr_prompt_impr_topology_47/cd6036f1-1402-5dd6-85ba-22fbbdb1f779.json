      "content": "Let's break this problem down into steps:\n\n1. Mark lost weight for 3 months, losing 10 pounds each month. Altogether, Mark lost 3 months × 10 pounds/month = 30 pounds.\n2. During his recovery, Mark regained weight for 2 months, gaining 5 pounds each month. So, Mark regained 2 months × 5 pounds/month = 10 pounds.\n3. To find his initial weight we need to take his final weight after recovery, undo the weight he regained, and then undo the weight he lost. This gets us back to his weight before he fell ill. So his initial weight was: final weight + weight lost - weight regained.\n\nNow we just need to fill in the numbers:\n\nInitial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds - 10 pounds = 90 pounds. \n\nSo, Mark initially weighed 90 pounds."

During his illness, he lost weight, and during his recovery, he regained some of it. \n\nTo calculate his initial weight:\n - We sum up the weight he lost during his ill period.\n - We subtract the weight he regained during recovery from the above sum.\n - Finally, we add this result to his final weight after recovery.\n\nConsidering that:\n - He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that is a total of 3*10 = 30 pounds lost.\n - He regained 5 pounds each month for 2 months, so he regained 2*5 = 10 pounds.\n - His final weight after recovery was 70 pounds.\n\nHence, his initial weight will be the sum of his final weight after recovery, the weight he lost, and subtracting the weight regained.\n\nLet's implement this in Python."

Accounting for these changes from his final weight of 70 pounds after recovery, it's clear that his starting weight was 90 pounds. This represents our verified and final conclusion."
