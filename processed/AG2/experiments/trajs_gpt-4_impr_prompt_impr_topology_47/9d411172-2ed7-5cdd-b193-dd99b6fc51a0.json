      "content": "Step 1: Evaluate the cost-per-class when all classes are attended\nLet's first find the cost for attending one class. Given the total cost is $80 and the total number of classes is 12, the cost per class (when all are attended) is $80/12 = $6.66 (approximately) per class.\n\nStep 2: Determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss\nNow that we have the cost per class attended, we can assess how many classes Manny can miss without the cost-per-class rising beyond $20. \n\nTo find this, we can calculate how many classes Manny can attend while keeping the cost-per-class at $20. We can do this by taking the total cost of the classes ($80) divided by the maximum cost-per-class ($20). \n\nThis results in 4 classes. \n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss\nSince Manny can only attend 4 classes before the cost-per-class exceeds $20, this means he can miss 12 total classes - 4 attendable classes = 8 classes. \n\nTherefore, Manny can miss 8 classes before his parents refuse to sign him up again."

      "content": "Both the Problem Solver and the Code Executor have correctly identified that Manny can miss up to 8 classes before his parents refuse to sign him up again due to the cost per class exceeding $20. \n\nFirst, they each started by calculating the cost per class if all classes are attended, which doesn't directly answer the question but provides useful context - it shows that if Manny attends all 12 classes, each class would cost approximately $6.66.\n\nThey then considered the scenario where each class costs $20, as specified by the parents - that is, they look at how many classes Manny can attend before the cost of each class reaches this $20 limit. Using the total funds available ($80) and the maximum acceptable cost per class ($20), this gives a result of 4 classes.\n\nFinally, to get the number of classes Manny can miss, the number of classes Manny can attend (4) is subtracted from the total number of classes (12). This results in 8 missed classes, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThus, Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor's solutions are correct and in agreement."
