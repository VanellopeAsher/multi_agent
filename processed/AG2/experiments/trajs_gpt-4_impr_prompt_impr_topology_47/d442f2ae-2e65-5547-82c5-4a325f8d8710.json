He did not buy the horse, so we shouldn't include it in our calculation."

The total amount spent at the market is the sum of the amount spent on goats and cows.\n\nIn Python, this can be performed as follows:\n\n```python\ngoats = 3\ngoat_cost = 500\ncows = 2\ncow_cost = 1500\n\ntotal_cost_goats = goats * goat_cost\n\ntotal_cost_cows = cows * cow_cost\n\ntotal_spent = total_cost_goats + total_cost_cows\n\nprint(total_spent)\n```"

The results are consistent between Agent Problem Solver's step by step calculations and Agent Code Executor's Python-based solution. \n\nBoth approaches followed the logical steps of:\n1. Calculating the total price for each animal type separately.\n2. Adding the totals for each animal type to come up with the total amount spent.\n\nIt is notable that the question of the horse was a distractor since it was not bought. Both problem-solving methods correctly ignored this extraneous information. The validation of the results confirms that John spent $4500 at the market."

The Python code above accurately calculates the total amount John has spent at the market, based on the number of goats and cows he purchased, and their respective prices. It correctly ignores the price of the horse, which was not purchased. Thus, the code execution supports that John spent $4500 at the market. This is a straightforward task, and the agreement of the results produced by different approaches shows the robustness of our solution."

This total is derived from the amount spent on goats ($1500) and cows ($3000).\nThe calculations made are accurate and the logic used to solve this problem is valid. The method employed to solve the problem - breaking it down into smaller parts (cost of goats, cows, and the potential horse purchase) and then combining relevant parts - is effective.\nExcellent work, agents! This discussion has reached a valuable conclusion."

The agreement from all agents solidifies this accurate and straightforward solution. Great teamwork!"
