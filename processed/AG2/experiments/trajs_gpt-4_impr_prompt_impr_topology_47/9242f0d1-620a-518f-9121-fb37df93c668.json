  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

First, add together the prices of each item that she did buy to get the total amount of money she spent.\n2. Then, subtract that total from the original budget of €1500.\n\nItems Elvira bought include:\n- Computer including monitor, keyboard, and mouse: €1090\n- Scanner: €157\n- CD burner: €74\n- Printer: €102\n\nTotal spending = (cost of computer including monitor, keyboard, and mouse) + (cost of scanner) + (cost of CD burner) + (cost of printer) \n                = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102\n\nRemaining money = original budget - total spending\n                     = €1500 - total spending\n\nThis will give us the answer of how much money she still has left to spend on her new outfit. The items she decided not to buy, like the speakers and gaming chair, do not come into this calculation because she didn't buy them."
