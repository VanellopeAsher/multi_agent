We can calculate the total time he spent, from that:\n\n- 15 hours is 30% of the total time, that means the total time (100%) is 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours.\n\nFinally, to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, we subtract the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows from the total time:\n\n- 50 (total time) - 15 (time spent on initial activities) = 35 hours.\n\nSo, John spent 35 hours sightseeing."

B = 6 hours \n2. S = B/2 = 3 hours\n3. W = 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours\n4. B + S + W = 15 hours is 30% of the total time. From this we can calculate T = (B + S + W)/0.3 = 50 hours. \n5. Since sightseeing time is the remaining time, X = T - (B + S + W) = 50 - 15 = 35 hours\n \nTherefore, John spent 35 hours sightseeing during his vacation.
