After three weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall. \n\n4. To find out how much it grew in the third week, we subtract the height after the second week from the height after the third week. So, the growth in the third week is: 10 - 6 = 4 inches.\n\nThe beanstalk grew 4 inches in the third week."

So, we can conclude that our solution is correct based on the information provided. \n\nOur next step would be to apply the same logical breakdown and Python code to similar problems. By adjusting the parameters such as initial height, growth rate, and total height, we can solve a wide range of problems using the same method.\n\nOverall, I believe we have successfully solved the problem. Nice teamwork!"
