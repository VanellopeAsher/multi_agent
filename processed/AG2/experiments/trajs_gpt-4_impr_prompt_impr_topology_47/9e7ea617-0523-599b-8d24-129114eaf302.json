In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

This means that the second tree is 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet tall.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total height of the two shorter trees by adding the height of the shortest tree (60 feet) to the height of the second tree (110 feet). This gives a combined height of 60 feet + 110 feet = 170 feet.\n\nStep 3: Finally, find the height of the tallest tree by multiplying the combined height of the two shorter trees (170 feet) by 2, as the problem states that the tallest tree is twice as tall as the two others combined. This results in a height of 170 feet * 2 = 340 feet for the tallest tree."
