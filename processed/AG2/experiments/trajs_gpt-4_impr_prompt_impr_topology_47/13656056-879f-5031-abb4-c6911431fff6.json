In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

To find out how much Gerald earned in a week, you multiply the amount he earns daily ($300) by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\n2. Subtract the total amount of money Gerald spent ($1000) from the total amount he earned in a week to find out how much money he has left.\n\nThe formula for the solution is:\n\n   (Daily pay * Number of days worked) - Total amount spent = Total amount remaining\n\nRemember, Gerald earns $300 daily and he worked for 7 days. He also spent $1000."
