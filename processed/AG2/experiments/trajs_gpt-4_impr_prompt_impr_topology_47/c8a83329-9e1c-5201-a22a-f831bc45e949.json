In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this, let's follow the below steps:\n\n1) Determine the total number of cards Erica started with.\n2) Subtract the number of cards she gave away.\n3) Add the number of cards she received.\n\nLet's assume each box of pre-made Valentine's cards brought by her dad contains the same amount of cards \"X\". Let's find the unknown \"X\". \n\nOnce we get the total number of cards Erica started with, number of cards she gave away and the number of cards she received. We could then make an equation and solve it. \n\nLet me illustrate this with an example:\n\nStep 1: Total number of cards Erica started with = 20 (she made) + 2 * X (from her dad)\nStep 2: Total number of cards that she gave away = 24 (to her classmates) + 5 (to her family) = 29\nStep 3: Total number of cards that she received = 17\n\nSo, if we make an equation with these values, then:\n\nNumber of cards Erica started with - number of cards she gave away + number of cards received = Final number of cards Erica now have. \n\nLet's put the numerical values, \n\n(20 + 2X - 29 + 17) = number of cards Erica now have. \n\nSo once we know the number of cards in each box (X), we can substitute the value in the equation to find out the final number of cards Erica now have.\n    \nWe can always ask The Code Executor Agent to code these steps and execute the python script. The output of the script would then give the desired answer."

      "content": "We don't have the exact number of Valentine's cards in each box Erica's dad gave her. But we can work around this by using the information we have accurately. \n\nLet's denote X as the number of Valentine's cards in each box. \n\nWe know that Erica made 20 Valentine's cards herself, and then her dad gave her 2 boxes, which totals to the number of cards she had initially as: \ninitial_cards = 20 + 2 * X\n\nThen, we know she gave out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which is: \ngiven_cards = 24 + 5\n\nAnd she also received 17 cards from friends and family:\nreceived_cards = 17\n\nSo, at the end of the day, the number of Valentine's cards Erica has is the total number of cards she initially had, minus the cards given out, plus the cards received. This can be calculated as: \nfinal_cards = initial_cards - given_cards + received_cards\n\nWe can then print the final_cards to have the answer. \n\nWe ask Agent Code Executor to execute this Python code when given the X in the short future, because we won't get the correct number of cards without knowing how many cards were in each box Erica's dad gave her."
