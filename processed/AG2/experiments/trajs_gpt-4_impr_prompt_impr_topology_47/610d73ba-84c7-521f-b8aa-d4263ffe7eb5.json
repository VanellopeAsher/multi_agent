In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Therefore, we can calculate the distance Reggie ran by multiplying the distance Paisley covered (4 miles) by 5.\n\n2. We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So, to get the distance Lynn ran, we can subtract 3 miles from the distance Reggie ran. \n\n3. Based on these computations, we can find out the distance that Lynn ran."
