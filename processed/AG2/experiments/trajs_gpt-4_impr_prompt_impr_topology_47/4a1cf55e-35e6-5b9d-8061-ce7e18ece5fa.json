In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Sure, here's my approach:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the price of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar, and we know a gallon jar costs $5.5, the price of a half-gallon jar will be $5.5 - $2.5 = $3.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total cost for the gallon jars. Cecilia bought 10-gallon jars at $5.5 each. So, the total cost for the gallon jars is 10 * $5.5 = $55.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost for the half-gallon jars. Cecilia bought 16 half-gallon jars at $3 each. So, the total cost for the half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.\n\nStep 4: Finally, calculate the total cost for all jars. This can be done by adding up the total cost for the gallon jars and the total cost for the half-gallon jars. That would be $55 + $48 = $103.\n\nSo, Cecilia spent a total of $103 on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars."

The total cost of gallon jars = num_of_gallon_jars * price_of_gallon_jar\n4. The total cost of half-gallon jars = num_of_half_gallon_jars * price_of_half_gallon_jar\n5.
