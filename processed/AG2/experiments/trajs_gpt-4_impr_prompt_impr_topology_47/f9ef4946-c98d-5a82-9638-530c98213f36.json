On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he had to stay up late over the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes. How many hours did he watch TV in total?",

In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Okay, let's break down this problem day by day.\n\n1. Monday: Frankie watches an hour-long episode, so that's 1 hour.\n2. Tuesday: Again, he watches an hour-long episode, which is another 1 hour.\n3. Wednesday: He watches three 30-minute episodes. Each hour has 60 minutes. Therefore, 3*30 minutes = 90 minutes. But we need it in hours, so 90 minutes is 1.5 hours.\n4. Thursday: He watches an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. That's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n5. Friday: He watches two one-hour episodes. That's 2*1 = 2 hours.\n\nAdding up all the hours: 1 (Mon) + 1 (Tue) + 1.5 (Wed) + 1.5 (Thu) + 2 (Fri) would give us the total number of hours Frankie watched TV in total."

Thus, their solutions have a common ground.\n\nThe total hours that Frankie watched TV are computed by summing up the daily hours:\n\n- Monday: 1 hour\n- Tuesday: 1 hour\n- Wednesday: 1.5 hours\n- Thursday: 1.5 hours\n- Friday: 2 hours\n\nTotal hours = 1 (Mon) + 1 (Tue) + 1.5 (Wed) + 1.5 (Thu) + 2 (Fri) = 7 hours\n\nTherefore, the total number of TV watching hours for Frankie is 7 hours for the given week.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{7}.**"
