Therefore, to calculate the total number of students without a desktop or laptop, multiply 20 by 3, which equals 60 students.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of students.\nWe know that three-fourths of students have a desktop. This translates to 1 - (3/4) = 1/4, or 25% of students do not own a desktop. If 20 students represent this 25%, then it indicates that they are one-quarter of the total student population. Therefore, multiply 20 by 4, to calculate the total number of students.  \n\nLet's execute these steps."

      "content": "At a given grade level, three-fourths, or 75%, of students have a desktop computer at home. This means that 25%, or one-fourth, of students do not have a desktop computer. This is represented by 20 students.\n\nSince this 20 represents one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer at home, we can multiply 20 by 3 to calculate the total number of students not having either a desktop or laptop at home. This gives us a total of 60 students.\n\nHowever, when considering the total number of students in the grade level, we must consider that these 20 students (who do not have a desktop computer) represent 25% of the total number of students. Therefore, to calculate the total number of students, we multiply 20 by 4, which equals 80.\n\nSo, there are 80 students at that grade level in total. This solution seems correct based on the given information - 60 students do not have either type of computer, and 20 students (80 total - 60 without) have at least one type of computer."
