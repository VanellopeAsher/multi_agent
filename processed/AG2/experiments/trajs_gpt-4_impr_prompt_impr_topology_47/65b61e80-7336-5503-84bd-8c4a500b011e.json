In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here's the proposed solution:\n\n1. First, we calculate the total number of eggs the Smith twins found. Since they each found 30 eggs, multiply 30 by 2 to get the total number of eggs they found: `total_eggs_smith_twins = 30 * 2`.\n\n2. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we derive the total number of eggs by adding the number the Smith twins found and the remaining 10: `total_eggs = total_eggs_smith_twins + 10`.\n\n3. We then find out the number of eggs the friends found by subtracting the Smith twins' eggs from the total: `eggs_found_by_friends = total_eggs - total_eggs_smith_twins`.\n\nThe solution is the value from step 3, `eggs_found_by_friends`, which represents the number of eggs the friends found."
