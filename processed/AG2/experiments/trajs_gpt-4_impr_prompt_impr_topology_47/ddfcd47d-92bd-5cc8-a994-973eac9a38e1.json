In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to take the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of money Kassidy has: Given that Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Arelia, we multiply 2/3 by the amount of money Arelia has ($150) to get the money amount for Kassidy.\n\n2. Calculate the amount of money Rayna has: Rayna has $70 more than Kassidy, so we add $70 to the amount of money we calculated for Kassidy.\n\n3. Add all the money amounts together: We add the money amount for Arelia, Kassidy and Rayna. \n\n4. Finally, divide the total money amount by 3 (because they want to share the total amount equally) to get the amount of money each would have. \n\nYou are encouraged to perform these calculations to get the final answer."
