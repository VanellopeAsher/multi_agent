      "content": "The solution to this problem can be found by following these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs used per day: Claire uses 3 eggs to make her omelet every morning.\n\n2. Find the number of eggs she consumes in a week: Multiply the number of eggs she uses each day by 7, the number of days in a week. This gives us 21 eggs.\n\n3. Calculate how many eggs she eats over the 12-week period: Multiply the number of eggs she consumes weekly by 12 to get the total number of eggs she consumes in 12 weeks. This gives us a total of 252 eggs.\n\n4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens: Finally, divide the total number of eggs by 12, since a dozen contains 12 items. This gives us the total number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks.\n\nI will leave the exact calculations to Agent Code Executor."

According to their solution, Claire will need 21 dozens of eggs to make her 3-egg omelette every morning for 12 weeks. \n\nLet's summarize the steps taken:\n\n1. We identified that Claire used 3 eggs each day for her omelette.\n2. This was multiplied by 7 to identify the number of eggs utilized in a week (3*7 = 21 eggs).\n3. The weekly egg consumption was then multiplied by 12 to find the total number of eggs she would need for 12 weeks (21*12 = 252 eggs).\n4. Finally, we divided the total by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen) to find the number of dozens of eggs Claire would need for her 12 weeks of omelettes (252/12 = 21 dozens).\n\nWith the problem-solving and computational capacities of Agents Problem Solver and Code Executor, we concluded that Claire would need 21 dozens of eggs for her breakfast omelettes over a 12 week period."
