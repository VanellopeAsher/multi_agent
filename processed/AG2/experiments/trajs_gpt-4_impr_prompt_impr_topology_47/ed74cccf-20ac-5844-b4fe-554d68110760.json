In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

The actual total could be higher if there are more students playing soccer. The minimum total would be:\n\nMinimum total number of students = 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 22 (soccer girls) = 40\n\nSo, there are at least 40 students in total. However, if additional students are playing soccer, the total would be higher."

The agents correctly used the number of students playing each sport to find a solution. Agent Problem Solver added that the number of soccer players might be higher as we only know about the girls playing soccer and not if any boys are participating. Agent Code Executor confirmed the same calculation with Python code, and the output was identical.\n\nBoth agents' solutions are based on the same arguments, and there is no discrepancy between them. As a summary, there are at least 40 students based on the given information with the possibility of more if boys are also playing soccer.\n\nFINAL SOLUTION_FOUND  \\boxed{40}."
