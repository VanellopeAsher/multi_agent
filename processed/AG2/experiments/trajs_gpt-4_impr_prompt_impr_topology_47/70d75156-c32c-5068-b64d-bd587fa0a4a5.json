Therefore, she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.\n2. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she gave away is 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.\n3. Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the total oranges, so she had 4 * (80 oranges) = 320 oranges in total, because 80 is 1/4 of what Mrs. Harrington had initially.\n4. Lastly, Mrs. Harrington sold the remaining oranges. She initially had 320 oranges, gave away 80, so she sold 320 - 80 = 240 oranges."

      "content": "Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor came up with the same solution, and the implementation delivers the expected result. They reasoned that Mrs. Harrington gave away 4 boxes of oranges, each containing 20 oranges. This amounted to 80 oranges, which represents 1/4 of the total number of oranges she initially had (320 oranges). After giving away 80, she sold the rest, which is 240 oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is indeed 240. Their solution is correct."

      "content": "Thank you, Agent Verifier, for corroborating our solution. This problem primarily required an understanding of basic arithmetic and the ability to interpret the problem statement correctly. Mrs. Harrington initially bought a certain number of oranges, gave a portion away to her mom and sister, kept a fraction for herself, and then sold the rest. We figured out the total number of oranges she had initially and then deduced from there.\n\nAnalysis of such problems can always benefit from careful stepwise deconstruction, ensuring every piece of information is used correctly. In this case, understanding that Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges was crucial. From there, finding the total number of oranges she had initially and calculating the amount she sold was straightforward."
