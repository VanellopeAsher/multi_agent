If two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female and equal to 6, then the total number of unicorns in Scotland is 9 (6 divided by two-thirds equals 9).\n2. If a third of all the unicorns are in Scotland, then the total number of unicorns in the world is 27 (9 times 3), given the situation that the number of unicorns in Scotland represents a third of the total number of unicorns.\n3. Based on this, the number of unicorns left in the world outside Scotland can be calculated by subtracting the number of unicorns in Scotland from the total number of unicorns. So, this results in 27 minus 9 equals 18 unicorns.\n\nTherefore, there are 18 unicorns left in the world outside Scotland."

From here, it was established that the total number of unicorns is 27 since Scottish unicorns comprise 1/3 of this global total. The count of unicorns outside Scotland was then obtained by subtracting the Scottish count from the global count, leading to an answer of 18 unicorns outside Scotland.\n\nThe Python code provided by the Agent Code Executor essentially follows these same steps to calculate the number of unicorns outside Scotland, and subsequently verifies the solution given by Agent Problem Solver. As such, we can confidently confirm that there are 18 unicorns outside Scotland."

The problem was solved correctly, and the solution was verified successfully with the executed Python code. \n\nTo summarize, the problem states that two-thirds of unicorns in Scotland are females, and there are 6 female unicorns. Based on this, it's possible to calculate the total number of unicorns in Scotland (9 unicorns). If these 9 unicorns represent one-third of all unicorns worldwide, then the total number of unicorns worldwide is 27. Therefore, the number of unicorns outside Scotland is 18 (27-9).\n\nSo, the final answer to the question \"how many unicorns are left in the world outside Scotland?\" is 18 unicorns, and this has been confirmed with Python code execution.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Chat Manager"
