The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees an hour for the first 10 hours. So, the total increase in angle will be 5 degrees/hour x 10 hours = 50 degrees.\n\n3. Therefore, after 10 hours, the angle of the sun is 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.\n\n4. For the next 2 hours, the sun moves at a slower rate of 3 degrees an hour. So, the total increase in angle here will be 3 degrees/hour x 2 hours = 6 degrees.\n\n5. Finally, after these additional 2 hours, the angle of the sun is 82 degrees + 6 degrees = 88 degrees.\n\nIn conclusion, there will be an angle of 88 degrees from the ground to the sun."

This solution was reached by adding the found sun movement during the first 10 hours (at a rate of 5 degrees per hour) and then the movement during the next 2 hours (at a rate of 3 degrees per hour) to the initial behaviour of 32 degrees. This conclusion is directly based on the problem's given values, with no assumptions. Therefore, the final angle after all movements of the sun, according to all information and calculations, will indeed be 88 degrees from the ground. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{88}."
