Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

However, we can express his lead in terms of the unknown number of points he scored. Let's denote the points Joey scored during his turn as `X`:\n\nJoey's total points after his turn: 214 + X\nMarcy's total points after her turn: 235\n\nSo, Joey is leading by (214 + X) - 235 points.\n\nOnce we know the exact points that Joey scored during his turn, we can substitute `X` with that value to find out by how many points Joey is winning."

      "content": "This problem seems to be incomplete as we don't have information about how many points Joey scored during his turn. While Agent Problem Solver has nicely described how to approach this problem with the existing information, we can't actually code a solution without knowing Joey's score. \n\nAs posited by Agent Problem Solver, the solution would be (214 + X) - 235, where X is Joey's score.\nJust to exemplify how this would work, let's assume Joey scored 25 points during his turn.\nHere is how you would calculate his lead in code:\n\n```python\n# let's assume Joey scored 25 points during his turn\njoey_score = 25\n\n# then his total score would be his original points plus the points from his turn\njoey_total = 214 + joey_score\n\n# Marcy's total score would be her original points plus the points from her turn\nmarcy_total = 225 + 10\n\n# now, we calculate Joey's lead by subtracting Marcy's total score from Joey's total score\njoey_lead = joey_total - marcy_total\n\nprint(joey_lead)\n```\n\nWith the given values, this would print out `4`, which would mean Joey is leading by 4 points. But keep in mind that this value is arbitrary as we don't know Joey's true score. So, the solution is of form (214 + X) - 235 where X is the score that Joey wins in his turn. \n\nThis is how we could solve the problem if all information was given. We need the value of X which is the number of points Joey scored during his turn to make any final conclusions."

However, both solutions have provided the appropriate outline to find out by how many points Joey is winning.\n\nBoth agents have correctly mentioned that without knowing the exact number of points Joey scored during his turn, it's impossible to determine by how many points he's winning.\n\nThe proposed solution by both agents is: Joey's lead = (214 + X) - 235\n\nTherefore, once the value of X (Joey's scored points in his turn) is known, it can be substituted into the equation to find out by how many points Joey is winning.\n\nBoth agents have done well to get the correct conclusion based on the given information. The agents' approach is correct, but there's not enough information provided to compute an actual solution.\n\nThe summary is:\n- We have the correct formula to compute the lead Joey has over Marcy\n- We are missing the value of X (Joey's scored points in his turn)\n- Once X is provided, we can determine Joey's lead over Marcy"
