In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

When we take these three days together, we find that Sam ran 10.5 miles (3.5 miles x 3).\n\n2. On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5.5 miles each day. This sums up to 11 miles (5.5 miles x 2).\n\n3. Now, to find the total miles run in the week, we add the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday. \n\n4. This gives us 21.5 miles (10.5 miles + 11 miles) in total for the week. \n\nSo, Sam ran 21.5 miles during the week."
