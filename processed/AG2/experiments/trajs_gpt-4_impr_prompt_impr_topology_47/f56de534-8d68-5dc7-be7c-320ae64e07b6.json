In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here is the breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. Johnny dumps a lego box of 500 pieces\n2. He also dumps another lego box that has 3 times the pieces of the first one, which is 500 * 3 = 1500 pieces\n3. He dumps a third lego box which has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which is 500 / 4 = 125 pieces\n4. He dumps a fourth lego box that has 125 more pieces than the first one, which is 500 + 125 = 625 pieces\n\nThe total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is therefore: 500 (first box) + 1500 (second box) + 125 (third box) + 625 (fourth box) = 2750 pieces. \n\nSo Johnny picks up a total of 2750 lego pieces. \n\nLet's now discuss this solution, and possibly have it confirmed by Agent Code Executor."

Store the piece count of the first lego set in a variable named 'first_set'.\n2. Smultiply the 'first_set' variable by 3 and store the result in a variable named 'second_set'.\n3. Divide the 'first_set' variable by 4 and store the result in a variable named 'third_set'.\n4. Add 125 to the 'first_set' variable and store the result in a variable named 'fourth_set'.\n5. Lastly, calculate the sum of all the variables to get the total number of pieces Johnny has to pick up. \n\nLet's execute these steps now."
