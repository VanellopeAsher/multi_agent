      "content": "STEP 1: Determine the total time spent by John\nWe know that John spent 6.6 hours boating, half that time swimming, and watched 3 shows that each lasted 2.5 hours. Therefore:\n\nTotal time spent = Time spent boating + Time spent swimming + Time spent watching shows\n\nGiven that he spent half the boating time swimming:\n\nTime spent swimming = 0.5 * Time spent boating = 0.5 * 6.6 hours = 3.3 hours\n\nAnd given that he watched 3 shows each of 2.5 hours:\n\nTime spent watching shows = Number of shows * Duration of each show = 3 shows * 2.5 hours/show = 7.5 hours\n\nSo,\n\nTotal time spent = 6.6 hours (boating) + 3.3 hours (swimming) + 7.5 hours (watching shows)\nTotal time spent = 17.4 hours\n\nSTEP 2: Find out 100% of the total time\nAccording to the problem, the time spent on the three activities accounts for 30% of the total time spent. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to solve for 100% of his time.\n\nLet T denote the total time (100%):\n\n30% of T = 17.4 hours\nT (100%) = (17.4 * 100) / 30 hours\n\nSTEP 3: Calculate the time spent sightseeing\nWe know that sightseeing represents 40% of his total time available. Therefore, after we find T from Step 2, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing as:\n\nTime spent sightseeing = 0.4 * T\n\nThe result from the above calculation will give the time John spent sightseeing. \n\nConsidering these steps, we can calculate how much time John spent sightseeing."

By analyzing both given solutions, it is evident that Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor follow the same logic and steps to arrive at the same answer. Thus, it's safe to conclude that John spent approximately 23.2 hours sightseeing based on both found solutions. As the output indicates 23.200000000000003, this tiny fraction above 23.2 is due to computer representation and calculation of fractions. Therefore, it can be safely rounded to 23.2."
