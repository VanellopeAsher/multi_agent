They used the ratio of potatoes to hash browns (60:360), which simplifies to 1:6, meaning that each potato can make 6 hash browns. They then multiplied this ratio by the total number of available potatoes, which is 960.\n\nAgent Code Executor successfully executed the code based on the correct solution provided by Agent Problem Solver. The code confirmed that 960 potatoes would produce 5760 hash browns.\n\nThe critical evaluation of the solutions proposed by both agents indicates that they are correct.\n\nHence, the final solution is :\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5760}."
