Find the total number of bucks:\n    - 30% of the total number of deer are bucks. Since total number of deer = 80, number of bucks = 30% of 80. \n\n2. Find the number of 6 point bucks:\n    - 50% of the bucks are 6 points. So, number of 6 point bucks = 50% of the number of bucks.\n\nLet me calculate it."
