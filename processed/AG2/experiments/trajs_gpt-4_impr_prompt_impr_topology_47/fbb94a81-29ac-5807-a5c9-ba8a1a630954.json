This we can express as:\n\n   P + Pa + J = 100\n\nStep 3: Insert the known relationships into the equation.\n\nWe also know that \"Paul is 18 years older than John\". Expressed as an equation, we get:\n\n   Pa = J + 18\n\nNext, we know that \"Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age\". This we can rewrite as:\n\n   P = Pa + J\n\nWe can substitute the two relationships into our original equation.\n\nStep 4: Solve for P.\n\nP = (J+18) + J\n\nStep 5: Substitute for P in the age sum equation.\n\n(J+18) + J + J = 100\n\nFrom this equation, we should be able to find the value of J and substitute it back into the equations to find the other values. \n\nThis should help us find the solution."
