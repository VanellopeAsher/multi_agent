In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here's my proposed solution to the problem:\n\nStep 1: Figure out the total square feet of fabric from the medium and large shirts. Multiply the number of each type by the square footage they each take up, and add those numbers together.\n\nStep 2: To find out how many square feet the small shirts are, subtract the total from the medium and large from the total size of the quilt.\n\nStep 3: Divide the result from step 2 by the square footage of the small shirts to find out how many were used. \n\nNow let's run these steps:\n\n1. The total square feet of the medium and large shirts is: \n\n   (8 Medium Shirts * 4 square feet) + (6 Large Shirts * 6 square feet) = 32 + 36 = 68 square feet. \n\n2. The total square feet of the small shirts is then:\n\n   101 (Total Square Feet of quilt) - 68  (Total Square Feet of medium and large shirts) = 33 square feet. \n\n3. The number of small shirts used is then:\n\n   33 (Total Square Feet of small shirts) / 3 (Square Feet per small shirt) = 11 small shirts.\n\nSo, Octavia used 11 small shirts to make the quilt."

They have both used the provided variables (the size of the quilt and the size and the number of medium and large t-shirts used) correctly, without making any assumptions.
