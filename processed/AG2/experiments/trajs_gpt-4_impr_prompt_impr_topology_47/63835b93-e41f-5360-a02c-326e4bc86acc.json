In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "My solution to this problem involves a simple calculation:\n\n1. We need to sum up all the costs, so we add:\n\n    a. The cost of neutering the kitten.\n    \n    b. The cost of the two vaccines (the price of one vaccine * 2).\n    \n    c. The cost of the broken vases (the price of one vase * 3).\n\nLet's substitute the values provided into our equation:\n\n• The cost for neutering is $150.\n• Each vaccine costs $30, and the kitten got 2 vaccines. So the total cost for vaccines is $30 * 2 = $60.\n• Each vase costs $15, and the kitten broke 3 vases. So the total cost for the broken vases is $15 * 3 = $45.\n\nAt the end, we sum all the costs:\n\nTotal cost = Cost for neutering + Cost for vaccines + Cost for broken vases\n\nThat is $150 + $60 + $45 = $255\n\nSo, the kitten has cost Leah $255 so far. Let's check this with the Agent that can execute Python code."
