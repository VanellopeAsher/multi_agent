The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so he is 2 * 12 = 24 years old.\n\n4.

There were no assumptions made, and the computations align perfectly: the total age for the sisters was calculated as 160 years, the younger brother is 12, and the older brother - being twice as old - is 24. Adding them all up gives us 196 years as the total age.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{196}** \nThis is the final solution - the total age of all the siblings is 196 years."
