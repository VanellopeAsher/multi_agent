This means if Sam and Harry were to get an equal share of the fence, each would get 100 feet.\n\nSTEP 3: Take into account that Harry is getting 80 feet more than Sam\nTo fulfill this condition, we have to take 80 feet from Sam's portion and give it to Harry. This means that Sam gets 100 - 80 = 20 feet of the fence.\n\nSo, Sam is left with 20 feet of the fence."

Compute the half of `total_fence` and store the value in `equal_share`.\n3. As it is given that Harry's share is 80 feet more than Sam, we subtract 80 from the `equal_share` to get Sam's portion of the fence.\n\nLet's calculate this.\n\n```python\n# Define the total length of fence\ntotal_fence = 200\n\n# Compute the equal share by dividing the total fence length by 2\nequal_share = total_fence / 2 \n\n# Compute Sam's Share\nsam_share = equal_share - 80\n\nprint(sam_share)\n```"
