In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

In this case, it would be 90 - 30 = 60.\n\nStep 2: Figure out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 55 from Richie's score, as Richie scored 55 more than Anna. This means Anna's score would be 90 - 55 = 35.\n\nStep 3: To get the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, add all their scores together. Therefore, total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals = 90 + 60 + 35. \n\nThis leads us to the solution."
