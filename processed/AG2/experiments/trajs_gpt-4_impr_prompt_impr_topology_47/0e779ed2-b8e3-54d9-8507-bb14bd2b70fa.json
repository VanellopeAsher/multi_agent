      "content": "The first step to solve this problem is to identify the ages of each sibling. We can figure this out by using the given information:\n\n1) The sisters' age is 1.6 times of ten, this means each sister is 1.6*10 = 16 years old and since there are 3 sisters, the total age of the sisters is 3*16 = 48 years.\n\n2) One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years, this translates to 3/5*20 = 12 years.\n\n3) Also, given that the younger brother is half of what the older brother's age is, we can infer that the older brother is 12*2 = 24 years old.\n\nThe final step to find the total ages of all the siblings is to sum up all their ages. This is executed by adding 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years. Meaning, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."

Hence,\nyounger_brother_age = (3/5) * 20\n\n# Given that, the younger brother's age is half the age of the older brother, hence,\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Now, let's calculate the total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_sisters_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nWhen you run this Python code, it will calculate the total age of all siblings which is expected to be 84 years."
