So we deduct these remaining balloons from the total number to find out how many balloons were used. \n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Multiply the number of sets by the number of balloons in each set to get the total number of balloons. \n2. Subtract the remaining number of balloons from the total number of balloons. The result is the number of balloons used.\n\nLet's execute these steps."
