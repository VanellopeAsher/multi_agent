The cost of potato fries: Ten packs of fries cost $0.30 each so the total for fries is 10 * $0.30 = $3.\n\n3. The cost of fruit drinks is not mentioned in the problem. To proceed, we need this information.\n\nOnce we know the cost of the fruit drinks, we can add up the cost of the hamburgers, the fries, and the fruit drinks, and subtract this total from the amount Carly gave to find the amount of change she should receive."

Calculating the cost for every item separately.\n\n    - Five hamburgers at $4 each give us a total of 5 * $4 = $20.\n    - Ten packs of fries at $0.30 each give us a total of 10 * $0.30 = $3.\n    - And finally, five fruit drinks at $2 each give us a total of 5 * $2 = $10.\n\n2. Summing up all the costs to get the total cost which is $20(for hamburgers) + $3(for fries) + $10(for drinks) = $33.\n\n3. Calculating the change which is the difference between the amount Carly gave ($50) and the total cost ($33). So, the change would be $50 - $33 = $17.\n\nThis process determines that Carly will receive $17 in change."

The cost for each item was calculated separately. The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each was $20; ten packs of fries at $0.30 each summed up to $3; and five fruit drinks at $2 each amounted to $10.\n\n2. All costs were added up to get the total â€“ $20 (for hamburgers) plus $3 (for fries) plus $10 (for drinks), which equals $33.\n\n3. Lastly, to calculate the change, the total cost ($33) was subtracted from the amount Carly tendered ($50) resulting in $17.  \n\nTherefore, the final solution is that Carly will get back $17 in change.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{17}"
