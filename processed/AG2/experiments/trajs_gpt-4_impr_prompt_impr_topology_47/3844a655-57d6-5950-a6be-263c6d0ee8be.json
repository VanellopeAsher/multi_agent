While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the cost model of each venue. \n\n1. For the first venue, the total cost is the sum of the flat fee and the per-person food cost. Thus, its cost can be represented by the equation C1 = 2000 + 50p, where p is the number of people attending. \n\n2. For the second venue, the cost is simply a per-person fee that already includes food. So, its cost can be represented by the equation C2 = 250p.\n\nAt the point where the two costs are equal:\n\n2000 + 50p = 250p\n\nThis equation is a simple linear equation and it can be solved for p (the number of guests) to find the point of equilibrium where the two venues are equal in cost. \n\nBy rearranging the equation:\n\n2000 + 50p = 250p  \n\nCan be simplified to:\n\n2000 = 200p\n\nThen:\n\np = 2000 / 200\n\nCalculate the value of p. This value represents the number of guests at which the cost of both options is the same.\n"
