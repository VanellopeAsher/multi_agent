Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",

Subtract the given and kept cards from the total.\n3. Lastly, to find the number of students, divide the remaining number of cards by the number of cards each student got.\n\nLet's plug into the figures provided into these steps and solve the problem."
