      "content": "First, let's understand the problem: Polly can throw the javelin a distance of 4000 feet, but when holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times as far. We want to find out how far from the dragon's reach (which is 10000 feet) Polly can stand and still be able to hit the dragon.\n\nHere are the steps to solve it:\n\n1. Calculate how far Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. This is three times her normal distance, so we multiply 4000 feet by 3 to get 12000 feet.\n2. Subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin. This gives us the distance outside the dragon's reach that Polly can stand and still be able to hit the dragon, i.e., 12000 feet - 10000 feet = 2000 feet.\n\nSo, if holding the gemstone, Polly can stand up to 2000 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit Perg with the gold javelin."
