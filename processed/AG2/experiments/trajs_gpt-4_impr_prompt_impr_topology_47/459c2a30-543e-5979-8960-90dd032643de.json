This gives us the number of white squares. \n\nSTEP 3: Subtract the total number of white squares from the total number of green squares to determine how much fewer white squares are than green squares. \n\nThis solution can be calculated using arithmetic or with the help of a simple computer program. I personally prefer using a computer program for such calculations, as it allows to avoid potential arithmetic errors."
