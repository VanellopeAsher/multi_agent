      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. After deducting the number of days Billy takes off, we can find out the total number of days Billy helps people.\n\nThere are 31 days in March, and April 19th is the 19th day of April, so the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\nIf Billy takes 20% of these 50 days off, the number of days he takes off is 50 * 0.2 = 10 days. \n\nSo, the total number of days Billy helps people with their taxes is 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\nBilly helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so the total number of people he helps is 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day * 40 days = 240 people.\n\nAs for the caffeine consumption, Billy takes a 15-minute break every hour to drink a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine. Since he works for 3 hours a day, this means that he takes 3 breaks to drink coffee. Thus, he consumes 95 milligrams of caffeine * 3 cups = 285 milligrams of caffeine per day.\n\nBecause he works for 40 days, the total amount of caffeine he consumes over these 40 working days is 285 milligrams/day * 40 days = 11400 milligrams.\n\nBy putting together all the time he spends doing taxes, drinking coffee and organizing paperwork, a day of work for Billy is 3 hours of helping people + (3 * 15 minutes) of coffee breaks + 30 minutes of paperwork = 3.5 hours. \n\nSo over 40 days, he spends 3.5 hours/day * 40 days = 140 hours."
