      "content": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many brownies Greta had in total during the day. \n    - Greta made a batch for herself; consisting of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since a dozen is equal to 12, Greta had 12 brownies.\n    - At her office, they gave her another 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6, she got an additional 6 brownies.\n    - Greta's friends had made 4 dozen brownies for the surprise party. Since a dozen is equal to 12, the number of brownies her friends made for the party is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.\n    - In total, Greta had 12 (her own batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friend's party) = 66 brownies during the day.\n2. However, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten during the party. To find out how many brownies were eaten, we need to multiply 1.5 (which represents 1 1/2) by 12 (since a dozen is equal to 12). Hence, 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies were eaten during the party.\n3. To find out how many brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies. Hence, 66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten brownies) = 48 brownies.\n\nSo, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
