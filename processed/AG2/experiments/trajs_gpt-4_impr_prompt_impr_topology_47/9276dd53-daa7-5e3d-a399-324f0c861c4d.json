Further, given the situation that the number of footballs is double the number of helmets, we will get the number of footballs by multiplying the total number of helmets by 2.\n4.

So number of footballs = double of 2000 = 4000.\n\nTotal number of items (helmets, robots, and footballs) = 2000 (helmets) + 1000 (robots) + 4000 (footballs) = 7000.\n\nTherefore, Dominick saw 7000 items in total."
