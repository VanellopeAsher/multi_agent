The Problem Solver detailed the reasoning in two simple steps, first calculating the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu, which is a third of the number delivered to Ms. Thompson and then adding the two sums. The Code Executor accurately modeled and executed the problem in python code. The output of the code verifies the arithmetic steps of the Problem Solver."
