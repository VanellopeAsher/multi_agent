Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.\n\nSTEP 3: Calculate the amount of paint used for the other colors\nThe other half of the mural is divided equally among red, white, and purple paints. The total amount of paint used for these three colors is 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints.\n\nSTEP 4: Calculate the amount of red paint used\nSince the amount of red, white, and purple paints is equal, the amount of red paint used is 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints. Therefore, 2 pints of red paint was used for the mural."

The remaining half was equally divided among red, white, and purple, and so each of these colors had an equal third of the remaining paint. In numerical terms, from the total of 12 pints, half (6 pints) was yellow, and the remainder (6 pints) was equally divided among red, white, and purple, yielding 2 pints for each.\n\nTherefore, the solution of 2 pints of red paint is correct and verified."

Thus, how many years it will take to grow 84 centimeters?\nTo solve the problem, we can set up a proportion to find out how many years it will take for the cactus to grow 84 centimeters. Since the cactus grows 12 centimeters in 5 years, we set this as our first ratio. The second ratio will be 84 centimeters to 'x' years. 'x' will represent the number of years we're trying to find. Since the ratios are equal, we can set up the following equation and solve for 'x':\n\n12/5 = 84/x \n\nCross-multiplying and solving for 'x' gives us the answer. "
