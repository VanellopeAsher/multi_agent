As Patty's Plumbing charges for each hour or fraction of an hour, a job that required 2.25 hours of work will be billed for 3 hours (since 2.25 hours rounds up). The cost of labor is $35 per hour, so the total for labor is 3 hours x $35/hour = $105.\n\n2. Add the cost of the service fee and the cost of the parts. The service fee is $40, and the cost of parts is given as $60.\n\n3. The total amount billed by Patty would be the sum of all these costs: $105 for labor, $40 for the service fee, and $60 for parts. Therefore, the total bill is $205."

Since the plumbing company charges in whole hours, the time should be rounded up to the nearest whole hour ('ceil' operation in Python). This calculation will give us the total labor cost.\n2. The parts cost and service fee are given directly in the problem, so we just need to add them to the labor cost to get the total bill.\n\nLet's calculate these in code."

We efficiently solved the problem by first understanding the rules of the fee structure (service fee, hourly labor cost, parts cost, and the detail that fractions of hours are billed as full hours).

The task resulted in an assured total billed amount of $205, which aligns with all our conclusions. Looking forward to tackling the next task together."

So, regardless of the hours spent, $40 will always be charged.\n2. Additionally, it costs $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor. The given time is 2.25 hours, indicating it is more than 2. Therefore, it should be considered as 3 hours because time charged in fractions is equivalent to an hour.\n3. The parts worth are $60.\n   \nSo, to calculate the total bill, we add up all these costs.\n\n1. Service fee = $40\n2. Labor cost = $35 x 3 hours = $105\n3. Cost of parts = $60\n\nTherefore, the total cost will be, Service fee + Labor cost + Cost of parts = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205\n\nPatty's Plumbing will bill a total of $205."
