Her starting salary was $10.50 (Billy's starting rate plus $0.50), and she got a raise of $0.50 after two months, so her hourly rate is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total money each of them will earn when they work 20 hours. Billy will earn 20 * $11.50 = $230 and Sally will earn 20 * $11.00 = $220.\n\nStep 4: Subtract Sally's total money from Billy's to get the difference.
