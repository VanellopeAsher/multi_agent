Calculate the total amount Gerald earned from his work by multiplying his daily salary ($30) by the number of days he worked (7). Let's denote the total amount earned as `total_earned`.\n\n2. Then, calculate the amount Gerald spent by subtracting the amount he saved (`$110`) from the total amount he earned. Let's denote the money spent as `money_spent`.\n\nMathematically: \n\n`money_spent = total_earned - savings`\n\nLet's fill in the above formula with the known values and find out the amount spend."
