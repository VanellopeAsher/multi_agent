In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Step 1: Add up all the cards that Miss Maria has:\n        - She has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards each, total basketball cards = 6*25 = 150\n        - She has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards each, total baseball cards = 5*40 = 200\n        - And she has a collection of 30 rare soccer cards. Therefore, total soccer cards = 30\n        - So, the total number of cards = basketball cards + baseball cards + soccer cards = 150 + 200 + 30 = 380\n\nStep 2: Subtract the cards she kept to get the number of cards that she gave to her students:\n        - Cards she kept = 50\n        - So, the number of cards she gave to her students = Total cards - Cards she kept = 380 - 50 = 330\n\nStep 3: Since each student gets ten cards, we divide the total number of cards given away by the number of cards each student gets to find out how many students there are:\n        - Number of students = Total cards given to students/Number of cards each student gets = 330/10 = 33\n        \nSo, Miss Maria has 33 students."

      "content": "Let's calculate this in Python:\n\n- First, calculate the total basketball cards by multiplying the number of decks (6) by the number of cards in each (25). \n- Then, calculate the total baseball cards by multiplying the number of boxes (5) by the number of cards in each (40). \n- Then, add these two amounts to the number of soccer cards (30) to get the total number of cards. \n- After that, subtract the number of cards she kept (50) from the total to get the number of cards given to the students. \n- Finally, divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives (10) to get the number of students.\n\n```python\n# calculate total basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n# calculate total baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n# add all \ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards + 30\n# calculate cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - 50\n# calculate number of students\nnum_students = cards_given_to_students // 10\nprint(num_students)\n``` \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

They have correctly calculated the total cards Miss Maria has, the number of cards she gave to her students, and the number of students Miss Maria has based on the ten cards each student receives. The solutions proposed by both the Problem Solver and Code Executor are congruent, so hence, no further evaluation of conflicts or missing solutions is required.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{33}"
