Add those 3 amounts together to determine the total cost of those items.\n\n3. Subtract this total from the total amount paid by Marie to find the total amount spent on pizza.\n\n4. Divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost of a single box of pizza to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. \n\nLet's start with step 1:\n\n- The cost of one chicken meal is $12.\n- The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3.5 = $17.5.\n- The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.5 = $6.\n\nIn step 2, add those amounts together:\n\n- $12 (chicken) + $17.5 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $35.5\n\nIn step 3, subtract this total from the total amount paid by Marie:\n\n- $52.5 (total paid) - $35.5 (total cost excluding pizza) = $17\n\nFinally, in step 4, divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost of a single pizza box:\n\n- $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes\n\nSo, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."

To do this, we subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk packs and apples from the total amount Marie has spent.\n\n```python\n# total amount Marie spent \ntotal_spent = 52.5 \n\n# amount Marie spent on pizza \namount_pizza = total_spent - total_cost \n```\nFinally, to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, divide the amount Marie spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza.\n\n```python\n# cost per box of pizza\ncost_per_pizza = 8.50 \n\n# number of boxes of pizza ordered\nboxes_pizza = amount_pizza / cost_per_pizza \nprint(boxes_pizza)\n```\nLet's calculate."
