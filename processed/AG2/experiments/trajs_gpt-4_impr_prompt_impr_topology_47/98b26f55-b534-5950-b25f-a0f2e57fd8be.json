We know Jordan plays video games for 3 hours a day and there are 7 days in a week. So first, calculate the total time spent on video games in a week by multiplying the number of hours he plays each day by 7. \n\n2. Next, we calculate the amount of money he will earn by multiplying the total hours he will work in a week by the hourly rate."

The total earning if he spent this time working instead would be 21 hours/week * $10/hour = $210\n\nTherefore, Jordan would earn $210 in a week if he switched his gaming time to working. \n\nThis calculation is based on a simple assumption - that he would have both the capacity and opportunity to work as much at his part-time job.\nCould you please calculate this using Python, Agent Code Executor?"

      "content": "By examining the solutions proposed by Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor, it is clear that they both arrived at the same conclusion. Both of them calculated the total number of hours Jordan plays video games in a week (21 hours). They then determined the amount of money he would earn if he spent that time working at his job where he makes $10 an hour. Their calculations resulted in Jordan potentially making $210 in a week if he spent his gaming time working. \n\nThe solution process did not have any issues related to missing or assumed values. Jordan's gaming hours and hourly wage were explicitly provided information. Therefore, the proposed solution,\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{210}** is indeed valid. This indicates that Jordan would earn $210 if he spent his gaming hours working instead."
