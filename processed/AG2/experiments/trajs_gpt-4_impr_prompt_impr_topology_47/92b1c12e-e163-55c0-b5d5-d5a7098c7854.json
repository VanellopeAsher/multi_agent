Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter: C = 2D - 5\n2. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son: D = 3S + 4\n\nWe are also given Carver's age (C = 45).\n\nNow, we can solve these equations step-by-step:\n\n1. Solve the first equation for D: D = (C + 5) / 2\n2. Substitute this into the second equation to find S: S = (D - 4) / 3\n\nFinally, substitute the values of C and D obtained from equation 1 into equation 2 to find the value of S."
