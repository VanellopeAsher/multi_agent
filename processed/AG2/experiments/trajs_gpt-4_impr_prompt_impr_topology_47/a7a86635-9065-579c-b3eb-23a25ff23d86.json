The number of boys is hence half the total children (100 boys).\n3. Each boy brought back 600 shells; therefore, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 100 boys times 600 shells, which equals 60000 shells.\n4. We know the girls brought what the boys brought plus four times this amount. So, the girls brought 60000 + 4*(60000) shells.\n5. Since the number of girls is equal to the number of boys (100 girls), to find out how many shells each girl brought, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls.\n\nLet's now calculate the final result."

Since the total number of kids is 200 and they were divided into two equal groups, each group will contain 200/2 = 100 kids.\n\n2. Define the number of shells collected by each boy. The problem states each boy collected 600 shells.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of shells collected by boys (total_boys_shells). This will be the number of boys times the shells per boy.\n\n4. Calculate the total number of shells collected by girls (total_girls_shells). The problem states that this is the total number of shells collected by boys plus four times as many shells as the boys.\n\n5. Calculate the number of shells collected by each girl. This is the total number of shells collected by girls divided by the number of girls.\n\nLet's put this into code."
