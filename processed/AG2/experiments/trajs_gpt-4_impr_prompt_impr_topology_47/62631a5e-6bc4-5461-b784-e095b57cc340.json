      "content": "Here is a solution to this problem:\n\nSTEP 1: Determine the total number of corn chips that two people got. We know from the problem that Amora and Lainey each got 700 corn chips. Therefore, these two received a total of 700 * 2 = 1400 corn chips.\n\nSTEP 2: Find out Collins' total chips. To do this we add the 150 extra chips to what the others got. That means Collins got 700 + 150 = 850 chips.\n\nSTEP 3: Finally, calculate the total number of corn chips. This would be the sum of the corn chips Collins got and the total from Amora and Lainey. That means there were 1400 (from Amora and Lainey) + 850 (from Collins) = 2250 corn chips altogether."
