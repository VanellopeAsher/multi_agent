Calculate how much money Mark needs to earn to buy the bike.\n   To do this, subtract the amount in Mark's bank account from the cost of the bike.\n\n2. Figure out how many days Mark needs to work to earn this money.\n   To do this, divide the total sum by the amount Mark earns per day.\n\n3. If you get a fraction of a day (for example, 10.5 days), round this up to the next whole number of days (11 days) since Mark cannot work a fraction of a day.\n\nLet's execute these steps."
