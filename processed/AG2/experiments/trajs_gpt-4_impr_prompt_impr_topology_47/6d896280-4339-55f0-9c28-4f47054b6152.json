      "content": "To solve this problem, let's assign a variable to the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday, say \"x\". Given that the same amount of chimichangas is made on these two days, it will mean we have \"2x\" chimichangas total for Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the problem, the burrito shop makes twice the amount on Friday compared to a single day (Tuesday or Wednesday), which is \"2x\", making the total amount for all three days \"2x (for Tuesday and Wed) + 2x (for Friday)\" chimichangas.\n\nWe know, from the problem, this total amount is 500.\n\nSo the equation we get is:\n\n2x + 2x = 500\n\nWe can solve this equation for x to find the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday (since it's the same as Wednesday).\n\nx represents the number of chimichangas made on one day (Tuesday or Wednesday), so once we solve for x, we have our answer."

Agent Problem Solver correctly derived the equation for the number of chimichangas made each day given the constraints of the problem. She defined 'x' as the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday or Wednesday and determined the total number made as '4x'. From the given information, '4x = 500', which Agent Problem Solver then solved to find the value of 'x'.\n\nAgent Code Executor executed the code correctly and her output matches the numerical solution from Agent Problem Solver. Both have determined that 'x' - the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday (or Wednesday), given they make the same amount on these days - is 125.\n\nTherefore, the final solution, based on the conclusions reached by both agents, is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{125}** chimichangas made on Tuesday."
