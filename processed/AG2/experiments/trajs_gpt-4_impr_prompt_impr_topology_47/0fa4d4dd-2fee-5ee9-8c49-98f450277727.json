      "content": "Here is my step-by-step solution for this problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes: \n   The jacket cost $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. She wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, so the total cost of the shoes will be 2 * $100 = $200. Hence, the total cost of jacket and shoes will be $120 + $200 = $320.\n\n2. Calculate the total what Sara earns from babysitting: \n   Sara babysits 10 times and each time she earns $5, so the total amount she earns from babysitting is 10 * $5 = $50.\n\n3. Now, we need to find out how much more Sara needs to earn to afford the jacket and shoes: \n   From her savings and babysitting, she has $100 (savings) + $50 (babysitting) = $150. She needs $320 in total, so she still needs to earn $320 - $150 = $170.\n\n4. Figure out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn this amount: \n   Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $10. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs to earn ($170) by the amount she earns each time she mows the lawn ($10). This will be $170 / $10 = 17.\n\nSo, Sara must mow the lawn 17 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.\n"

Calculate how much Sara has earned from babysitting.\n5. Calculate how much Sara has available in total, including she earned from babysitting and her savings.\n6. Subtract the amount Sara has from the total amount she needs - this gives us how much more she needs.\n7. Divide the amount Sara still needs by how much she earns from mowing the lawn to find out how many times she has to mow the lawn.\n\n```python\n# defining the cost of the items Sara wants to buy\ncost_of_jacket = 120\ncost_of_shoes = 100\n\n# multiply the cost of shoes by 2\ntotal_cost_of_shoes = 2 * cost_of_shoes\n\n# add the cost of jacket and shoes\ntotal_cost = cost_of_jacket + total_cost_of_shoes\n\n# calculate the total babysitting earnings\nbabysitting_earnings = 10 * 5\n\n# calculate the total amount Sara has\nmoney_sara_has = 100 + babysitting_earnings\n\n# calculate how much more money Sara needs\nmoney_needed  = total_cost - money_sara_has\n\n# calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn\ntimes_to_mow = money_needed // 10\ntimes_to_mow\n```\nI'll execute the above code now."

We know the cost of the jacket ($120), the cost of each pair of shoes ($100), and the number of pairs of shoes Sara wants to buy (2). So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes will be: cost_of_jacket + (cost_of_each_pair_of_shoes*number_of_pairs_of_shoes).\n\n2. We also know that Sara has $100 saved already, and she earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids. She babysits 10 times, so her total earnings from babysitting will be: babysitting_pay*babysits_times. Her total money after babysitting and savings would be: money_saved + total_earnings_from_babysitting.\n\n3. The amount she still needs to earn to afford the jacket and shoes will be: total_cost_of_jacket_and_shoes - total_money_after_babysitting_and_savings.\n\n4. Finally, we know that she makes $10 each time she mows the lawn. So, the number of times she must mow the lawn will be: extra_money_needed/mowing_pay_for_each_time.\n\nNow, we can write a Python code to implement these steps and calculate the answer.\n\n```python\ncost_of_jacket = 120\ncost_of_each_pair_of_shoes = 100\nnumber_of_pairs_of_shoes = 2\n\ntotal_cost_of_jacket_and_shoes = cost_of_jacket + (cost_of_each_pair_of_shoes*number_of_pairs_of_shoes)\n\nmoney_saved = 100\nbabysitting_pay = 5\nbabysitting_times = 10\n\ntotal_earnings_from_babysitting = babysitting_pay*babysitting_times\ntotal_money_after_babysitting_and_savings = money_saved + total_earnings_from_babysitting\n\nextra_money_needed = total_cost_of_jacket_and_shoes - total_money_after_babysitting_and_savings\n\nmowing_pay_for_each_time = 10\nnumber_of_lawns_to_mow = extra_money_needed/mowing_pay_for_each_time\n\nnumber_of_lawns_to_mow\n```\nLet's follow these steps and execute the Python code to get the final result."
