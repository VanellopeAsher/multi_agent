      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Evaluate the number of hours Bruce worked on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n2. Sum up these hours to find the total number of hours worked over the three days.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n- On Tuesday, we already know that Bruce has worked for 5 hours.\n- On Wednesday, Bruce works double the duration of Tuesday's hours. Therefore, his Wednesday's work hours is 5 (from Tuesday) * 2 = 10 hours.\n- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday. Therefore, his Thursday work hours is 10 (from Wednesday) - 2 = 8 hours.\n  \nFinally, summing up the hours worked for the three days:\n   Total work hours = Tuesday hours + Wednesday hours + Thursday hours\n                                      = 5                  + 10                 + 8\n                                      = 23 hours. \n\nSo, Bruce has worked a total of 23 hours over these three days."

Assign the number of hours Bruce worked on Tuesday to a variable, `tuesday_hours`.\n2. Calculate the number of hours Bruce worked on Wednesday (which is double Tuesday's hours) and assign it to a variable, `wednesday_hours`.\n3. Calculate the number of hours Bruce worked on Thursday (which is 2 less than Wednesday's hours) and assign it to a variable, `thursday_hours`.\n4. Add `tuesday_hours`, `wednesday_hours`, and `thursday_hours` to get the total number of hours Bruce worked over these three days.\n\nHere is the Python code for that:"
