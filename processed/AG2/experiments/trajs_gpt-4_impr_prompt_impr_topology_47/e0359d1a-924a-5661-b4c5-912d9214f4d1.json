Add Robert, Cindy, and Aaron's candy to get the total amount of candy. This equals 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds.\n2. Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people. This equals 12 pounds / 3 people = 4 pounds per person.\n\nSo each of them will have 4 pounds of candy."

      "content": "The solution from both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor align. They both stated that each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing them equally. \n\nAgent Problem Solver used a step-by-step arithmetic calculation method: Adding the total pounds(3+5+4kg) to get 12 pounds then dividing by the number of individuals - which is 3 - to get 4kg per person. \n\nAgent Code Executor also used a Python script to perform the same calculations: Declaring the amount of candy each individual had as variables, then adding to get total candy. Then calculating each person's share by dividing the total candy by the number of people, producing the same result. \n\nBoth solutions are mathematically accurate and produced the same result.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 4.0."
