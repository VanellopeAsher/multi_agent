In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the total cost of Karate classes by $10 per class to find the maximum number of Karate classes Manny's parents are willing to pay for. \n2. Subtract the total number of Karate classes from the number found in the previous step to find how many classes Manny can miss. \n\nLet's perform these calculations. \n\n1. $60 / $10 = 6 classes\n2. 10 classes - 6 classes = 4 classes\n\nSo, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes. After that, the cost per class that Manny attends will exceed $10, and his parents won't sign him up for further classes. The painting class doesn't factor into this decision."

Divide the total cost of Karate classes by the maximum cost per class to find the number of classes Manny's parents are willing to pay for.\n2. Subtract this number from the total number of Karate classes to find the number of classes Manny can miss.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n```python\n# total cost of Karate classes\ntotal_cost = 60\n\n# cost per class\ncost_per_class = 10\n\n# total number of Karate classes\ntotal_classes = 10\n\n# number of classes Manny's parents are willing to pay for\naffordable_classes = total_cost // cost_per_class\n\n# number of classes Manny can miss\nmissed_classes = total_classes - affordable_classes\n\nprint(missed_classes)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to verify the solution."
