      "content": "Here's how the problem can be solved with a bit of basic algebra:\n\n1. We'll denote the number of cherries each person has by the first letter of their name, so R is Richard, J is Jerry, and Rob is Robert.\n\n2. From the problem, we know three things:\n     - Rob = 3000\n     - Rob = R + 1000\n     - R + J + Rob = 6000  \n\n3. From these equations, we can first figure out the number of cherries Richard has by using the second equation. Rearranging, we find R = Rob - 1000. Since we know Rob = 3000, we substitute this into the equation and what we get is R = 3000 - 1000 = 2000.\n\n4. Then, to find the number of cherries Jerry has, we substitute the values of R and Rob into the third equation. So, we get 2000 + J + 3000 = 6000. Solving this equation for J gives J = 6000 - 2000 - 3000 = 1000.\n\n5. Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has, which gives us 3000 - 1000 = 2000. \n\nSo, Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry."
