According to the problem, there are 2.8 times of ten days in February, which means there are 2.8 * 10 = 28 days.\n\nGiven that the first website publishes 20 articles daily, the total number of articles it published in February would be 20 * 28 = 560 articles.\n\nSimilarly, the second website, which publishes 10 articles daily, published 10 * 28 = 280 articles in February.\n\nBy adding up the articles from both websites, we'll get the total number of articles published by both sites, which is 560 + 280 = 840 articles."

Sets the number of days in February, the number of articles published daily by the news website, and the number of articles published daily by its sister company as variables.\n2. Calculates the total number of articles published by each website during February.\n3. Finds the total number of articles published by both websites by summing up their individual totals.\n4. Prints the result. \n\nBy putting the steps discussed by Agent_Problem_Solver into code:\n\n\n\n```python\n# Define the variables\ndays_in_february = 2.8 * 10\nnews_website_articles_per_day = 20\nsister_website_articles_per_day = 10\n\n# Calculate the total number of articles published by the news website\nnews_website_total_articles = days_in_february * news_website_articles_per_day\n\n# Calculate the total number of articles published by the sister website\nsister_website_total_articles = days_in_february * sister_website_articles_per_day\n\n# Find the total number of articles by both websites\ntotal_articles = news_website_total_articles + sister_website_total_articles\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_articles)\n```\n\nExecuting the above python code will give us the total number of articles published by both the websites."

The calculation involved determining the total number of days in February (2.8 times 10), then multiplying the number of days by the average daily political and weather articles (20) and the daily business articles (10) respectively. The results were then added together to get the total articles(840) published in February by the two companies."

The output, 840, is the correct total number of articles published by the two websites in February. The approach involved basic arithmetic operations, such as multiplication for finding the total articles published by each website and addition for found totals. As such, I can confirm that the definitive answer to this problem is 840 articles."
