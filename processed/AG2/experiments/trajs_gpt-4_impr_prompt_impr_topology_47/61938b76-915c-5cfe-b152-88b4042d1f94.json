Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

So, total biscuits = 10 packages * 6 biscuits/package = 60 biscuits.\n\n2. Find the total cost of the biscuits: \n   Each biscuit is priced at $0.10. So, total cost = 60 biscuits * $0.10/biscuit = $6.00\n\n3. Find the change Carl will get back: \n   Carl hands over a $10 note. So, change = $10 - $6 = $4.00\n\nSo, Carl will get $4 change back."
