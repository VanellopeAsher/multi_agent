This gives us the number of rows for red tulips (36 / 6 = 6).\n\n2. Divide the number of blue tulips (24) by the number of blue tulips that can fit in a row (8). This gives us the number of rows for blue tulips (24 / 8 = 3).\n\n3. Divide the number of yellow tulips (30) by the number of yellow tulips that can fit in a row (5). This gives us the number of rows for yellow tulips (30 / 5 = 6).\n\n4. Since we know we will be planting a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips, we will have 6 rows of red tulips, 3 rows of blue tulips, and 9 rows of yellow tulips (6 rows between red and blue tulips, and 3 extra rows).\n\n5. Adding all these rows together gives us the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant (6 + 3 + 9 = 18). \n\nSo, Jackson will plant a total of 18 rows of flowers in his garden."
