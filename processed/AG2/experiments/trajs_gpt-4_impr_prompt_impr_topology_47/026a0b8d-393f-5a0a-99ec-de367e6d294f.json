      "content": "Here's my approach to solving this problem:\n\nStep 1: We know that Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds and each packet costs $30, so we derive the total cost of the celery seeds.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the total cost of celery seeds (obtained in step 1) from the total amount Mrs. Rylan spent ($3200) to get the amount she uses to buy the tomato seeds.\n\nStep 3: We then divide the amount Mrs. Rylan spent on tomato seeds by the cost of one packet of tomato seeds ($40) to get the number of packet of tomato seeds she bought. \n\nLet's execute these steps: \n\nStep 1: Cost of celery seeds = Number of celery seeds packets * Cost of one packet of celery seeds = 80 * $30= $2400\n\nStep 2: Amount spent on tomato seeds = Total amount spent - Cost of celery seeds = $3200 - $2400 = $800\n\nStep 3: Number of tomato seeds packets = Amount spent on tomato seeds / Cost of one tomato seed packet = $800 / $40 = 20 packets.\n\nSo, Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.\n"
