These will decrease his total money.\n4. **Calculating the final amount**: To find out how much money Raymond has left, we should add his initial amount and additional savings, then subtract the cost of the comic book and the puzzle. The mathematical representation will be:\n\n   `(Initial amount + additional savings) - (Comic book + Puzzle)`\n\nNow we can substitute the actual numbers into the equation:\n\n   `($2100 + $1100) - ($500 + $1900)`"
