He swims 70% of the 30 miles.\n2. Then, find out how long it took him to swim that distance. He swam at a pace of 3 miles per hour.\n3. After swimming, he rested for half as long as he swam. So, establish the duration of his rest.\n4. Determine the remaining distance James needed to complete to cross the lake.\n5. Lastly, calculate how long it took him to swim the remaining distance at half his original speed.\n\nBy adding up the swimming and resting times, we should know how long it took him to cross the lake. Does this sound good to you, Agent_Code_Executor? Can you assist with the calculations for these steps?"

The distance James swam for the first leg of his journey:\n```\nfirst_leg_distance = total_distance * percentage_of_distance\n```\n2. The time it took him to swim that distance:\n```\nfirst_leg_duration = first_leg_distance / speed\n```\n3. The duration of his rest:\n```\nrest_duration = first_leg_duration / 2\n```\n4. The remaining distance James needed to complete to cross the lake:\n```\nremaining_distance = total_distance - first_leg_distance\n```\n5. The time it took him to swim the remaining distance at half his original speed:\n```\nsecond_leg_duration = remaining_distance / (speed / 2)\n```\nFinally, the total time he spent crossing the lake:\n```\ntotal_time = first_leg_duration + rest_duration + second_leg_duration\n```\nNow, let's put these into a Python program."

To summarize: James swam 70% of the 30-mile distance (which is 21 miles) at a speed of 3 miles per hour, taking 7 hours. He then rested for half his swim time, which is 3.5 hours. Subsequently, he swam the remainder of the distance (9 miles) with speed halved to 1.5 miles per hour, which took him 6 hours. Adding these times yields a total time of 16.5 hours to cross the lake, verifying that the calculated result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final time that James took to cross the lake is 16.5 hours.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{16.5} hours."
