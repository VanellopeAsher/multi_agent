Finally, we'll subtract the dinner cost from the remaining money to find out how much Ali is left with.\n\n```python\n# Calculate total money initially\ntotal_money = 4 * 10 + 6 * 20\n\n# Calculate money given to sister\nmoney_given_to_sister = total_money / 2\n\n# Calculate remaining money after giving to sister\nremaining_money = total_money - money_given_to_sister\n\n# Calculate money spent on dinner\nmoney_spent_on_dinner = 3/5 * remaining_money\n\n# Calculate money left after buying dinner\nfinal_money = remaining_money - money_spent_on_dinner\n\nfinal_money\n``` \n\nLet's run this code to get the final answer.
