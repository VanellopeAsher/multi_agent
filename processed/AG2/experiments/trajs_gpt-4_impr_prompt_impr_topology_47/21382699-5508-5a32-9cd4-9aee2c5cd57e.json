Therefore: \n\n7x + 11x = 162\n\nBy solving this equation, we can determine the value of x, which can then be used to determine the actual ages of Darrell and Allen. \n\nStep 3: Determine Allen's Age 10 Years From Now\n\nOnce we know Allen's current age, we can calculate his age 10 years from now by adding 10 to his current age. \n\nLet's try to find how old Allen will be 10 years from now!"
