We know that she has 6 presents for family members, 4 for friends, and 2 for teachers. So, sum these up: 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 presents in total.\n\n2. Monica has 144 inches of ribbon for all the presents. To find out how much ribbon can be allocated for each present, divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of presents. That is, 144 inches / 12 presents = what we're looking for.\n\nLet's carry out the arithmetic operations now."
