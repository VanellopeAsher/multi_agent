His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

Calculate the perimeter of the 3 sides of the fence (2 short sides and 1 long side):\n    - 2*length of short side of fence + length of the long side = total length needed.\n\n2. This total length is the amount of crepe paper he needs to buy.\n\nLet's use this formula to solve the problem."

The solution is based on the premise that James needs paper for three sides of the fence which is 2*short side of fence + long side. This fully aligns with conditions given in the problem statement. \n\nAgent Code Executor managed to successfully implement this logic in Python. The given code has computed the total length as 50 feet. \n\nI concur with both agent proposals based on the problem variables provided. James therefore needs to buy 50 feet of crepe paper for his fence.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{50}** feet."
