This can be denoted as (3*x + 0.12).\n\nStep 4: We know the total number of cards between Becca, Smendrick, and PJ is 3.41 hundred. So we can set up an equation what sums the cards each of them has:\n\nx + 3x + (3x + 0.12) = 3.41 \n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of 'x', which is the amount of cards PJ has.\n\nStep 5: To find out how many cards Becca has, we will substitute 'x' with its value in (3*x + 0.12) which is the expression that give us the 100s of cards Becca has. \n\nStep 6: We can then multiply the value we get by 100 since the quantities we have been dealing with are in hundreds.\n\nThis will give us the actual number of cards Becca has."
