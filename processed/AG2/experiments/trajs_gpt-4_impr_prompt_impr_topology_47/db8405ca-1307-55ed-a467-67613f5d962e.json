We need to calculate the total cost for each type of good and then add these costs together to find the total amount Ali has to pay John.\n\nHere are the steps for calculating the total cost:\n\n  1. Calculate the cost of the wooden tables by multiplying the number of tables (40) by the cost of each table ($200). Let's call this Total Tables Cost.\n  2. Calculate the cost of the roof frames by multiplying the number of frames (20) by the cost of each frame ($100). Let's call this Total Frame Cost.\n  3. Add Total Tables Cost and Total Frame Cost together to find the total what Ali has to pay John. \n\nNow let's do the actual calculations."
