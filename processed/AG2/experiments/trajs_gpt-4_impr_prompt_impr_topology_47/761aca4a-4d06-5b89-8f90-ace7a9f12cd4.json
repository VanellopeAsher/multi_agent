So, on Tuesday, the water depth was 17 feet (Monday's depth) + 7 feet = 24 feet.\n \nStep 3: On Wednesday, the water level decreased to two thirds of Tuesday's depth. Thus, the water depth on Wednesday was (2/3)*24 = 16 feet.\n \nSo, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet."

Calculated the depth on Tuesday by adding the initial depth on Monday (17 feet) to the additional rise (7 feet), giving a total of 24 feet.\n2. Calculated the depth on Wednesday as two-thirds of Tuesday's depth - that is, (2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet.\n\nThis is consistent with the result obtained from the Python code executed by Agent Code Executor, which also yielded a depth of 16 feet on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, looking over Agent Verifier's report again, my understanding is that the question doesn't actually specify whether the 7 feet increase occurred on Monday or Tuesday. But as the solutions match, I suppose we have deciphered the question's implied meaning correctly. I look forward to future collaborations."
