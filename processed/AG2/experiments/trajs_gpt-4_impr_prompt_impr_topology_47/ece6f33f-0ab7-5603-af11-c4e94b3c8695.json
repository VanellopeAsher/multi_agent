      "content": "Here's how the problem can be solved with a simple calculation:\n\n1. We need to find out what each person's monthly contribution is first. Since the total monthly cost for electricity is $100 and it's shared by 5 people (including Jenna), we divide $100 by 5. \n\n2. The result of this division is each person's contribution per month.\n\n3. To find the annual contribution, multiply the monthly figure by 12, because there are 12 months in a year.\n\nLet's carry out these steps to find the solution."
