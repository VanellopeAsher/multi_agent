      "content": "First, we need to find out how many smores are needed in total. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of smores desired by the children: Each child wants 2 smores, so for 9 children we have 9 * 2 = 18 smores.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of smores desired by the adults: Each adult wants 1 smore, so for 6 adults we have 6 * 1 = 6 smores.\n\nStep 3: Add up the numbers of smores needed by the children and adults to get the total number of smores. \n\nStep 4: Determine how many smores can be made from a single box of graham crackers. Each box contains 3 packets and each packet can make 8 big smores. Therefore, one box makes 3 * 8 = 24 smores.\n\nStep 5: Divide the total number of smores needed by the number of smores per box. \n\nStep 6: If the result from step 5 is not a whole number, round up to ensure there is enough for everyone, as we can't purchase a fraction of a box. \n\nStep 7: The result will tell us the number of boxes we need to purchase. \n\nLet's proceed with these steps."

      "content": "Alright, let's translate that into Python code.\n\nFor Step 1 and Step 2, calculate the number of Smores desired by children and adults respectively. Add these two to get the total required Smores.\n\nFor Step 3, calculate the number of Smores a packet of graham crackers can make. Thus, find out how many Smores a box can make since it contains 3 packets.\n\nFor Step 4, divide the total required Smores by the number of Smores a box can make. If the division results in a decimal, round up to the nearest whole number as we can't purchase a fraction of a box.\n\nFinally, print the result. \n\nLet's implement this."
