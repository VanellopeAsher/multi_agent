Considering that 1 hour is 60 minutes, we can convert 6 hours a day to 360 minutes and 2 additional hours to 120 minutes.\n\nSecondly, we need to determine how many calls Tim can handle in a day by dividing his total work time in minutes (360 minutes) by the time it takes him to handle a call (15 minutes). This will give us the total number of calls he deals with from Monday to Thursday.\n\nOn Fridays, his worktime increases to 360 minutes + an extra 120 minutes. We repeat the same process of dividing the total Friday work time by the time it takes to process a call to get the number of calls Tim handles on Friday.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of calls Tim handles in a week by adding the number of calls handled from Monday to Thursday and the number on Friday. \n\nThis three-step process should provide the answer to the question."
