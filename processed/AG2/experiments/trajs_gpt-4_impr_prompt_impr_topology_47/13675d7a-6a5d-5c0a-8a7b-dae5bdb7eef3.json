      "content": "Let's solve this problem in a step by step manner:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of wheels used for assembling the cars: Each car uses 4 wheels, and 57 cars are assembled. Therefore, the total number of wheels is 4 * 57 = 228 wheels.\n2. Calculate the total number of wheels used for assembling motorcycles: Each motorcycle uses 2 wheels, and 73 motorcycles are assembled. Therefore, the total number of wheels is 2 * 73 = 146 wheels.\n3. Sum up the total number of wheels used for cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels are used.\n4. The problem states that after assembling the toys, 276 wheels are left in the box. Therefore, to find the initial number of wheels in the box before assembling started, add the numbers of wheels used and wheels left: 374 wheels (used) + 276 wheels (left) = 650 wheels.\n\nThus, initially, there were 650 wheels in the box."
