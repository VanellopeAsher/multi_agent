So, the cost for each bottle of scotch is 600/10 = $60\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the number and cost of the cognac bottles.\n    \n    John bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so thatâ€™s 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n    And each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than each bottle of scotch. So, the cost for each bottle of cognac is 60 + (60 * 0.5) = $90\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the total cost of the cognac bottles.\n    \n    The total cost that John spent on cognac is 20 * 90 = $1800\n\nStep 4: Find out the total cost of everything.\n    \n    This is the sum of the cost of all the scotch and cognac bottles. So, the total cost is 600 + 1800 = $2400.\n\n  Hence, John spent $2400 on everything."

Determine the cost of each bottle of scotch: Divide the total cost of scotch by the number of bottles.\n2. Use the results from step 1 to find the cost of each bottle of cognac: Add 50% to the cost of each bottle of scotch.\n3. Find the total cost of the cognac: Multiply the cost of each bottle of cognac by the number of cognac bottles (which is twice the number of scotch bottles).\n4. Find the total cost of everything: Add the total cost of scotch and the total cost of cognac.\n\nWe'll translate this into Python code."
