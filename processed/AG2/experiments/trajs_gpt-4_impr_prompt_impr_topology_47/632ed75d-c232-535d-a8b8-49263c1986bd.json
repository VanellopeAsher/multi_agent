The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

      "content": "Yes, I can solve this problem. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Let's denote the number of total flights by the first aircraft as `F1`.\n2. According to the problem, the second aircraft makes 44 flights, which is said to be half the total flights of the first aircraft. So we can form the equation: 0.5*`F1` = 44. From this equation, we can derive `F1` = 44 * 2 = 88.\n3. Then what remains after the flights to Greece by aircraft 1 is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of `F1` which is to be divided evenly between France and Germany. This means France gets half of these flights.\n4. Therefore, the number of flights by the first aircraft to France is: `F1` * 1/4 * 0.5 = 88 * 1/4 * 0.5.\n\nLet me finish the calculations."

The first step involves calculating the number of total flights made by the first aircraft, F1, which is twice the number of flights made by the second aircraft, giving us 2*44 = 88 flights. The number of flights made to France by the first aircraft equals quarter of its total flights, divided by two, which gives us 88 * 1/4 * 1/2 = 11 flights. \n\nEvaluating these solutions, it appears that both agents have correctly followed the steps and arrived at the same conclusion. Therefore, I agree with their solutions. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{11}."
