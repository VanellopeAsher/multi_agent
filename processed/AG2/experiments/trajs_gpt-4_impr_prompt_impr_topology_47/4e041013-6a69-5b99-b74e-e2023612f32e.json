Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

So with 24 blue tulips, he will need 24/8 = 3 rows for the blue tulips.\n\nTo find the total number of rows Jackson will end up planting, we just have to add together the number of rows needed for the red and blue tulips. That is, 6 rows (for red) + 3 rows (for blue) = 9 rows.\n\nTherefore, Jackson will end up planting 9 rows of tulips in his garden."
