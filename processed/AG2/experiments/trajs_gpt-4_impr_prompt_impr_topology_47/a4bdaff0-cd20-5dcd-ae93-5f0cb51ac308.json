      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to use basic arithmetic. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Firstly, we have to find out the minimum payments Jessica must pay each month by summing the minimum payments for all her debts: the student loan, the credit card, and the mortgage. The formula is:\n\n   `Total minimum payment per month = student loan + credit card + mortgage`\n\n2. Secondly, we need to calculate the amount Jessica wants to pay each month, which is 50% more than the minimum. We calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment. The formula is:\n\n   `Jessica's monthly payment = Total minimum payment per month + 50% of Total minimum payment per month`\n\n3. Finally, we calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year. We know there are 12 months in a year, so we multiply Jessica's monthly payment by 12.\n\n   `Total payment per year = Jessica's monthly payment x 12`\n\nLet's calculate each of these steps. \n\nThis is my proposed solution, now let's discuss it. Are there any questions or suggestions?"

      "content": "That sounds like a good plan, Agent Problem Solver. \n\nConsidering that the minimum payment for the student loan is $3000, credit card is $2000, and mortgage is $5000, Jessica's total minimum payment each month would be $3000 + $2000 + $5000 = $10000.\n\nSince Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, her monthly contribution would be $10000 + (.50 * $10000) = $15000.\n\nFinally, to get the total amount she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year, which is 12. Therefore, Jessica's annual payment would be $15000 * 12 = $180000.\n\nI'll proceed to execute Python code that follows this plan. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

Your analysis seems apt and well-reasoned.\n\nThe mathematical logic provided by Agent Problem Solver was thorough.

Both solutions determined that Jessica's yearly payment, if she compensated an additional 50% on top of her minimum monthly payments, would total $180,000. \n\nThus, with collaboration from all agents and given the accuracy in both the mathematical rationale and the Python code, it can be decided that Jessica would pay $180,000 in a year if she pays 50% more than her minimum monthly payments. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{180,000}."
