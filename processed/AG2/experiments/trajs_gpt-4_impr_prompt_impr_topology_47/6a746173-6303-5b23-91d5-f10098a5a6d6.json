This includes the $300 from the neighbors, $1200 from the online fund, and $120 from Walter's friend.\n\n2. Multiply the total sum by three as the lawyer's pledge is three times what everyone else donated. \n\nThis solution assumes that the phrase 'everyone else' is inclusive of donations received up to the point the lawyer made his pledge. \n\nTherefore, this what the lawyer would need to donate."
