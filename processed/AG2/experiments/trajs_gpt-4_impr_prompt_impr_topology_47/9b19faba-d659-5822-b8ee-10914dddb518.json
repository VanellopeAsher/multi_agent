      "content": "Sure, let's break this problem down:\n\n1. First, we need to understand how many boxes Sunny sold each day.\n    - On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and (unknown number - 4) boxes of apple pie.\n    - On Sunday, he sold (10+5) boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.\n    - On Monday, he sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie.\n\n2. To find how many apple pies he sold on Saturday, we need to know that it is four less than he sold on Sunday, which is 15. So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.\n\n3. Now, let's find out the total number of boxes sold for each product over the three days:\n    - Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) + 2 (Monday) = 27 boxes.\n    - Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) + 4 (Monday) = 30 boxes.\n\n4. Given the prices of gingerbread and apple pie, we can now calculate how much Sunny earned in total:\n    - Total earnings from gingerbread = 27 boxes * $6 = $162\n    - Total earnings from apple pie = 30 boxes * $15 = $450\n\n5. Finally, to find out how much Sunny earned for three days, we add the earnings from both products: $162 (from gingerbread) + $450 (from apple pie) = $612. \n\nSo, Sunny earned $612 for three days."
