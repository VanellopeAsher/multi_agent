      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first understand the total costs and profits for the trader:\n\n1. We know that the cost of each bag of wheat is $20, and it also costs $2 to transport each bag, summing up to a total cost of $22 per bag.\n\n2. The trader sells each bag for $30, which means that the revenue for each bag is $30.\n\n3. So, for each bag he sells, the trader's profit is the sale price ($30) minus the purchase and transportation cost ($22), which is $8 per bag.\n\n4. Since we know the total profit the trader made was $400, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag. This gives us $400 / $8 = 50 bags. \n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. \n\nNow let's discuss and see if everyone agrees with this. \n\nAlso, note that the weight of the bag wasn't useful for solving this problem but might have been included just as an additional detail."

Start by defining the purchase cost, transportation cost, and sale price per bag.\n2. Calculate the profit per bag. This will be equal to the sale price minus the sum of the purchase cost and transportation cost.\n3. Divide the total profit by the profit per bag to get the total number of bags sold. \n\nLet's put this into Python code."

His revenue per bag sold is $30. Thus, his profit per bag is $30 - $22 = $8. We know the trader's total profit was $400. Hence he sold $400 / $8 = 50 bags of wheat.\n\nThis matches with both solutions proposed by Agent_Code_Executor and Agent_Problem_Solver. \n\nTherefore, the final solution is: The trader sold 50 bags of wheat.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{50}."
