      "content": "Here's how the problem can be solved with a simple calculation:\n\n1. We need to find out how long does it take for John to solve the extreme sudoku puzzle.\n     As we know an extreme sudoku puzzle takes 3 times longer than a normal puzzle, and he can solve a normal puzzle in 30 minutes. So, the time taken by John to solve the extreme sudoku puzzle is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.\n\n2. Now, we need to calculate how many bottles of water does John consume during this period.\n     As we know John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (or 30 minutes). Given that it takes John 90 minutes, he would consume 90 / 30 = 3 bottles of water.\n\nSo, John drinks 3 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle."

John takes 90 minutes to finish an extreme Sudoku puzzle, and since he consumes one bottle of water every 30 minutes, he would consume 3 bottles of water during this time.
