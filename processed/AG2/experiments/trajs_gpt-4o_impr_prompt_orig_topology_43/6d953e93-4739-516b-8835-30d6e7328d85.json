Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use algebra to model and find the number of car tires repaired on Friday. Here is the strategy to tackle the problem:\n\n### Key Idea\n1. **Determine the earnings on Thursday:** \n   - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires (*$60 each*) and 4 car tires (*$40 each*).\n   - Calculate the total earnings for Thursday.\n\n2. **Formulate an equation for Friday's earnings:**\n   - Let the number of car tires repaired on Friday be \\( x \\).\n   - The mechanic earns only from car tire repairs on Friday at a rate of $40 per tire.\n\n3. **Relate Thursday's and Friday's earnings:**\n   - According to the problem, the earnings on Thursday exceed those on Friday by $40.\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\).**\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Define the variables\nx = symbols('x')  # number of car tires repaired on Friday\n\n# Step 2: Calculate earnings on Thursday\nthursday_earnings = 6 * 60 + 4 * 40\n\n# Step 3: Earnings on Friday based on x car tires\nfriday_earnings = 40 * x\n\n# Step 4: Setup the equation that Thursday earnings are $40 more than Friday earnings\nequation = Eq(thursday_earnings, friday_earnings + 40)\n\n# Step 5: Solve for x\nnumber_of_car_tires_friday = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the number of car tires repaired on Friday\nprint(number_of_car_tires_friday[0])\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will compute the number of car tires repaired on Friday based on the conditions provided. Let's solve and confirm this carefully.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate Thursday earnings:**\n   - \\( \\text{Thursday earnings} = 6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40 = 360 + 160 = 520 \\).\n\n2. **Formulate the Friday earnings equation based on unknown \\( x \\):**\n   - Represent Friday earnings: \\( 40x \\).\n  \n3. **Set up the relational equation:**\n   - \\( 520 = 40x + 40 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Rearrange: \\( 520 - 40 = 40x \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( 480 = 40x \\).\n   - Divide: \\( x = \\frac{480}{40} = 12 \\).\n\nThus, the number of car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday is \\( \\boxed{12} \\)."
