      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $300 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1200 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $120 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?"

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Contributions from Others:**\n   - Walter collects \\$300 from his neighbors.\n   - Additionally, he collects \\$1200 from his online fund.\n   - His friend contributes \\$120.\n\n2. **Total Contribution Calculation:**\n   - Total amount from neighbors and the online fund: \\(300 + 1200 = 1500\\).\n   - Adding his friend's contribution: \\(1500 + 120 = 1620\\).\n\n3. **Lawyer's Contribution:**\n   - Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates (excluding his own contribution).\n   - Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be \\(3 \\times 1620 = 4860\\).\n\nLet's use the specified format to write this in Python and verify the computations.\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate total contributions from others\nneighbors_contribution = 300\nonline_fund_contribution = 1200\nfriends_contribution = 120\n\ntotal_contributions_except_lawyer = neighbors_contribution + online_fund_contribution + friends_contribution\n\n# Lawyer's contribution calculation\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * total_contributions_except_lawyer\n\n# Output the lawyer's contribution\nprint(lawyer_contribution)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- Neighbors' contribution: \\$300, check.\n- Online fund: \\$1200, check.\n- Friend's contribution: \\$120, check.\n- Total contribution from others (excluding the lawyer): \\(300 + 1200 + 120 = 1620\\), check.\n- Lawyer donates three times this total: \\(3 \\times 1620 = 4860\\), check.\n\nThe lawyer will contribute á¨ƒoxed{4860}."
