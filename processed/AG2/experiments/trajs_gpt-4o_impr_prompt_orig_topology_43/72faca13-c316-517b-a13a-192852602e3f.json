Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents, how many cents will she have left?"

We can then subtract her expenditures from her initial amount to find the remainder.\n\nGiven:\n- Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.\n\nTo solve this:\n- Calculate the total amount Kelly has using the given coins.\n- Subtract the cost of the can of pop and candy bar from her total amount.\n\nLet's proceed with a step-by-step process using Python for calculation:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has initially\n- Each quarter is worth 25 cents.\n- Each dime is worth 10 cents.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total from quarters} = 5 \\times 25 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total from dimes} = 2 \\times 10 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial total amount} = \\text{Total from quarters} + \\text{Total from dimes} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total expenditure\n- Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents.\n- She buys a candy bar for 45 cents.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total expenditure} = 55 + 45 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Subtract the total expenditure from the initial total amount\n\\[ \\text{Remaining amount} = \\text{Initial total amount} - \\text{Total expenditure} \\]\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculating the initial total amount\nquarters = 5\ndimes = 2\ntotal_quarters = quarters * 25\ntotal_dimes = dimes * 10\ninitial_total_amount = total_quarters + total_dimes\n\n# Calculating the total expenditure\ncost_pop = 55\ncost_candy_bar = 45\ntotal_expenditure = cost_pop + cost_candy_bar\n\n# Calculating the remaining amount\nremaining_amount = initial_total_amount - total_expenditure\n\n# Print the result\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this to find the remaining amount of cents Kelly will have."

Let's go through the steps again to confirm the result.\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Initial Total Calculation:**\n   - Total from quarters: \\(5 \\times 25 = 125\\) cents\n   - Total from dimes: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) cents\n   - Initial total amount: \\(125 + 20 = 145\\) cents\n\n2. **Total Expenditure Calculation:**\n   - Cost of the can of pop: 55 cents\n   - Cost of the candy bar: 45 cents\n   - Total expenditure: \\(55 + 45 = 100\\) cents\n\n3. **Remaining Amount Calculation:**\n   - Remaining amount: \\(145 - 100 = 45\\) cents\n\nThus, Kelly will have 45 cents left after her purchases.\n\n\\(\\boxed{45}\\)"
