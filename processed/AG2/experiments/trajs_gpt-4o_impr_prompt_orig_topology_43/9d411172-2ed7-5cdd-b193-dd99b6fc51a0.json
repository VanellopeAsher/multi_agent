Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $20 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 12 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we follow a step-by-step process using basic arithmetic. The goal is to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per attended class exceeds $20.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Allowed Cost per Class:**\n   - The maximum cost per class that is acceptable is $20.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost for Karate Classes:**\n   - Manny's classes cost him a total of $80 for all classes.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Classes:**\n   - The total number of classes Manny signed up for is 12.\n\n4. **Calculate the Condition for Maximum Cost:**\n   - Let's calculate the number of classes he has to attend such that the cost per class remains less than or equal to $20.\n\n5. **Set Up the Inequality:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of classes Manny attends.\n   - The cost per class is \\(\\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20\\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Solving the inequality \\(\\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20\\), we multiply both sides by \\( x \\) to get \\( 80 \\leq 20x \\).\n   - Divide both sides by 20 to isolate \\( x \\): \\( 4 \\leq x \\).\n\n### Calculation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\nx = symbols('x')\n# Equation representing the cost constraint\neq = Eq(80/x, 20)\n\n# Solve for x\nminimum_classes_attended = solve(eq, x)[0]\n\n# Total classes - minimum attended = maximum he can miss\nmax_misses = 12 - minimum_classes_attended\n\n# Print the result\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(f'Manny can miss {Rational(max_misses)} classes.')\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo ensure that the per class cost does not exceed $20, Manny needs to attend at least 4 classes. Therefore, since there are 12 total classes, Manny can miss at most \\( 12 - 4 = 8 \\) classes.\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Inequality Check:** Ensuring \\(\\frac{80}{4} = 20\\), confirms that attending 4 classes is the minimum requirement.\n2. **Calculation Arguments:** Recalculating points verify the allowable miss count without error.\n\nThus, the number of classes Manny can miss is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."

      "content": "Let's reiterate the solution succinctly:\n\nThe task is to determine how many classes Manny can miss while keeping the cost per class at or below $20. Here's a brief recap and calculation breakdown:\n\n### Key Information:\n- Total cost for classes: $80\n- Total number of classes: 12\n- Maximum acceptable cost per class: $20\n\n### Inequality Setup:\nTo calculate the number of classes Manny must attend so that the cost per class is $20 or less, we set up the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of classes Manny attends.\n\n### Solve the Inequality:\n1. Multiply both sides by \\( x \\): \n\n   \\[\n   80 \\leq 20x\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[\n   4 \\leq x\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nManny needs to attend at least 4 classes. Given there are 12 total classes, we calculate the maximum number of classes he can miss:\n\n\\[\n12 - 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of classes Manny can miss while keeping the per-class cost under $20 is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
