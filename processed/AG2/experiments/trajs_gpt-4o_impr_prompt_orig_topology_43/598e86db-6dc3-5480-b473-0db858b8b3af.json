Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people Billy helps per hour based on the total number of people he helps during the given time frame.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe will first calculate the total number of days Billy is available to help people, excluding the days he takes off. Then, we'll use the total number of people he helped to find out how many people he helps per hour.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Days:**\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - From March 1st to April 19th, the period includes March and 19 days of April. So, total days = 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n   \n2. **Calculate Days Off:**\n   - Billy takes 20% of these days off. \n   - Number of days off = 0.20 × 50 = 10 days.\n\n3. **Calculate Days Worked:**\n   - Total days worked = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Hours Worked:**\n   - Billy works 3 hours per day.\n   - Total hours worked = 40 days × 3 hours/day = 120 hours.\n\n5. **Determine People Helped Per Hour:**\n   - Billy helps a total of 240 people.\n   - People helped per hour = Total people / Total hours worked = 240 / 120.\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python\n\n# Given data\ntotal_days_in_period = 31 + 19  # March + March 1st to April 19th\ndays_off_percentage = 0.20\ntotal_people_helped = 240\nhours_per_day = 3\n\n# Calculate total days\ndays_off = days_off_percentage * total_days_in_period\ndays_worked = total_days_in_period - days_off\n\n# Calculate total hours worked\ntotal_hours_worked = days_worked * hours_per_day\n\n# Calculate people helped per hour\npeople_per_hour = total_people_helped / total_hours_worked\n\n# Output the result\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(total_people_helped, total_hours_worked))\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. Total days calculation: 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.\n2. Days off calculation: 20% of 50 = 10 days, leaving 40 working days.\n3. Total working hours: 40 days × 3 hours = 120 hours.\n4. People per hour calculation: 240 people / 120 hours = 2 people per hour.\n\nUpon verifying each step, the calculations align correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, the number of people Billy helps per hour, is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
