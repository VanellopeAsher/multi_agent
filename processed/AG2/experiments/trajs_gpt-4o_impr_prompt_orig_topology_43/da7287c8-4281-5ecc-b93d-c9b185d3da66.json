Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTerry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, nine burger platters for $11.5 each, and half of 40 sodas for $1.50 each. How much money does he make in total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total revenue from each item Terry sells and then sum them up to find the total. This is a simple arithmetic problem, so we'll follow Case 1: Direct Python Solution.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n1. Calculate the total revenue from milkshakes.\n2. Calculate the total revenue from burger platters.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from sodas.\n4. Sum all revenues to find the total money Terry makes.\n\nWe'll use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the revenue from milkshakes\nmilkshake_price = Rational(550, 100)  # $5.50 each\nmilkshake_count = 6\nmilkshake_revenue = milkshake_price * milkshake_count\n\n# Calculate the revenue from burger platters\nburger_price = Rational(1150, 100)  # $11.50 each\nburger_count = 9\nburger_revenue = burger_price * burger_count\n\n# Calculate the revenue from sodas\nsoda_price = Rational(150, 100)  # $1.50 each\nsoda_count = 40 / 2  # Half of 40 sodas\nsoda_revenue = soda_price * soda_count\n\n# Total revenue\ntotal_revenue = milkshake_revenue + burger_revenue + soda_revenue\n\n# Print the total revenue\nprint(total_revenue)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Milkshake Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milkshake Revenue} = 6 \\times 5.50 = 33\n   \\]\n\n2. **Burger Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Burger Revenue} = 9 \\times 11.50 = 103.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Soda Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Soda Revenue} = (40 / 2) \\times 1.50 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Revenue Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = 33 + 103.5 + 30 = 166.5\n   \\]\n\nI have verified the correctness of each component, so we can confidently assert the final result:\n\n\\( \\boxed{166.5} \\)"
