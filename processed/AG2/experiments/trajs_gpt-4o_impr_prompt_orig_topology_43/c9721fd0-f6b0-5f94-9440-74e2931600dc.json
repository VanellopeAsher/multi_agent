Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the total cost of the plumbing service for a particular job by considering the service fee, the cost of labor based on the hours worked, and the cost of parts.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach: Case 1 (Direct Python Solution)\nThe total cost can be calculated by adding:\n1. The fixed service fee\n2. The labor cost, which is the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly labor rate (*rounding up to the nearest whole hour*)\n3. The cost of parts\n\nWe can easily write a Python script to compute this total.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nservice_fee = 40\nhourly_labor_cost = 35\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# Hours worked\nhours_worked = 2.25\n\n# Calculate total cost\n# Labor is charged per hour or fraction thereof, so round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours\nlabor_cost = math.ceil(hours_worked) * hourly_labor_cost\ntotal_cost = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `math.ceil(hours_worked)`: We use the `ceil` function from the `math` library to round up 2.25 hours to the nearest whole hour, which is 3 hours.\n- The labor cost is then calculated by multiplying the rounded hours by the hourly rate: \\(3 \\times 35 = 105\\).\n- The total cost is the sum of the service fee, labor cost, and parts cost: \\(40 + 105 + 60\\).\n\nOutput:\nWhen you run this code, you will get the total amount billed by Patty.\n\nLet's verify this solution step by step:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Service Fee**: $40\n2. **Hours Worked**: 2.25 hours, rounded up to the next whole number is 3 hours.\n3. **Labor Cost Calculation**:\n   - \\( \\text{Hourly Labor Rate} = \\$35 \\)\n   - \\( \\text{Labor Cost} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$35/\\text{hour} = \\$105 \\)\n4. **Parts Cost**: $60\n5. **Total Cost Calculation**:\n   - \\( \\text{Total Cost} = \\$40 + \\$105 + \\$60 = \\$205 \\)\n\nThus, the total amount billed by Patty is \\$205. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{205} \\]"
