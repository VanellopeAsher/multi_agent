Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a direct proportion based on the relationship given between potatoes and hash browns.\n\nGiven:\n- 60 potatoes produce 360 hash browns.\n\nWe need to find out how many hash browns (let's call this \\( x \\)) can be made with 960 potatoes.\n\n### Key Concept:\nThe problem involves a direct proportion: \n\\[ \n\\text{If 60 potatoes} \\rightarrow \\text{360 hash browns} \n\\]\nThe ratio of potatoes to hash browns should be the same regardless of the total number of potatoes.\n\n### Approach:\n1. Set up the proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60 \\text{ potatoes}}{360 \\text{ hash browns}} = \\frac{960 \\text{ potatoes}}{x \\text{ hash browns}}\n   \\]\n2. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\nHere is the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the unknown variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Create the equation based on the proportion\nequation = Eq((60 / 360), (960 / x))\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the solution in a clear format\nprint(solution)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION SECTION\nLet's verify this calculation step-by-step:\n- Calculate the number of hash browns per potato from the initial data:\n  \\[ \n  \\frac{360}{60} = 6 \\text{ hash browns per potato}\n  \\]\n- Now, calculate the total number of hash browns that 960 potatoes would produce:\n  \\[ \n  960 \\times 6 = \\text{5760 hash browns}\n  \\]\n\nThe verification confirms that our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, using 960 potatoes, you can make \\(\\boxed{5760}\\) hash browns."

Let's ensure we are printing the whole results without unnecessary decimals:\n\nTo confirm once more, 960 potatoes indeed make 5760 hash browns, as derived from the calculations:\n\nUsing 60 potatoes, you get 360 hash browns, which simplifies to \\(6\\) hash browns per potato. Therefore, for 960 potatoes, the total is:\n\n\\[ \n960 \\times 6 = 5760 \\text{ hash browns} \n\\]\n\nNow, here's the clean result without unnecessary decimal points:\n\n\\(\\boxed{5760}\\) hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes."
