Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let’s start by understanding the distribution of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister.\n\n### Key Idea\nJoanne gathers apples from three types of trees:\n1. **Tallest trees**: 30 apples.\n2. **Shortest trees**: Half of what she gathers from the tallest trees, which is \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\) apples.\n3. **Average trees**: 350 apples.\n\nHer sister gathers:\n1. **Tallest trees**: Twice as many as Joanne, so \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\) apples.\n2. **Shortest trees**: Let this amount be \\( x \\) apples.\n3. **Average trees**: 0 apples.\n\nThe total number of apples they gather is given as 500.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. **Calculate total apples gathered by Joanne**:\n   - Tallest trees: 30 apples\n   - Shortest trees: 15 apples\n   - Average trees: 350 apples\n   - Total by Joanne: \\( 30 + 15 + 350 = 395 \\) apples\n\n2. **Calculate total apples gathered by the sister**:\n   - Tallest trees: 60 apples\n   - Shortest trees: \\( x \\) apples\n   - Total by sister: \\( 60 + x \\) apples\n\n3. **Combine their totals**:\n   - Total apples gathered: \\( 395 + 60 + x = 500 \\)\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - From the equation: \\( 395 + 60 + x = 500 \\)\n   - \\( x = 500 - 395 - 60 \\)\n   - \\( x = 45 \\)\n\n5. **Determine the ratio of apples gathered from the shortest trees**:\n   - Joanne's apples from shortest trees: 15\n   - Sister's apples from shortest trees: 45\n   - Ratio: \\( \\frac{45}{15} = 3 \\)\n\nJoanne's sister gathered apples from the shortest trees three times more than Joanne.\n\n### Verification\n1. Verification of Joanne's total: \\( 30 + 15 + 350 = 395 \\). Correct.\n2. Verification of the sister’s apples from tallest trees: \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\). Correct.\n3. Verification of combined total: \\( 395 + 60 + 45 = 500 \\). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution satisfies all the conditions provided in the problem.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
