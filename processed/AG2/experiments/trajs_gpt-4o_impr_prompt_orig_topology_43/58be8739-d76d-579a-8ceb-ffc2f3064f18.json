Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to follow a step-by-step process to determine how much time John spent in various activities and, ultimately, how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the total time John spent on various activities:**\n   - **Boating:** 6 hours\n   - **Swimming:** Half of boating time, so \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3 \\) hours\n   - **Watching shows:** 3 shows, each 2 hours, so \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\n2. **Total time spent on activities:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total activity time} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total vacation time calculation:**\n   - According to the statement, this 15 hours is 30% of his total time.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total vacation time. Then:\n     \\[\n     0.3x = 15\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{15}{0.3} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the sightseeing time:**\n   - Total time: 50 hours\n   - Time not spent sightseeing (activities): 15 hours\n   - Sightseeing time: \\( 50 - 15 = 35 \\) hours\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Check each step for correctness:\n  - Activity time calculations are consistent with problem data.\n  - The equation for total time correctly represents 30% as 15 hours.\n  - Calculation for total vacation time from 30% is correct.\n  - Subtraction results in the correct sightseeing time.\n\nThe calculations appear accurate, and thus John spent:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]\n\nhours sightseeing."
