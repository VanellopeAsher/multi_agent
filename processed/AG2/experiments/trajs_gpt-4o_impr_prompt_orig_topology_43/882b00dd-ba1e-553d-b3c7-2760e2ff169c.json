Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "Let's approach this problem step by step by analyzing the salary changes for both Billy and Sally and then calculating the total earnings for both over 20 hours.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n**Billy's Earnings Calculation:**\n1. **Initial Rate:** $10 per hour.\n2. **First Raise:** After 2 months, gets a raise of $0.50 per hour.\n   - New Rate after 2 months: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n3. **Second Raise:** On his first anniversary, gets an additional raise of $1.00 per hour.\n   - New Rate after 1 year: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.\n\n**Sally's Earnings Calculation:**\n1. **Initial Rate:** $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n2. **First Raise:** After 2 months, gets a raise of $0.50 per hour.\n   - New Rate after 2 months: $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.\n\n**Work Hours:** Both work the same amount of time, which is 20 hours.\n\n### Earnings Calculation\n\n- **Billy's Total Earnings:** His latest rate, after one year, is $11.50 per hour.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Billy's total earnings} = 11.50 \\times 20\n  \\]\n\n- **Sally's Total Earnings:** Her rate after 2 months is $11.00 per hour.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sally's total earnings} = 11.00 \\times 20\n  \\]\n\n### Calculating the Difference\n\nTo find how much more Billy earns than Sally:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in earnings} = \\text{Billy's total earnings} - \\text{Sally's total earnings}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python:\n\n```python\n# Python code\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the hourly rates\nbilly_hourly_rate_after_1_year = Rational(1150, 100)  # $11.50 per hour\nsally_hourly_rate_after_2_months = Rational(1100, 100)  # $11.00 per hour\n\n# Define the number of work hours\nwork_hours = 20\n\n# Calculate total earnings for both\nbilly_total_earnings = billy_hourly_rate_after_1_year * work_hours\nsally_total_earnings = sally_hourly_rate_after_2_months * work_hours\n\n# Calculate the difference in earnings\ndifference_in_earnings = billy_total_earnings - sally_total_earnings\n\n# Print the difference\nprint(difference_in_earnings)\n```\n\n### Verification\n1. **Billy's hourly rate:** After all raises over the first year, he earns $11.50 per hour.\n2. **Sally's hourly rate:** After the initial two-month raise, she earns $11.00 per hour.\n3. **Total earnings for 20 hours:**\n   - Billy: \\( 11.50 \\times 20 = 230 \\) dollars\n   - Sally: \\( 11.00 \\times 20 = 220 \\) dollars\n4. **Difference:** \\[ 230 - 220 = 10 \\]\n\nThe calculations are verified step-by-step, ensuring correctness.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\(\\boxed{10}\\)"
