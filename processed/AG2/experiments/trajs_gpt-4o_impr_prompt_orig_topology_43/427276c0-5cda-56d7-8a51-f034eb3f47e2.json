Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?"

      "content": "To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height contributed by all the women and then divide by the total number of women wearing heels. This is a simple average calculation.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Count of Women and Heel Heights**:\n   - Three women are wearing 4.5-inch heels.\n   - Three women are wearing 2.5-inch heels.\n\n2. **Total Height Calculation**:\n   - Height contributed by women wearing 4.5-inch heels: \\(3 \\times 4.5\\).\n   - Height contributed by women wearing 2.5-inch heels: \\(3 \\times 2.5\\).\n\n3. **Total Number of Women**: \\(3 + 3 = 6\\).\n\n4. **Average Height**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average height} = \\frac{\\text{Total height}}{\\text{Total number of women}}\n   \\]\n\nLet's proceed with the code to perform these calculations using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Heights and their respective counts\nheels_4_5 = 4.5\ncount_4_5 = 3\n\nheels_2_5 = 2.5\ncount_2_5 = 3\n\n# Total height contribution from each group\ntotal_height_4_5 = heels_4_5 * count_4_5\ntotal_height_2_5 = heels_2_5 * count_2_5\n\n# Total height from all women\ntotal_height = total_height_4_5 + total_height_2_5\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = count_4_5 + count_2_5\n\n# Average height calculation using Rational for fraction representation\naverage_height = Rational(total_height, total_women)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the average height of the heels expressed as a fraction.\n\nLet's now verify the solution.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate the total height for each group:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5 \\quad \\text{inches (for 4.5-inch heels)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\quad \\text{inches (for 2.5-inch heels)}\n   \\]\n\n2. Sum of all heights:\n   \\[\n   13.5 + 7.5 = 21 \\quad \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. Total number of women:\n   \\[\n   6 \\quad \\text{(three from each group)}\n   \\]\n\n4. Average height of the heels:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5 \\quad \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\nThe result of \\( \\frac{21}{6} \\) confirms that our answer is correct.\n\n\\(\\boxed{3.5}\\) is the average height of the heels at the party."
