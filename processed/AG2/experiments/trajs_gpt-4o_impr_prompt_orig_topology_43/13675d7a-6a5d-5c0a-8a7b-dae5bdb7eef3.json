Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Henry knows that to assemble all the toys he will need 4 wheels for each car and 2 wheels for each motorcycle. There are 276 wheels left in a box after Henry assembles all toys.

      "content": "To determine how many wheels are initially in the box, let's use algebra to set up the problem.\n\n**Key Concept:**\nEach car requires 4 wheels, and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. We are given the number of cars and motorcycles Henry has and how many wheels are left after assembling all the toys. By calculating the total number of wheels used, we can find out how many were originally in the box by adding the remaining wheels.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Calculate the total number of wheels required for all cars and motorcycles.\n2. Sum the wheels used with the remaining wheels to find the total wheels initially in the box.\n\nLet's use Python to compute this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Known quantities\ncars = 57\nmotorcycles = 73\nwheels_per_car = 4\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\nwheels_left_after_assembly = 276\n\n# Calculate wheels needed for the toys\nwheels_for_cars = cars * wheels_per_car\nwheels_for_motorcycles = motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle\n\n# Total wheels used\ntotal_wheels_used = wheels_for_cars + wheels_for_motorcycles\n\n# Let x be the initial number of wheels in the box\nx = symbols('x')\nequation = x - total_wheels_used - wheels_left_after_assembly\n\n# Solve the equation\ninitial_wheels = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(initial_wheels)\n```\n\n**Explanation of Code:**\n- We calculate the total wheels needed using the number of cars and motorcycles.\n- We formulate an equation to solve for the initial total wheels: \\(x\\) (initial wheels) = total wheels used + wheels left after assembly.\n- We solve for \\(x\\) using SymPy and print the result.\n\nBy executing the code, we can calculate the initial number of wheels in the box. Once the calculation is verified, the answer will be presented using the required format."
