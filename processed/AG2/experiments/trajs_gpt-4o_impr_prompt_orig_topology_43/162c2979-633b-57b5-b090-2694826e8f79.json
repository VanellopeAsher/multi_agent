Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the gum packs that Suzie bought. We will follow a straightforward approach to break down the costs of each type of gum based on the information provided.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Identify the cost of each type of gum pack:\n   - Strawberry: Suzie bought 2 packs, each costing $2.\n   - Grape: Suzie bought 1 pack costing $2.\n   - Green Apple: The price is half of the grape gum pack, which is $1 because half of $2 is $1.\n2. Calculate the total cost by adding the costs of all these packs.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the cost of each type of gum\nstrawberry_gum_cost = 2 * 2  # 2 packs of strawberry gum, each costing $2\ngrape_gum_cost = 2  # 1 pack of grape gum costing $2\ngreen_apple_gum_cost = 2 / 2  # Green apple gum costing half of grape gum\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = strawberry_gum_cost + grape_gum_cost + green_apple_gum_cost\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. Calculate the cost of the strawberry gum: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) dollars.\n2. Calculate the cost of the grape gum: \\(2\\) dollars.\n3. Calculate the cost of the green apple gum: \\(2 / 2 = 1\\) dollar.\n4. Sum all the costs: \\(4 + 2 + 1 = 7\\) dollars.\n\nThe calculations are correct, and the total cost matches our computations. Therefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."
