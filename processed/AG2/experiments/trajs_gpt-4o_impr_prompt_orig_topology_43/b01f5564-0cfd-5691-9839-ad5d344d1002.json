Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how much protein John gets from eating 300 grams of mushrooms daily and then calculate the total protein intake over a week (7 days). Here's the structured approach:\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Determine Protein Content per Gram:**\n   - We know that 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein.\n   - Calculate how many grams of protein are in 1 gram of mushrooms.\n\n2. **Calculate Daily Protein Intake:**\n   - Use the protein content per gram to find out how much protein is in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n\n3. **Calculate Weekly Protein Intake:**\n   - Multiply John's daily protein intake by 7 to find his weekly protein intake.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\nweight_per_cup = 150  # grams\nprotein_per_cup = 4  # grams\n\n# Protein content per gram of mushrooms\nprotein_per_gram = Rational(protein_per_cup, weight_per_cup)\n\n# Daily intake\ndaily_intake = 300  # grams\n\n# Calculate daily protein intake\ndaily_protein_intake = daily_intake * protein_per_gram\n\n# Calculate weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein_intake = daily_protein_intake * 7\n\n# Print the weekly protein intake\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate the protein content per gram: \\(\\frac{4}{150}\\).\n2. For 300 grams: \\(300 \\times \\frac{4}{150} = 8\\) grams of protein per day.\n3. For one week: \\(8 \\times 7 = 56\\) grams of protein.\n\nThe computations confirm our results at each step. Therefore, John's weekly protein intake is 56 grams.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{56}\n\\]"
