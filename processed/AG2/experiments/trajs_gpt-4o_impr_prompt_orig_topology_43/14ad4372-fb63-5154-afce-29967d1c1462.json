Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday.

Therefore, in 5 days, she teaches \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) classes.\n- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.\n- On Sunday, she does not teach any classes.\n\n**Total classes in a week =** \\(25 \\text{ classes (Monday to Friday)} + 8 \\text{ classes (Saturday)} = 33 \\text{ classes}\\).\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.\n- Each class has 15 students.\n\n**Total students in a week =** \\(33 \\text{ classes} \\times 15 \\text{ students/class} = 495 \\text{ students}\\).\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate her total earnings in a week.\n- She charges $15.00 per student for each class.\n\n**Total earnings in a week =** \\(495 \\text{ students} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\nLet's write the code to verify these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate Judy's earnings\n\n# Import needed library\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Given values\nclasses_per_day_weekdays = 5\nclasses_saturday = 8\nstudents_per_class = 15\ncharge_per_student = 15\n\n# Calculate total classes in a week\ntotal_classes = (classes_per_day_weekdays * 5) + classes_saturday\n\n# Calculate total students in a week\ntotal_students = total_classes * students_per_class\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = total_students * charge_per_student\n\n# Print total earnings\nprint(f\"Total earnings in a week: ${total_earnings}\")\n\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Total Classes Calculation:**\n   - Monday to Friday: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n   - Saturday: 8\n   - Total: \\(25 + 8 = 33\\)\n\n2. **Total Students Calculation:**\n   - \\(33 \\times 15 = 495\\)\n\n3. **Total Earnings Calculation:**\n   - \\(495 \\times 15 = 7425\\)\n\nAfter verifying each step, the calculations are correct, and the final result is confirmed.\n\n\\(\\boxed{7425}\\)"

The total earnings can be calculated as follows:\n\n- **Total Classes per Week**: 33\n- **Students per Class**: 15\n- **Charge per Student**: $15\n\nSo, the calculation for total earnings is:\n\\[ 33 \\times 15 \\times 15 = 7425 \\]\n\nYour earlier message confirmed this calculation correctly.
