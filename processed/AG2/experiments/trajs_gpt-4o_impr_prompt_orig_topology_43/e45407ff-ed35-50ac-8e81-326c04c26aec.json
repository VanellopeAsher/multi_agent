Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  The alcohol content of cognac is 15% stronger than scotch.  How much does he spend on everything?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps and use Python to handle the calculations. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Calculate the price per bottle of scotch:**\n   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, the price per bottle of scotch is \\( \\frac{600}{10} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the price per bottle of cognac:**\n   - Cognac costs 50% more per bottle than scotch. So, the price per bottle of cognac is \\( \\text{price per bottle of scotch} \\times 1.5 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of cognac bottles and calculate the total cost:**\n   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch, so he buys \\( 2 \\times 10 \\) bottles of cognac.\n   - The total cost for cognac is the price per bottle of cognac times the number of bottles.\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount spent on both alcohols:**\n   - Add the cost of scotch and the cost of cognac to find the total spending.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\n# Import the Decimal class from the decimal library\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the price per bottle of scotch\ntotal_cost_scotch = Decimal('600')\nnumber_of_scotch_bottles = Decimal('10')\nprice_per_scotch = total_cost_scotch / number_of_scotch_bottles\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the price per bottle of cognac\n# Cognac costs 50% more per bottle than scotch\nprice_per_cognac = price_per_scotch * Decimal('1.5')\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of cognac bottles and the total cost for cognac\nnumber_of_cognac_bottles = number_of_scotch_bottles * Decimal('2')\ntotal_cost_cognac = price_per_cognac * number_of_cognac_bottles\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent on everything\ntotal_spent = total_cost_scotch + total_cost_cognac\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nBy following these steps, we calculate the total amount John spends on both the scotch and cognac. Now, let's run this code to find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Import the Decimal class for precise calculations without floating-point errors\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\n# Total cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600\ntotal_scotch_cost = Decimal('600')\nnumber_of_scotch_bottles = Decimal('10')\n# Price per bottle of scotch\nprice_per_scotch = total_scotch_cost / number_of_scotch_bottles\n\n# Price per bottle of cognac is 50% more than scotch\nprice_per_cognac = price_per_scotch * Decimal('1.5')\n\n# He buys twice as many bottles of cognac\nnumber_of_cognac_bottles = number_of_scotch_bottles * Decimal('2')\n# Total cost of cognac\ntotal_cognac_cost = price_per_cognac * number_of_cognac_bottles\n\n# Total cost of everything\ntotal_cost = total_scotch_cost + total_cognac_cost\n\n# We print the total cost spent on everything\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThe result from the code will give us the total amount spent. Now let's go through the verification steps.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify price per bottle of scotch:**\n   - \\( \\frac{600}{10} = 60 \\). Hence each bottle of scotch costs $60.\n\n2. **Verify price per bottle of cognac:**\n   - Cognac costs 50% more: \\( 60 \\times 1.5 = 90 \\). Hence each bottle of cognac costs $90.\n\n3. **Verify number and cost of cognac bottles:**\n   - He buys \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) bottles of cognac.\n   - Total cost for cognac: \\( 20 \\times 90 = 1800 \\).\n\n4. **Verify total amount spent:**\n   - Scotch: $600, Cognac: $1800.\n   - Total: \\( 600 + 1800 = 2400 \\).\n\nWe verify that our solution for the total spending is accurate.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2400}\n\\]"
