Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is wrapping Christmas gifts. She has 6 gifts to wrap for her family, 4 gifts to wrap for her friends and 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers. She wants to make a bow for each gift. How many inches of ribbon can she use for each gift bow?"

      "content": "To start solving the problem, we need to determine how many gifts Monica has in total, and then decide how much ribbon she has available. However, the problem does not specify the total length of ribbon Monica has. Without this crucial information, we can't calculate how much ribbon she can use for each bow. Therefore, this problem cannot be solved directly without knowing the total length of ribbon available. \n\nThus, due to the missing piece of information regarding the total ribbon length, this math problem falls under the category of missing data. According to our handling protocol for missing data, we'll proceed by recognizing the unsolvable nature of this problem.\n\nThe appropriate conclusion is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)\n\nLet's verify:\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. **Clarification of Given Information:**\n   - Monica has 6 gifts for family, 4 gifts for friends, and 2 gifts for teachers.\n   - Total number of gifts is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.\n\n2. **Missing Information:**\n   - Total amount of ribbon Monica has is not provided.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Unable to determine the length of ribbon per bow without additional data on the total ribbon availability.\n\nThe answer remains: \\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)"
