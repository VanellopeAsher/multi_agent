Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought back from the scavenger hunt.\n\n**Key Concept: Use algebra to find the solution.**\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Divide the Kids:**\n   - There are 200 kids, divided equally into boys and girls.\n   - Number of boys = Number of girls = \\( \\frac{200}{2} = 100 \\).\n\n2. **Seashells Collected by Boys:**\n   - Each boy brought back 600 seashells.\n   - Total shells collected by boys = \\( 100 \\times 600 = 60,000 \\).\n\n3. **Seashells Collected by Girls:**\n   - Girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many.\n   - Total shells collected by girls = \\( 60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate Seashells Brought by Each Girl:**\n   - Each girl collected the same amount.\n   - Number of seashells each girl brought = \\( \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000 \\).\n\nLet's implement this calculation using Python to confirm the solution:\n\n```python\n# Implement the calculations using Python\n\n# Total number of kids\ntotal_kids = 200\n\n# Divide into two groups\ngirls = boys = total_kids // 2\n\n# Seashells brought by each boy\nseashells_per_boy = 600\n\n# Total seashells brought by boys\ntotal_shells_boys = boys * seashells_per_boy\n\n# Seashells brought by girls\ntotal_shells_girls = total_shells_boys + 4 * total_shells_boys\n\n# Seashells brought by each girl\nseashells_per_girl = total_shells_girls / girls\n\n# Print the result\nprint(int(seashells_per_girl))\n```\n\nRunning this code should output `3000`, demonstrating that each girl brought back 3,000 seashells.\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. Total number of seashells brought by boys: \\( 100 \\times 600 = 60,000 \\).\n2. Girls bring an amount equal to the boys plus four times that: \\( 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000 \\).\n3. Divided equally among 100 girls, each brings back: \\( \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000 \\).\n\nAll calculations confirmed, providing the final answer as expected:\n\n\\(\\boxed{3000}\\)"
