Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 0.1 times of one thousand years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 0.1 times of one hundred years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age."

      "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step using the provided instructions.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n1. We need to find the age of Peter.\n2. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is \\(0.1 \\times 1000\\) years.\n3. Paul's age is \\(0.1 \\times 100\\) years older than John's age.\n4. Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n#### Step 1: Define Variables\n- Let \\(J\\) be John's age.\n- Let \\(P\\) be Paul's age.\n- Let \\(T\\) be Peter's age.\n- Let \\(N\\) be Jean's age.\n\n#### Step 2: Express Relations Using Equations\n1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean:\n   \\[\n   T + P + N = 0.1 \\times 1000\n   \\]\n2. Paul's age in terms of John's age:\n   \\[\n   P = J + 0.1 \\times 100\n   \\]\n3. Peter's age as the sum of Paul and John's age:\n   \\[\n   T = P + J\n   \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Solve the Equations\nCombine the above equations to solve for \\(T\\) (Peter's age):\n\nGiven:\n- \\(T + P + N = 100\\)\n- \\(P = J + 10\\)\n- \\(T = P + J\\)\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the third:\n\\[\nT = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(T\\) and \\(P\\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + N = 100\n\\]\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n3J + 20 + N = 100\n\\]\n\nFrom the equation \\(3J + 20 + N = 100\\), we have:\n\\[\n3J + N = 80\n\\]\n\nCurrently, without specific values for one of the variables (e.g., John or Jean), we cannot determine a unique solution. However, another equation can be derived as:\n   - Since \\(T = P + J = J + 10 + J = 2J + 10\\), we can consider this additional equation and try solving for different scenarios, but given the problem structure, without more data, a numerical solution cannot be identified directly.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe age of Peter relies on the explicit values not determined directly from the given information. To proceed, we'd need additional context or constraints about John's or Jean's exact age or relations involving Jean with respect to the others, which, unfortunately, is missing here. Therefore, the problem is unsolvable given the current data:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\]"
