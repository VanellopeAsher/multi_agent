Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6.6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2.5 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time John spent on each of his activities and then find out how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n**Problem-Solving Approach: Step-by-Step Process**\n\n1. **Calculate John's Total Vacation Hours**:\n   - John spent 6.6 hours boating.\n   - He spent half that time swimming: \\( \\text{Swimming time} = \\frac{6.6}{2} \\).\n   - He watched 3 shows, each lasting 2.5 hours: \\( \\text{Show time} = 3 \\times 2.5 \\).\n   - The time spent watching shows was 30% of his total vacation time.\n\n2. **Determine John's Total Vacation Time**:\n   Since the show time is equal to 30% of his total vacation time, we can establish:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\frac{\\text{Show time}}{0.3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sightseeing Time**:\n   John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. So we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sightseeing time} = 0.4 \\times \\text{Total time}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute these values using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the known values\nboating_time = Rational(66, 10)  # 6.6 hours\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshow_per_show = Rational(25, 10)  # 2.5 hours\nshows_time_total = 3 * show_per_show\n\n# Total time from 30% of total\ntotal_time = shows_time_total / Rational(30, 100)\n\n# Calculate sightseeing time as 40% of total\nsightseeing_time = total_time * Rational(40, 100)\n\nprint(\"Sightseeing time:\", sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Check calculations:\n   - Swimming time should be \\( \\frac{6.6}{2} = 3.3 \\) hours.\n   - Total show time calculation: \\( 3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\) hours.\n   - Total vacation time: \\( \\frac{7.5}{0.3} = 25 \\) hours.\n   - Sightseeing time: \\( 0.4 \\times 25 = 10 \\) hours.\n\n2. Check percentage calculations:\n   - The time spent on shows, \\( 7.5 \\) hours, equates to 30% of \\( 25 \\) hours.\n   - Sightseeing takes 40% of total, which matches 10 hours of the 25.\n\nEverything checks out perfectly. Thus, the total time he spent sightseeing is \\( \\boxed{10} \\) hours."
