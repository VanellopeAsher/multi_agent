Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Additionally, Madeline also buys a special shampoo for her dog that costs $15 per month and a toy that costs $10 every two months.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total annual cost of all the expenses related to Madeline's dog. We'll break down the problem into manageable steps:\n\n1. **Understand Weekly and Monthly Costs:**\n    - **Food:** $25 per week\n    - **Treats:** $20 per month\n    - **Medicine:** $100 per month\n    - **Shampoo:** $15 per month\n    - **Toy:** $10 every two months\n\n2. **Calculate Annual Expenses for Each Category:**\n    - **Food:** \n      Since there are 4 weeks per month, the monthly cost for food is \\( 25 \\times 4 \\). Multiply this by 12 to get the yearly cost.\n    - **Treats, Medicine, Shampoo:**\n      Multiply the monthly costs by 12 to get the yearly costs.\n    - **Toy:**\n      Since the toy is purchased every two months, calculate the number of purchases per year and multiply by the cost.\n\n3. **Sum Up All the Annual Costs:**\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python and ensure we print the result.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define costs\nweekly_food_cost = 25\nmonthly_treats_cost = 20\nmonthly_medicine_cost = 100\nmonthly_shampoo_cost = 15\nbi_monthly_toy_cost = 10\n\n# Calculate yearly costs\nyearly_food_cost = weekly_food_cost * 4 * 12  # 4 weeks per month * 12 months\nyearly_treats_cost = monthly_treats_cost * 12\nyearly_medicine_cost = monthly_medicine_cost * 12\nyearly_shampoo_cost = monthly_shampoo_cost * 12\nyearly_toy_cost = bi_monthly_toy_cost * 6  # 6 purchases in a year (every 2 months)\n\n# Sum all yearly costs\ntotal_annual_cost = (yearly_food_cost + yearly_treats_cost + yearly_medicine_cost +\n                     yearly_shampoo_cost + yearly_toy_cost)\n\n# Print the result using Proper format\nprint(Rational(total_annual_cost))\n```\n\nNow, perform the calculations:\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. **Food Calculation:** $25 \\times 4 = \\$100$ per month, $100 \\times 12 = \\$1200$ per year.\n2. **Treat Calculation:** $20 \\times 12 = \\$240$ per year.\n3. **Medicine Calculation:** $100 \\times 12 = \\$1200$ per year.\n4. **Shampoo Calculation:** $15 \\times 12 = \\$180$ per year.\n5. **Toy Calculation:** $10 \\times 6 = \\$60$ per year.\n6. **Total Cost Verification:** $1200 + 240 + 1200 + 180 + 60 = \\$2880$\n\nAfter verifying our calculations, Madeline spends a total of \\(\\boxed{2880}\\) dollars per year on her dog."

Let's go through the calculations one more time systematically to double-check everything, setting up the annual costs for each item:\n\n1. **Calculate the Annual Cost for Each Item:**\n\n    a. **Food:**\n    - Weekly cost: $25\n    - Monthly cost: \\(25 \\times 4 = 100\\) dollars\n    - Annual cost: \\(100 \\times 12 = 1200\\) dollars\n\n    b. **Treats:**\n    - Monthly cost: $20\n    - Annual cost: \\(20 \\times 12 = 240\\) dollars\n\n    c. **Medicine:**\n    - Monthly cost: $100\n    - Annual cost: \\(100 \\times 12 = 1200\\) dollars\n\n    d. **Shampoo:**\n    - Monthly cost: $15\n    - Annual cost: \\(15 \\times 12 = 180\\) dollars\n\n    e. **Toy:**\n    - Bi-monthly cost: $10 (toy is bought every two months)\n    - Annual purchase frequency: 6 times in a year\n    - Annual cost: \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\) dollars\n\n2. **Total Annual Cost:**\n\n   Add up all the annual costs:\n   \\[\n   1200 + 240 + 1200 + 180 + 60 = 2880\n   \\]\n\nAfter verifying each step and calculation, the total annual cost remains consistent.
