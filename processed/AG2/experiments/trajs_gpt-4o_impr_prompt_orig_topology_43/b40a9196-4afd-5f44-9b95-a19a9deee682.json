Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. If a 10% tax is applied to all items that are not food, what is the total cost of all the items?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to separate the food items from the non-food items, compute the taxes applied, and then sum up the costs.\n\n### Key Idea\nIn this problem, the key idea is to categorize the items into \"food\" and \"non-food\" to apply the appropriate tax on non-food items.\n\n- **Food Items**: Milk and eggs.\n- **Non-Food Items**: Light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of food items.\n2. Calculate the cost of non-food items.\n3. Apply the 10% tax on non-food items.\n4. Sum the costs of food items and the taxed non-food items.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python using the `sympy` library to ensure we handle any fractions accurately.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices of items (dollars)\nmilk = 2\neggs = 3\nlight_bulbs = 3\ncups = 3\nroach_traps = 4\n\n# Food items total\nfood_total = milk + eggs\n\n# Non-food items total\nnon_food_total = light_bulbs + cups + roach_traps\n\n# Applying a 10% tax on non-food items\ntax_rate = Rational(10, 100)  # 10%\ntax_on_non_food = non_food_total * tax_rate\n\n# Total cost including tax\ntotal_cost = food_total + non_food_total + tax_on_non_food\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify each step:\n\n1. The total cost of food items: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) dollars.\n2. The total cost of non-food items before tax: \\(3 + 3 + 4 = 10\\) dollars.\n3. Tax on non-food items: \\(10 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 1\\) dollar.\n4. Total cost including tax: \\(5 (food) + 10 (non-food) + 1 (tax) = 16\\) dollars.\n\nAll calculations check out as expected. Therefore, the total cost of all items, including tax, is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{16}\\)"
