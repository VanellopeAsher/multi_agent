Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can safely stand from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the gold javelin.\n\n**Key Concept**: \n- Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 4000 feet.\n- Holding the gemstone triples the distance Polly can throw.\n\n**Calculation**:\n1. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. This is three times the normal distance of 4000 feet.\n2. Determine how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can safely stand by subtracting the dragon's fire range from Polly's extended javelin throw.\n\nLet's calculate these steps using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic math computations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational, solve\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the throw distance with the gemstone\nnormal_distance = 4000  # in feet\ngemstone_multiplier = 3\n\nextended_distance = normal_distance * gemstone_multiplier\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the safe distance outside the dragon's fire range\ndragon_fire_range = 10000  # in feet\n\nsafe_distance = extended_distance - dragon_fire_range\n\n# Output the result using the print function\nprint(f\"The safe distance Polly can stand from the dragon while holding the gemstone is {safe_distance} feet.\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n1. Without the gemstone, Polly can throw 4000 feet.\n2. With the gemstone, she can throw \\(3 \\times 4000 = 12000\\) feet.\n3. Dragon's fire reaches 10000 feet.\n4. Polly can stand \\(12000 - 10000 = 2000\\) feet outside of the dragon's reach.\n\nBy following these calculations and verification steps, we conclude that Polly can stand safely 2000 feet outside the dragon's flame reach while using the enhanced javelin throw distance due to the gemstone.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2000}\n\\]"

However, let me summarize the process and present the final answer clearly:\n\n**Problem Recap:**\n- Polly can throw a javelin up to 4000 feet normally.\n- The sapphire gemstone allows Polly to throw the javelin three times farther.\n- The dragon’s flame can reach up to 10,000 feet.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n1. Calculate the enhanced javelin throw distance with the gemstone:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Extended Throw Distance} = 3 \\times 4000 = 12,000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how much further Polly can stand from the dragon's safety range:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Safe Distance} = 12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- Polly can safely stand 2,000 feet beyond the dragon’s reach while still being able to hit it with the javelin when holding the gemstone.\n\nThus, the safe distance Polly can stand from the dragon is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2000}\n\\]"
