Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how much money Kelly has left in her budget after purchasing the grocery items, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Key Concept\nThe problem involves basic arithmetic operations to calculate the total cost of the items and compare it with Kelly's budget.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of one pack of bacon:**\n   Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total, the cost per pack is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \\frac{10.5}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of one packet of chicken:**\n   Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of chicken:**\n   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of strawberries:**\n   She has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.5.\n\n5. **Calculate the cost of one pack of apples:**\n   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.\n\n6. **Calculate the total cost of apples:**\n   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.\n\n7. **Calculate the total cost of all groceries:**\n   Sum up the total costs of bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples.\n\n8. **Determine how much money is left in her budget:**\n   Subtract the total grocery cost from her budget of $65.\n\nLet's calculate these steps using Python and sympy for precise arithmetic, adhering to the outlined format.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols, solve\n\n# Step 1: Cost per pack of bacon\ntotal_bacon_cost = Rational(105, 10)  # $10.5 in terms of fractional dollar\nbacon_cost_per_pack = total_bacon_cost / 5\n\n# Step 2: Cost per pack of chicken (twice the cost of bacon)\nchicken_cost_per_pack = 2 * bacon_cost_per_pack\n\n# Step 3: Total cost of chicken (6 packs)\ntotal_chicken_cost = 6 * chicken_cost_per_pack\n\n# Step 4: Total cost of strawberries (3 packs at $4.5 each)\nstrawberry_cost_per_pack = Rational(45, 10)\ntotal_strawberry_cost = 3 * strawberry_cost_per_pack\n\n# Step 5: Cost per pack of apples (half the cost of strawberries)\napple_cost_per_pack = strawberry_cost_per_pack / 2\n\n# Step 6: Total cost of apples (7 packs)\ntotal_apple_cost = 7 * apple_cost_per_pack\n\n# Step 7: Total grocery cost\ntotal_cost = total_bacon_cost + total_chicken_cost + total_strawberry_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# Step 8: Money left in budget ($65 budget)\nbudget = 65\nmoney_left = budget - total_cost\n\n# Output the results\nprint(\"Money left in the budget, in dollars:\", money_left)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Bacon Cost Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per bacon pack} = \\frac{10.5}{5} = 2.1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Chicken Cost Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per chicken pack} = 2 \\times 2.1 = 4.2\n   \\]\n   Total for chicken:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 4.2 = 25.2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Strawberry Total Cost:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apple Cost Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per apple pack} = \\frac{4.5}{2} = 2.25\n   \\]\n   Total for apples:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 2.25 = 15.75\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total Grocery Cost:**\n   \\[\n   10.5 + 25.2 + 13.5 + 15.75 = 64.95\n   \\]\n\n6. **Money Left in Budget:**\n   \\[\n   65 - 64.95 = 0.05\n   \\]\n\nThus, Kelly has \\(\\boxed{0.05}\\) dollars left in her budget."
