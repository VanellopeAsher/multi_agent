      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the ages of each sibling in the family.\n2. Calculate the total age by summing the ages of all siblings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the given information.\n  - There are 10 sisters, each 16 years old.\n  - One brother is 12 years old.\n  - The older brother is twice as old as the younger, which means he is \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) years old.\n\n- **Step 2**: Calculate the total age of all the sisters.\n  - Since there are 10 sisters each aged 16, the total age of the sisters is:\n    \\[\n    10 \\times 16 = 160\n    \\]\n\n- **Step 3**: Calculate the total age of both brothers.\n  - Younger brother’s age: 12\n  - Older brother’s age: 24\n  - Total age for the brothers is:\n    \\[\n    12 + 24 = 36\n    \\]\n\n- **Step 4**: Calculate the total age of all siblings.\n  - Sum the total age of the sisters and brothers:\n    \\[\n    160 + 36 = 196\n    \\]\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the ages of siblings\nsisters_count = 10\nsister_age = 16\nyounger_brother_age = 12\nolder_brother_age = 24  # 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Calculate the total age\ntotal_sisters_age = sisters_count * sister_age\ntotal_brothers_age = younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\ntotal_age = total_sisters_age + total_brothers_age\n\n# Print the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- Re-check each step to ensure correctness:\n  - Confirmed that each sister is 16 years old and there are 10 sisters.\n  - Confirmed younger brother is 12 and older brother is 24.\n  - All calculations for ages are verified and accurate.\n\nThus, the total age of all siblings is \\( \\boxed{196} \\)."
