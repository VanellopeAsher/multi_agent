Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces certain inches long. At last she obtains 8 pieces, then how many inches was each piece?"

      "content": "To find out how long each piece of wire is in inches, we need to solve the problem by using the given information about the total length of wire in feet and the number of pieces it was divided into.\n\nKey Idea:\n- Convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches.\n- Divide the total inches by the number of pieces to find the length of each piece.\n\nHere is how we can achieve this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Total length of wire in feet\ntotal_length_feet = 4\n\n# Convert total length to inches (1 foot = 12 inches)\ntotal_length_inches = total_length_feet * 12\n\n# Number of pieces\nnum_pieces = 8\n\n# Length of each piece in inches\nlength_per_piece = total_length_inches / num_pieces\n\nprint(length_per_piece)\n```\n\nIn this code, we:\n1. Convert the total length from feet to inches since there are 12 inches in a foot.\n2. Then we divide the total number of inches by the number of pieces to get the length of each piece.\n\nNow, let's verify the process:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Conversion**: Convert 4 feet to inches. \\(4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches per foot} = 48 \\text{ inches}\\).\n\n2. **Division**: Divide the total length in inches by the number of pieces. \\( \\frac{48 \\text{ inches}}{8 \\text{ pieces}} = 6 \\text{ inches per piece} \\).\n\nUpon verifying these steps, each piece should be 6 inches long.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{6}\\)"
