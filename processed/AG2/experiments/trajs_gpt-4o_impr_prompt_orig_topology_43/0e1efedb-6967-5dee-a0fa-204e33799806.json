Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26. She utilized a discount voucher that reduced her total by $7. What was the total amount of money my mother expended at the gardening store?"

      "content": "To find out the total amount of money your mother expended at the gardening store, we need to calculate the sum of the price of the pots and the garden soil, and then subtract the discount she received.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of the problem:\n1. Determine the total cost of the items before the discount.\n   - Price of pots = $19\n   - Price of garden soil = $26\n2. Apply the discount of $7 to the total cost.\n3. Output the final amount spent after applying the discount.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Add the prices of the items\ntotal_cost_before_discount = 19 + 26\n\n# Subtract the discount\ntotal_cost_after_discount = total_cost_before_discount - 7\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost_after_discount)\n```\n\nExecuting this code, we find:\n\n- The total cost before the discount is \\( 19 + 26 = 45 \\).\n- The total cost after applying the discount is \\( 45 - 7 = 38 \\).\n\nSo, the total amount of money your mother expended at the gardening store is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]"
