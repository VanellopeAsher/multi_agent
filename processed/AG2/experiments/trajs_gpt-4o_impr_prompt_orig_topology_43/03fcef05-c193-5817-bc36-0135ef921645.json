Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRaymond initially had $2100. Then he saved $1100 from his allowance and spent $500 on a comic book and $1900 on a puzzle. How much money does Raymond have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to track Raymond's money through the series of transactions he made.\n\n**Key Idea: Direct Python Solution**\n\nWe can solve this problem directly by using simple arithmetic calculations. Here's the breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Amount:** Raymond starts with $2100.\n2. **Saved Amount:** He saves an additional $1100 from his allowance.\n3. **Spending:** He spends $500 on a comic book and $1900 on a puzzle.\n\nWe can calculate the remaining amount by following these steps:\n\n- Add the saved amount to the initial amount.\n- Subtract the expenditures from the total amount after saving.\n\nLet's translate this into Python code and solve:\n\n```python\n# Initial amount Raymond had\ninitial_amount = 2100\n\n# Amount saved from allowance\nsaved_amount = 1100\n\n# Amount spent on comic book\nspent_comic_book = 500\n\n# Amount spent on puzzle\nspent_puzzle = 1900\n\n# Calculate the total remaining amount\nremaining_amount = initial_amount + saved_amount - spent_comic_book - spent_puzzle\n\n# Print the result\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify this solution to ensure everything has been calculated correctly.\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. **Initial Amount:** $2100\n2. **Saved Amount:** +$1100\n   - New Total: $2100 + $1100 = $3200\n3. **Spent on Comic Book:** -$500\n   - New Total: $3200 - $500 = $2700\n4. **Spent on Puzzle:** -$1900\n   - Final Amount: $2700 - $1900 = $800\n\nRaymond, after all the transactions, has $800 left.\n\nTherefore, the final amount of money Raymond has left is \\(\\boxed{800}\\)."
