      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips and decides to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips. If he can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row and he buys 30 yellow tulips, how many total rows of flowers will he plant?"

      "content": "To determine how many total rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Rows for Red Tulips**: Jackson can fit 6 red tulips per row, and he has 36 red tulips. To find how many rows he needs for the red tulips, divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row.\n\n2. **Calculate Rows for Blue Tulips**: He can fit 8 blue tulips per row, and he has 24 blue tulips. To find how many rows he needs for the blue tulips, divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row.\n\n3. **Calculate Rows for Yellow Tulips**: Jackson can fit 5 yellow tulips per row, and he has 30 yellow tulips. To find how many rows he needs for the yellow tulips, divide the total number of yellow tulips by the number of tulips per row.\n\n4. **Determine Total Rows**: Since he places a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips, calculate how many extra rows of yellow tulips are needed. The yellow rows must be equal to or one less than the sum of red and blue rows due to alternating placement.\n\nLet's solve this using the provided instructions:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the number of rows needed for each color tulip\nred_tulips, red_per_row = 36, 6\nblue_tulips, blue_per_row = 24, 8\nyellow_tulips, yellow_per_row = 30, 5\n\n# Calculate number of rows for each color\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_per_row\nyellow_rows = yellow_tulips // yellow_per_row\n\n# Total number of rows, including additional yellow rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\n# Print the result using fractions or radicals\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Red Tulips**: \n   - \\(36 \\div 6 = 6\\) rows\n\n2. **Blue Tulips**: \n   - \\(24 \\div 8 = 3\\) rows\n\n3. **Yellow Tulips**:\n   - \\(30 \\div 5 = 6\\) rows\n\n4. **Total Rows**:\n   - Total rows of red and blue tulips is \\(6 + 3 = 9\\)\n   - He needs a total of 6 yellow rows, which fit exactly the alternating pattern.\n\nSince \\(6 + 3 + 6 = 15\\), Jackson will plant a total of \\( \\boxed{15} \\) rows of flowers."
