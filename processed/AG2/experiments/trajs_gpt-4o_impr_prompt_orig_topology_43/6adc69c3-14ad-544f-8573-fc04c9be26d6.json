Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. Each final is cut into 5 cm. How long is the ribbon?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Determine the length of each final cut part**: Each final part is cut into \\(5\\) cm pieces.\n\n2. **Determine the number of final parts in each of the four equal initial pieces**: Each of the initial pieces is further divided into 5 equal parts.\n\n3. **Determine the original length of the ribbon**:\n   - Since each final part is \\(5\\) cm and each of the initial 4 pieces is divided into 5 parts, each initial piece contributes \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) cm.\n   - Since there are 4 equal initial pieces, the total length of the ribbon is \\(4 \\times 25\\).\n\nLet's calculate it using Python.\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Each final part is 5 cm\nfinal_part_length = 5\n\n# Each of the initial 4 pieces is divided into 5 parts\nparts_per_initial_piece = 5\n\n# Calculate the length of each initial part\nlength_per_initial_piece = final_part_length * parts_per_initial_piece\n\n# Total number of initial pieces is 4\ntotal_initial_pieces = 4\n\n# Calculate the total length of the ribbon\ntotal_ribbon_length = length_per_initial_piece * total_initial_pieces\n\n# Output the total length of the ribbon\nprint(Rational(total_ribbon_length))\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculation of Each Initial Part Length**:\n   - Each final part is \\(5\\) cm, and there are \\(5 \\) parts, so each initial piece is \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) cm long.\n\n2. **Total Ribbon Length**:\n   - There are 4 initial pieces, each \\(25\\) cm long, so the total ribbon length should be \\(4 \\times 25 = 100\\) cm.\n\nAfter verifying each calculation step, we find that the calculations are correct.\n\nThus, the length of the ribbon is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) cm."
