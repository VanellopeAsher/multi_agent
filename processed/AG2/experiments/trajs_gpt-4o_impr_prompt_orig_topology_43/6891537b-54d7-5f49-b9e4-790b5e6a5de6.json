Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many students Miss Maria has, we should first calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria possesses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate Total Number of Cards:**\n\n   - Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, with each deck containing 25 cards.\n     Therefore, the total number of basketball cards is: \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 25 = 150\n     \\]\n\n   - Miss Maria also has 5 boxes of baseball cards, with each box containing 40 cards. \n     Therefore, the total number of baseball cards is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 40 = 200\n     \\]\n\n   - By adding the basketball and baseball cards, we find Miss Maria's total number of cards:\n     \\[\n     150 + 200 = 350\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Cards Miss Maria Keeps and Gives Away:**\n\n   - Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.\n\n   - Thus, the remaining number of cards she gives to her students is:\n     \\[\n     350 - 50 = 300\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Number of Students:**\n\n   - Each student receives 10 cards. Therefore, the number of students can be calculated by dividing the total number of cards distributed to students by the number of cards each student gets:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{300}{10} = 30\n     \\]\n\nThus, Miss Maria has 30 students. Letâ€™s print the result using Python to fulfill the problem's requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# total number of cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\n\n# cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_kept = 50\ncards_for_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# each student receives 10 cards\ncards_per_student = 10\nnumber_of_students = Rational(cards_for_students, cards_per_student)\n\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Total basketball cards calculation: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\)\n2. Total baseball cards calculation: \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\)\n3. Total cards available: \\(150 + 200 = 350\\)\n4. Cards Miss Maria keeps: \\(350 - 50 = 300\\)\n5. Cards per student: \\(300 \\div 10 = 30\\)\n\nEvery step verifies correctly. The final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]"
