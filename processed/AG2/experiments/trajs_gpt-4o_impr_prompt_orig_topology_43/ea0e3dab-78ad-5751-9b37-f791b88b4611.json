Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month. If the streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged her 15% less money on the other half of the year, calculate the total amount she had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service over the year, given the discount applied during the second half of the year. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for the first 6 months at the original price.\n2. Determine the discounted price for the remaining 6 months.\n3. Calculate the total cost for the discounted period.\n4. Sum the costs of both periods to find the total amount paid.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the described steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the original monthly charge\nmonthly_charge = 200\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first 6 months\ncost_first_half = 6 * monthly_charge\n\n# Define the discount rate (15%)\ndiscount_rate = Rational(15, 100)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the discounted monthly charge for the second half of the year\ndiscounted_monthly_charge = monthly_charge * (1 - discount_rate)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the second 6 months\ncost_second_half = 6 * discounted_monthly_charge\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total amount paid by the end of the year\ntotal_cost = cost_first_half + cost_second_half\n\n# Output the total cost in fractional form\nprint(\"Total amount paid:\", total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service:\n\n1. First half cost = \\( 6 \\times 200 = 1200 \\).\n2. Discounted cost per month = \\( 200 \\times (1 - \\frac{15}{100}) = 200 \\times 0.85 = 170 \\).\n3. Second half cost = \\( 6 \\times 170 = 1020 \\).\n4. Total annual cost = \\( 1200 + 1020 = 2220 \\).\n\nSo the total cost Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is 2220."
