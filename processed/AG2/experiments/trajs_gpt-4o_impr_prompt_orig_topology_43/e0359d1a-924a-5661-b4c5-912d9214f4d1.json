Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll utilize the approach of sharing the total amount of candy equally among Robert, Cindy, and Aaron. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Candy**: First, we need to add up the candy each person has to find the total.\n\n2. **Divide Equally**: Since they are sharing the candy equally, we will divide the total candy by the number of people (which is 3).\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the amount of candy each person has in pounds\nrobert_candy = 3\ncindy_candy = 5\naaron_candy = 4\n\n# Calculate the total amount of candy\ntotal_candy = robert_candy + cindy_candy + aaron_candy\n\n# Calculate how much candy each person will have if they share equally\nshared_candy = Rational(total_candy, 3)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Each person will have\", shared_candy, \"pounds of candy.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Total Candy Calculation**:\n   - Robert: 3 pounds\n   - Cindy: 5 pounds\n   - Aaron: 4 pounds\n\n   Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds\n\n2. **Equal Sharing**:\n   - Divide the total candy by 3 (as there are 3 people): \\( \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\).\n\nThis confirms that each person will receive an equal amount of 4 pounds of candy.\n\n\\(\\boxed{4}\\)"

Just to confirm, the procedural steps and calculations lead to the conclusion that:\n\nRobert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. The total candy was 12 pounds.
