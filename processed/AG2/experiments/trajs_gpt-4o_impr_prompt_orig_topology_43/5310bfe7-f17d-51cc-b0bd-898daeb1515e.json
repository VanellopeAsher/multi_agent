Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 30 more goals than Mark and scored 55 more goals than Anna. If Richie scored 90 goals, how many goals did all three teenagers score?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many goals each teenager scored based on the given relationships. We can then sum those numbers to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.\n\nGiven:\n- Richie scored 90 goals.\n- Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n- Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\nLet's denote the number of goals scored by:\n- Richie: \\( R \\)\n- Mark: \\( M \\)\n- Anna: \\( A \\)\n\nFrom the problem, we are given:\n\\[ R = 90 \\]\n\\[ R = M + 30 \\]\n\\[ R = A + 55 \\]\n\nWith Richie's goals known (\\( R = 90 \\)), we can substitute \\( R \\) into the equations for \\( M \\) and \\( A \\) to solve for them.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate Mark's Goals:**\n   \\[\n   M = R - 30 = 90 - 30 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Anna's Goals:**\n   \\[\n   A = R - 55 = 90 - 55 = 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Goals:**\n   Sum the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Goals} = R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35 = 185\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna is \\( \\boxed{185} \\).\n\n### Verification:\n\n- Richie scored 90 goals, which is consistent with \\( R = 90 \\).\n- Mark's goals: \\( M = 90 - 30 = 60 \\), checks out.\n- Anna's goals: \\( A = 90 - 55 = 35 \\), checks out.\n- Summing these gives \\( 90 + 60 + 35 = 185 \\), consistent with previous calculations.\n\nThe calculations are correct, and the number of goals scored by all three teenagers is indeed \\( \\boxed{185} \\)."
