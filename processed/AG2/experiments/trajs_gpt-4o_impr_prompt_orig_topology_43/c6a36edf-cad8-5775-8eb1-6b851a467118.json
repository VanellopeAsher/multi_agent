Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nUpon the conclusion of the academic year, Kate requested her instructor for the 3 containers of 64 crayons that were all reduced to tiny fragments.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many crayon muffins Kate can make from the fragments of crayons she has, and then calculate the total amount of money she can earn from selling them.\n\n**Key Concept:**\n1. Each container has 64 crayon fragments.\n2. Kate has 3 containers, so the total number of fragments is \\(3 \\times 64\\).\n3. Each muffin requires 8 fragments.\n4. Each muffin can be sold for $1.50.\n\n**Steps to Solve the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Fragments:**\n   - Multiply the number of containers by the number of fragments per container.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Crayon Muffins:**\n   - Divide the total number of fragments by the number of fragments required per muffin.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Earnings:**\n   - Multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Constants\nfragments_per_container = 64\nnumber_of_containers = 3\nfragments_per_muffin = 8\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(3, 2)  # $1.50 as a fraction\n\n# Calculations\ntotal_fragments = number_of_containers * fragments_per_container\nnumber_of_muffins = total_fragments // fragments_per_muffin\ntotal_earnings = number_of_muffins * price_per_muffin\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Total Earnings: ${total_earnings}\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. Total fragments calculation: \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\). This is correct as per the multiplication of the number of containers and fragments.\n2. Number of muffins: \\(192\\) fragments divided by \\(8\\) fragments per muffin equals \\(24\\). This division is integer and straightforward.\n3. Total earnings: \\(24\\) muffins multiplied by $1.50 equals $36.\n\nHaving verified these steps, we can confidently conclude that the total amount of money Kate can earn is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{36}\\)"
