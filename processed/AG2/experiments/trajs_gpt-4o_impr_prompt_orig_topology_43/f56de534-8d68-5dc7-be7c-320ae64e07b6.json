Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces, and anther one that had 125 pieces than the 500 piece one.

We will consider each of the lego sets described in the problem statement and compute their total.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial lego set:** 500 pieces.\n\n2. **Second lego set:** 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pieces in second set} = 3 \\times 500 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third lego set:** 1/4 of the number of pieces of the 500 piece set.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pieces in third set} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth lego set:** 125 pieces more than the 500 piece set.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pieces in fourth set} = 500 + 125 = 625\n   \\]\n\nNow, we add up the pieces from each set to get the total number of pieces Johnny picks up.\n\n5. **Total pieces:** Add all the pieces together.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total} = 500 + 1500 + 125 + 625\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this sum using Python:\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the total number of pieces\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of pieces in each set\npieces_set_1 = 500\npieces_set_2 = 3 * pieces_set_1\npieces_set_3 = Rational(1, 4) * pieces_set_1\npieces_set_4 = pieces_set_1 + 125\n\n# Total pieces\ntotal_pieces = pieces_set_1 + pieces_set_2 + pieces_set_3 + pieces_set_4\nprint(total_pieces)\n```\n\nNow let's move on to the calculation and verification.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Check each calculation step manually or using a calculator**:\n   - Pieces in second set: \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\)\n   - Pieces in third set: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125\\)\n   - Pieces in fourth set: \\(500 + 125 = 625\\)\n\n2. **Sum up these values to ensure correctness**:\n   \\[\n   500 + 1500 + 125 + 625 = 2750\n   \\]\n\nAfter verifying each step and the final sum, it is confirmed that our solution is correct.\n\nThe total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is \\(\\boxed{2750}\\)."
