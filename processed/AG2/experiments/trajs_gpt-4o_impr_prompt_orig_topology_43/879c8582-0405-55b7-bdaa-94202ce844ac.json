      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students received cards from Miss Maria. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards.\n3. Add the number of rare soccer cards to the total.\n4. Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps for herself.\n5. Determine how many students received cards by dividing the remaining cards by the number of cards each student gets.\n\nLet's calculate everything step by step using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Total number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards_per_deck = 25\nnumber_of_basketball_decks = 6\ntotal_basketball_cards = basketball_cards_per_deck * number_of_basketball_decks\n\n# Total number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards_per_box = 40\nnumber_of_baseball_boxes = 5\ntotal_baseball_cards = baseball_cards_per_box * number_of_baseball_boxes\n\n# Total number of rare soccer cards\nrare_soccer_cards = 30\n\n# Total number of all cards\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards + rare_soccer_cards\n\n# Cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_miss_maria_keeps = 50\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_miss_maria_keeps\n\n# Number of students\ncards_per_student = 10\nnumber_of_students = cards_given_to_students / cards_per_student\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Number of students:\", number_of_students)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the steps in the VERIFICATION section:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Basketball Cards:**\n   - 6 decks × 25 cards = 150 cards.\n\n2. **Baseball Cards:**\n   - 5 boxes × 40 cards = 200 cards.\n\n3. **Rare Soccer Cards:**\n   - 30 cards.\n\n4. **Total Cards:**\n   - 150 (basketball) + 200 (baseball) + 30 (soccer) = 380 cards.\n\n5. **Cards Given to Students:**\n   - Total cards: 380 - Miss Maria keeps: 50 = 330 cards.\n\n6. **Number of Students:**\n   - Cards given: 330 / Cards per student: 10 = 33 students.\n\nThe calculations are consistent, and the solution is confirmed.\n\nThe number of students Miss Maria has is \\( \\boxed{33} \\)."
