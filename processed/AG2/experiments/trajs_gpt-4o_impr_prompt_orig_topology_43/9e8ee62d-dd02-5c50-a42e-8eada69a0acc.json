Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another inches in the third week and the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inces tall. How many inches did the beanstalk grow in the third week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the growth of the beanstalk in its third week.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach:\n\n**Step 1: Understand Initial Growth**\n\n1. **First Week:**\n   - The beanstalk was 3 inches tall.\n\n2. **Second Week:**\n   - The beanstalk doubled in height, so its height at the end of the second week was \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Height in Third Week**\n\n- By the end of the third week, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.\n- Thus, the growth in the third week is the difference between the final height and the height at the end of the second week:\n  \n\\[ \\text{Growth in third week} = \\text{Height at end of third week} - \\text{Height at end of second week} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Growth in third week} = 10 - 6 \\]\n\n### Calculation:\n\nLet's perform the calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python to determine the growth in the third week\ninitial_height = 3\nsecond_week_height = initial_height * 2\nfinal_height = 10\nthird_week_growth = final_height - second_week_height\n\n# Output the result using print in a specified format\nprint(third_week_growth)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Initial height at the end of the first week is 3 inches.\n2. After the second week, the height is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches.\n3. At the end of the third week, the total height is 10 inches.\n4. The growth in the third week: \\(10 - 6 = 4\\) inches.\n\nEach calculation corroborates with the problem statement and logic we have followed.\n\nThe growth of the beanstalk in the third week was \\( \\boxed{4} \\) inches."
