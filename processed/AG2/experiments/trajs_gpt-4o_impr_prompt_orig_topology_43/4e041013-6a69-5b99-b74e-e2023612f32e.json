Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden. He can accommodate 6 red tulips per row and 8 blue tulips per row. If Jackson purchases 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of tulips will he end up planting?"

      "content": "To find out how many rows of tulips Jackson will end up planting, we need to calculate separately the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips by dividing the total number of each type of tulip by the number of tulips per row.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach: Case 1 (Direct Python Solution)\nThe problem can be directly solved by performing simple integer division, which we can easily automate with Python.\n\nLet's go ahead and write a Python program using the steps outlined:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Total number of tulips and tulips per row\ntotal_red_tulips = 36\nred_tulips_per_row = 6\n\ntotal_blue_tulips = 24\nblue_tulips_per_row = 8\n\n# Calculate the number of rows for each type of tulip\nred_rows = total_red_tulips // red_tulips_per_row\nblue_rows = total_blue_tulips // blue_tulips_per_row\n\n# Print the results\nprint('Red tulip rows:', red_rows)\nprint('Blue tulip rows:', blue_rows)\n```\n\nLet's break it down to see what this code does:\n1. We calculate how many rows of red tulips there will be by dividing the total number of red tulips (36) by the number of red tulips per row (6).\n2. We calculate how many rows of blue tulips there will be by dividing the total number of blue tulips (24) by the number of blue tulips per row (8).\n3. We print the results.\n\nRunning this code, we find:\n- For red tulips: \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) rows.\n- For blue tulips: \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\) rows.\n\n**Verification:**\n1. Verify the integer division results:\n   - Red tulips: \\(36 \\div 6 = 6\\) (correct)\n   - Blue tulips: \\(24 \\div 8 = 3\\) (correct)\n2. Check if these computations follow the requirements stated in the problem (use integer division for row calculations).\n\nThe final answer is that Jackson will plant:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\nrows for red tulips and \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\nrows for blue tulips."
