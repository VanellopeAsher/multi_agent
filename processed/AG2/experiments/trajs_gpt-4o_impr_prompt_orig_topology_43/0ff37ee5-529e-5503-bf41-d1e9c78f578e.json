Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. If Ali has $32 after buying the dinner, how many $10 bills does Ali have originally?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's use algebra to set up an equation based on the information provided. We will then use Python to solve it.\n\n**Problem Analysis and Steps:**\n\n1. **Define variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of $10 bills Ali originally has.\n\n2. **Calculate the total initial amount:**\n   - Ali has \\( 10x \\) dollars from the $10 bills.\n   - Ali has \\( 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\) dollars from the $20 bills.\n   - In total, Ali has \\( 10x + 120 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Amount given to his sister:**\n   - Ali gives his sister half of his total money, so he retains half. The remaining money is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) \\).\n\n4. **Amount spent on dinner:**\n   - Ali spends \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\) of the money remaining after giving his sister his share. Thus, the money he spent on dinner is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) \\).\n\n5. **Amount left after buying dinner:**\n   - Ali has $32 remaining after dinner. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) - \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (10x + 120) = 32\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - We solve the equation for \\( x \\) to find the number of $10 bills Ali originally had.\n\nWith this understanding, let's implement the solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the number of $10 bills\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total initial money\ntotal_money = 10*x + 120\n\n# Remaining money after giving half to sister\nremaining_after_sister = (1/2) * total_money\n\n# Money spent on dinner\nspent_on_dinner = (3/5) * remaining_after_sister\n\n# Remaining money after dinner\nremaining_after_dinner = remaining_after_sister - spent_on_dinner\n\n# According to the problem, Ali has $32 left after dinner\nequation = Eq(remaining_after_dinner, 32)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. **Initial Total Calculation:**\n   - Let's calculate the total money with the solution found. Verify it using the equation steps.\n2. **Compartmentalize the amount calculations:**\n   - Verify the calculation for the remaining amount after giving half.\n   - Compute the dinner spending to ensure accuracy.\n3. **Check post-dinner remaining money:**\n   - Verify that the calculation equals $32.\n\nBy ensuring each step corresponds to the statements in the problem, we validate our final output. The code block will output the number of $10 bills, boxed, as required.\n\nLet's execute and verify the solution."
