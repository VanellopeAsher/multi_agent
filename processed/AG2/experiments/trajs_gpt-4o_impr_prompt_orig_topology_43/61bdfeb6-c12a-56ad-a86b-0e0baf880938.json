Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSamwell owns an appliance store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, one-fifth are projection TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?"

      "content": "To determine how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we can use algebra to set up an equation based on the information provided. We have the following fractions representing different types of TV sales:\n\n- Smart TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n- Analog TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n- Projection TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\nThe remaining fraction of sales will be for OLED TVs. Adding these fractions will help us find the fraction of OLED TVs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the total fraction of sales for Smart, Analog, and Projection TVs**:\n   - Smart TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n   - Analog TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n   - Projection TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\n   First, find a common denominator for these fractions.\n\n2. **Add the fractions together**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{10}{40} + \\frac{5}{40} + \\frac{8}{40} = \\frac{23}{40}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the fraction of OLED TV sales**:\n\n   The fraction of TVs that are OLEDs would be the remainder of the total fraction, since all the sales fractions must sum to 1:\n\n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{23}{40} = \\frac{40}{40} - \\frac{23}{40} = \\frac{17}{40}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of OLED TVs sold**:\n\n   Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, we calculate the number of OLED TVs:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of OLED TVs} = \\frac{17}{40} \\times 40 = 17\n   \\]\n\nSo, Samwell sold 17 OLED TVs.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Check the fractional calculation**: \n   - Sum of known fractions: \\(\\frac{10}{40} + \\frac{5}{40} + \\frac{8}{40} = \\frac{23}{40}\\)\n   - Remaining fraction: \\(\\frac{40}{40} - \\frac{23}{40} = \\frac{17}{40}\\).\n\n2. **Verify calculation of OLED TVs**:\n   - Total TVs = 40\n   - OLED TVs fraction \\(\\frac{17}{40}\\)\n   - Calculation: \\(\\frac{17}{40} \\times 40 = 17\\).\n\nEverything checks out correctly.\n\nThus, the number of OLED TVs sold is \\( \\boxed{17} \\)."
