Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

      "content": "To determine how many small shirts Octavia used to make the quilt, we need to solve for the number of small shirts using an equation based on the total area of the quilt.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Define known values**:\n   - Total area of the quilt: 101 square feet.\n   - Area contributed by one small shirt (*s*): 3 square feet.\n   - Area contributed by one medium shirt (*m*): 4 square feet.\n   - Area contributed by one large shirt (*l*): 6 square feet.\n   - Number of medium shirts used: 8\n   - Number of large shirts used: 6\n\n2. **Calculate the area contributed by medium and large shirts**:\n   - Total area from medium shirts: \\(8 \\times 4\\) square feet.\n   - Total area from large shirts: \\(6 \\times 6\\) square feet.\n\n3. **Set up the equation** to find the number of small shirts (*x*):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area from small shirts} + \\text{Area from medium shirts} + \\text{Area from large shirts} = \\text{Total area}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x + 8 \\times 4 + 6 \\times 6 = 101\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the number of small shirts, \\(x\\)**.\n\nLet's code this solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol for the number of small shirts\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total area of the quilt\ntotal_area = 101\n\n# Area contribution calculations\narea_medium_shirts = 8 * 4\narea_large_shirts = 6 * 6\n\n# Set up the equation based on the total area\nequation = Eq(3 * x + area_medium_shirts + area_large_shirts, total_area)\n\n# Solve for the number of small shirts\nnumber_of_small_shirts = solve(equation, x)[0]\nprint(number_of_small_shirts)\n```\n\n### Solution and Verification\n\nThis code solves for \\(x\\) using the total area equation and SymPy's equation solving functionality.\n\nRunning the code will yield the number of small shirts:\n\n```python\nnumber_of_small_shirts = solve(equation, x)[0]\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. Compute the area contributed by medium shirts: \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) square feet.\n2. Compute the area contributed by large shirts: \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) square feet.\n3. Plug back the calculated number of small shirts into \\(3x\\) and verify that the total is 101 square feet:\n   - Total area from small shirts is correctly calculated using solution from code.\n\nUpon solving, we verified the equation and found the correct number of small shirts used, which will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total area} = 3(x) + 32 + 36 = 101 \\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{11}\\), which means Octavia used 11 small shirts."
