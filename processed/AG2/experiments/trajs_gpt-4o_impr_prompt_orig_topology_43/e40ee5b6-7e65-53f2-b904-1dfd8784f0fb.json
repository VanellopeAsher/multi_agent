Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon. Given that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5, can you determine the total sum of money she expended on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the Price of Jars**: \n   - We know the price of a one-gallon jar is $5.\n   - Let the price of a half-gallon jar be \\( P \\).\n   - According to the problem, the one-gallon jar is $2 more expensive than the half-gallon jar:  \n     \\[\n     5 = P + 2\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( P \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost**:\n   - Once we find \\( P \\), calculate the total cost for 10 one-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.\n\n### Python Code Solution\n\nLet's use Python to calculate the price of the half-gallon jar and then compute the total expenditure.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nP = symbols('P')\n\n# Given information\nequation = Eq(5, P + 2)\n\n# Solve for P\nprice_of_half_gallon = solve(equation, P)[0]\n\n# Calculate total cost\ncost_one_gallon_jars = 5 * 10\ncost_half_gallon_jars = price_of_half_gallon * 16\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_one_gallon_jars + cost_half_gallon_jars\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We set up the equation  \\(5 = P + 2\\) to find the price \\(P\\) of the half-gallon jar.\n- Substitute and calculate total costs:\n  - \\(10\\) jars of 1 gallon cost: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\)\n  - \\(16\\) jars of half-gallon cost: \\(16 \\times P\\) (calculated in the code)\n- Sum the costs for both types of jars for the total expenditure.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify our calculations manually:\n\n1. Solving the equation \\(P + 2 = 5\\), we find:\n   \\[\n   P = 5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n2. Check total costs:\n   - Cost of 10 one-gallon jars: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\)\n   - Cost of 16 half-gallon jars: \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\)\n   - Total cost: \\(50 + 48 = 98\\)\n\nTherefore, the verified total cost that Cecelia expended is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{98}\n\\]"
