Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. During his recovery, he managed to regain 5 pounds per month for 2 months. If his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight before he fell ill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we follow a step-by-step process using basic arithmetic. We need to determine Mark's initial weight before he became unwell, considering the changes in his weight during and after his illness.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Weight Loss:**\n   - Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.\n   - Total weight lost during the illness: \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\) pounds.\n\n2. **Identify the Weight Gain:**\n   - After his illness, Mark regained 5 pounds per month for 2 months.\n   - Total weight regained during recovery: \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) pounds.\n\n3. **Calculate the Net Weight Change:**\n   - Net weight loss = Total weight lost - Total weight regained\n   - Net weight loss = \\(30 - 10 = 20\\) pounds.\n\n4. **Determine the Initial Weight:**\n   - Let \\(x\\) be Mark's initial weight.\n   - After losing 20 pounds, his final weight is 70 pounds.\n   - Therefore, his initial weight \\(x\\) must satisfy: \\(x - 20 = 70\\).\n\nSolving this equation for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx - 20 = 70 \\implies x = 70 + 20 = 90\n\\]\n\nThus, Mark's initial weight before he fell ill was 90 pounds.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. Start with the initial weight \\(x = 90\\) pounds.\n2. Subtract the total weight lost (30 pounds) during his illness, leaving him with 60 pounds.\n3. Add the weight regained (10 pounds) during recovery, resulting in a final weight of 70 pounds.\n4. This matches the given final weight, confirming the calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the initial weight of Mark was \\(\\boxed{90}\\) pounds."
