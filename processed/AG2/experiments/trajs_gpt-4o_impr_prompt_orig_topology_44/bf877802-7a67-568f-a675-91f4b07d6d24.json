Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total angle from the ground to the sun after the specified period using the rate at which the sun moves.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe need to account for the movement of the sun across two different time periods with different rates of ascent. Our task is to first calculate the angle formed after the sun moves at 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours, and then continue with an angle increase of 3 degrees per hour for an additional 2 hours.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Initial Angle**: The initial angle given from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees.\n\n2. **First Movement (10 hours at 5 degrees/hour)**:\n   - Calculate the angle increase: \\(10 \\text{ hours} \\times 5 \\text{ degrees/hour} = 50 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n   \n   - Add this to the initial angle to get the new angle after 10 hours: \\(32 \\text{ degrees} + 50 \\text{ degrees} = 82 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\n3. **Second Movement (2 hours at 3 degrees/hour)**:\n   - Calculate the angle increase: \\(2 \\text{ hours} \\times 3 \\text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n   \n   - Add this to the angle after the first movement to get the final angle: \\(82 \\text{ degrees} + 6 \\text{ degrees} = 88 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\n### Final result\nThe angle from the ground to the sun after the entire motion is completed is 88 degrees.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n- The calculations seem correct:\n  - Movement for 10 hours at 5 degrees/hour yields an increase of 50 degrees.\n  - Additional movement for 2 hours at 3 degrees/hour gives an increase of 6 degrees.\n  - Initial angle: 32 degrees.\n  - Total angle after 12 hours: 88 degrees.\n  - Each step aligns with the given data and rates.\n\nWe have confirmed that our calculations are correct.\n\nNow, outputting the result:\n\n```python\n# Output result\nprint(88)\n```"
