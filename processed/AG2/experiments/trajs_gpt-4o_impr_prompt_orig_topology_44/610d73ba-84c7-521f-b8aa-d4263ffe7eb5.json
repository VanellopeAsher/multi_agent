Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPaisley, Reggie, and Lynn went for a run. Paisley covered a distance of 4 miles. Reggie ran a distance that was five times the distance that Paisley ran and also 3 miles more than what Lynn ran. Can you determine the distance that Lynn ran?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Lynn ran.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Known Quantities:**\n   - Paisley ran 4 miles.\n   - Reggie ran a distance five times the distance Paisley ran.\n   - Reggie's distance is also 3 miles more than Lynn's distance.\n\n2. **Translate this information into Equations:**\n   - Let \\( L \\) represent the distance Lynn ran.\n   - Reggie’s distance can be expressed in two ways:\n     - As five times the distance Paisley ran: \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) miles.\n     - As 3 miles more than Lynn's distance: \\( L + 3 \\).\n\n3. **Set the two expressions for Reggie's distance equal to each other:**\n   - \\( 20 = L + 3 \\).\n\n4. **Solve the equation for \\( L \\):**\n\nHere, we'll use Python to solve for \\( L \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(20, L + 3)\n\n# Solve for L\nlynn_distance = solve(equation, L)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Lynn ran {lynn_distance} miles.\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the distance Lynn ran based on the conditions given in the problem.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Reggie’s distance as five times Paisley’s distance is \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) miles.\n2. Solving the equation \\( 20 = L + 3 \\) gives \\( L = 17 \\).\n\nThus, Lynn ran 17 miles, which matches the conditions provided.\n\nTherefore, Lynn ran \\(\\boxed{17}\\) miles."

Let's consolidate the solution using our structured methodology and put it in the final boxed format:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the Known Quantities and Relationships:**\n   - Paisley ran 4 miles.\n   - Reggie ran 5 times as far as Paisley.\n   - Reggie also ran 3 miles more than Lynn.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - Distance Reggie ran: \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) miles.\n   - Let \\( L \\) represent the distance Lynn ran.
