Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total amount Suzie spent on the four packs of gum. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Suzie bought four packs of gum: two packs of strawberry, one pack of grape, and one pack of green apple.\n- Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.\n- The pack of grape gum costs $2.\n- The pack of green apple gum costs half as much as a pack of grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1. **Cost of Strawberry Gum:**\n   - 2 packs of strawberry gum at $2 each cost: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) dollars\n\n2. **Cost of Grape Gum:**\n   - 1 pack of grape gum costs: \\(2\\) dollars\n\n3. **Cost of Green Apple Gum:**\n   - 1 pack of green apple gum costs: \\(1\\) dollar\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   - Combine the costs for all packs: \\(4 + 2 + 1 = 7\\) dollars\n\nLet's put this into Python code for clarity and adherence to the requested format:\n\n```python\n# Calculation using Python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs for each type of gum\ncost_strawberry = 2 * 2  # 2 packs at $2 each\ncost_grape = 2  # 1 pack at $2\ncost_green_apple = Rational(1, 2) * 2  # 1 pack at half the grape gum price\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_strawberry + cost_grape + cost_green_apple\n\n# Display the total amount paid by Suzie\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nUpon executing the above code, Suzie's total payment results in $7. Therefore, the total amount Suzie paid is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]"
