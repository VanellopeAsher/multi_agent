Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day. He worked for an entire week, during which he also babysat his neighbor's kids for 2 hours each day at a rate of $0. However, he spent a total of $100 on groceries and other necessities. How much money does he have left?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week from his daycare job, and then subtract his expenses to find out how much money he has left. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this:\n\n1. **Calculate Earnings from the Daycare Job:**\n   - Gerald earns $30 per day.\n   - He worked for an entire week (7 days), so his total earnings from the daycare job can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total earnings} = 30 \\, \\text{dollars/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Babysitting Earnings:**\n   - He earned $0 for babysitting 2 hours each day for the same week, so we can ignore this part as it doesn't contribute to his earnings.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Expenses:**\n   - Gerald spent $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n\n4. **Calculate Remaining Money:**\n   - Subtract the total expenses from Gerald's earnings to find out how much he has left:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining money} = \\text{Total earnings} - \\text{Total expenses}\n     \\]\n\nLet's proceed to calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define given values\ndaily_earnings = 30  # dollars per day\ndays_worked = 7\nexpenses = 100  # dollars\n\n# Calculate total earnings from the daycare job\ntotal_earnings = daily_earnings * days_worked\n\n# Calculate remaining money after expenses\nremaining_money = total_earnings - expenses\n\n# Output the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\nNow let's proceed with the calculation.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Daily Earnings Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 7 = 210 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Remaining Money Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   210 - 100 = 110 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nAfter verifying each step, the calculations confirm that Gerald has $110 left after his week's earnings and expenses.\n\nFinal result:\n\\[\n\\boxed{110}\n\\]"
