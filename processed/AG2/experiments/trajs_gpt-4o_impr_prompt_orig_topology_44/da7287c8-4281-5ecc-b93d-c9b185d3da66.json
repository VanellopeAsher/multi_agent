Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTerry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, nine burger platters for $11.5 each, and half of 40 sodas for $1.50 each. How much money does he make in total?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of calculating Terry's total income from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Determine the Income from Milkshakes:**  \n   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.\n   - Income from milkshakes = Number of milkshakes sold × Price per milkshake.\n\n2. **Determine the Income from Burger Platters:**  \n   - Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11.50 each.\n   - Income from burger platters = Number of burger platters sold × Price per burger platter.\n\n3. **Determine the Income from Sodas:**  \n   - Terry sells half of 40 sodas, which is \\( \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\) sodas, at $1.50 each.\n   - Income from sodas = Number of sodas sold × Price per soda.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Income:**  \n   - Total income = Income from milkshakes + Income from burger platters + Income from sodas.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**  \n   - Output the total income using the `print` function.\n\nNow, let's calculate each part using Python.\n\n```python\n# Income from milkshakes\nnum_milkshakes = 6\nprice_per_milkshake = 5.50\nincome_milkshakes = num_milkshakes * price_per_milkshake\n\n# Income from burger platters\nnum_burger_platters = 9\nprice_per_burger_platter = 11.50\nincome_burger_platters = num_burger_platters * price_per_burger_platter\n\n# Income from sodas\nnum_sodas = 40 / 2\nprice_per_soda = 1.50\nincome_sodas = num_sodas * price_per_soda\n\n# Total income\ntotal_income = income_milkshakes + income_burger_platters + income_sodas\n\n# Print the total income\nprint(total_income)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify Each Component:**\n   - Income from 6 milkshakes: \\( 6 \\times 5.50 = 33 \\).\n   - Income from 9 burger platters: \\( 9 \\times 11.50 = 103.5 \\).\n   - Income from 20 sodas: \\( 20 \\times 1.50 = 30 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Income:**\n   - Total income = \\( 33 + 103.5 + 30 = 166.5 \\).\n\nThe calculations have been verified and the total income Terry makes is indeed correct. Therefore, the total income Terry makes is \\(\\boxed{166.5}\\)."
