Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jessica pays on her debts over a year, given she is paying 50% more than the minimum payments. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the minimum monthly payments for each debt:**\n   - Student loans: $300/month\n   - Credit card: $200/month\n   - Mortgage: $500/month\n\n2. **Calculate the increased payment (50% more than minimum):**\n   - 50% of the minimum is calculated using the formula: \\((\\text{minimum payment}) \\times 0.5\\)\n\n3. **Compute the total monthly payment for all debts using the increased amount:**\n   - For each debt, compute \\((\\text{minimum payment}) \\times 1.5\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total yearly payment on debts:**\n   - Sum the adjusted monthly payments for each debt and multiply by 12 (months in a year).\n\n### Using Python for Calculation\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the minimum payments for each debt\nstudent_loan_min = 300\ncredit_card_min = 200\nmortgage_min = 500\n\n# Calculate the 50% more than minimum payments\nstudent_loan_payment = Rational(3, 2) * student_loan_min  # 1.5 times the minimum\ncredit_card_payment = Rational(3, 2) * credit_card_min\nmortgage_payment = Rational(3, 2) * mortgage_min\n\n# Calculate the total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate the total yearly payment for debts\ntotal_yearly_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result in fractional form\nprint(total_yearly_payment)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify each increased payment individually:**\n   - Student loan: \\(300 \\times 1.5 = 450\\)\n   - Credit card: \\(200 \\times 1.5 = 300\\)\n   - Mortgage: \\(500 \\times 1.5 = 750\\)\n\n2. **Sum the increased payments for the total monthly payment:**\n   - Total monthly payment: \\(450 + 300 + 750 = 1500\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the annual total:**\n   - Annual payment: \\(1500 \\times 12 = 18000\\)\n\nAfter verifying and confirming each step, we find that Jessica pays a total of \\( \\boxed{18000} \\) per year on her debts, paying 50% more than the minimum each month."

      "content": "The total amount Jessica pays on her debts annually, when paying 50% more than the minimum each month, is indeed 18,000. The previous Python calculation correctly confirmed this by evaluating the monthly payments and multiplying them by 12 months. \n\nHere is a brief summary of the calculation:\n\n- **Monthly payments with 50% increase:**\n  - Student loans: \\(450\\)\n  - Credit card: \\(300\\)\n  - Mortgage: \\(750\\)\n\n- **Total monthly debt payment:** \\(450 + 300 + 750 = 1500\\)\n- **Total yearly debt payment:** \\(1500 \\times 12 = 18000\\)\n\nThus, Jessica pays a total of \\(\\boxed{18000}\\) per year on her debts."
