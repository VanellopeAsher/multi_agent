      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries. If Robert has 3000 cherries, and has 1000 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?"

Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step (Case 3: Step-by-Step Process):\n\n**Step 1:** Determine how many cherries Richard has.\n\nSince Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard:\n- Number of cherries Richard has = Number of cherries Robert has - 1000\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate how many cherries Jerry has.\n\nGiven that Richard, Jerry, and Robert together have 6000 cherries, we have:\n- Number of cherries Richard has + Number of cherries Jerry has + Number of cherries Robert has = 6000\n\n**Step 3:** Find out how many cherries Jerry has by using the above equation.\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# We know Robert has 3000 cherries, and he has 1000 more than Richard.\nrobert_cherries = 3000\nrichard_cherries = robert_cherries - 1000\n\n# Total cherries shared among Richard, Jerry, and Robert\ntotal_cherries = 6000\n\n# We know the equation: Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries + Robert's cherries = Total cherries\n# So Jerry's cherries can be calculated as:\n# Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Richard's cherries + Robert's cherries)\njerry_cherries = total_cherries - (richard_cherries + robert_cherries)\n\n# Calculate the difference between Robert's cherries and Jerry's cherries\ndifference = robert_cherries - jerry_cherries\n\n# Output the result according to the specified format\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(f\"Richard has {richard_cherries} cherries.\")\nprint(f\"Jerry has {jerry_cherries} cherries.\")\nprint(f\"Robert has {difference} more cherries than Jerry.\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to finalize the solution."
