Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera. Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera after the allowance and the money from selling picture.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the camera based on the given inputs.\n\nKey Information:\n- Jayden already has $70 from selling his pictures.\n- Ava gave Jayden half of her $90 allowance.\n- Jayden is still $85 short of the total amount needed to buy the camera.\n\nLet's denote the cost of the camera as \\( C \\).\n\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution\n\nWe can set up an equation to solve for \\( C \\), the cost of the camera, by using the information provided:\n\n1. Calculate the amount Ava gave to Jayden, which is half of her allowance: \\(\\frac{90}{2}\\).\n2. Combine all Jayden's funds (from selling pictures and Ava's contribution) and find how much more he needs ($85).\n3. Use these values to express the total cost of the camera.\n\nHere's how the equation looks:\n\n\\[\nC = \\text{{money from pictures}} + \\text{{Ava's contribution}} + \\text{{money still needed}}\n\\]\n\nUsing Python and sympy for this, the code would be:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\nmoney_from_pictures = 70\nava_allowance = 90\n\n# Half of Ava's allowance\nava_contribution = ava_allowance / 2\n\n# Money still needed\nmoney_still_needed = 85\n\n# Total cost of the camera\ncamera_cost = money_from_pictures + ava_contribution + money_still_needed\n\nprint(camera_cost)\n```\n\nLet's explain the setup:\n\n1. **Ava's Contribution**: Ava gives half of $90, which is $45.\n2. **Initial Funds**: Jayden starts with $70.\n3. **Money Still Needed**: Jayden needs an additional $85.\n\nTo find the total cost of the camera, sum all the amounts:\n- $70 (money from selling pictures)\n- $45 (Ava's contribution)\n- $85 (additional needed)\n\nSubstitute and simplify:\n\\[ C = 70 + 45 + 85 = 200 \\]\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Confirm Ava's contribution: \\(\\frac{90}{2} = 45\\), correct.\n2. Sum of available funds and needs: \\(70 + 45 + 85 = 200\\), correct.\n\nThe calculated cost \\( C \\) is consistent with the problem constraints and breaks down correctly step-by-step.\n\nTherefore, the cost of the camera is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"

Here's the correct calculation for the cost of the camera:\n\nTo find the cost of the camera \\( C \\), we perform the following calculation:\n\n1. Money Jayden has from pictures: $70\n2. Ava's contribution (half of $90): \\( \\frac{90}{2} = 45 \\)\n3. Additional money needed: $85\n\nAdding these amounts gives us the total cost of the camera:\n\n\\[ C = 70 + 45 + 85 = 200 \\]\n\nThus, the cost of the camera is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]"
