Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $15.00 each and a ballpen at $5.00 each. William bought fifty notebooks and ten ballpens. How much did he spend in all?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how much William spent on notebooks and ballpens, we proceed with the following steps:\n\n### Problem Details\n- Price of one notebook = $15.00\n- Price of one ballpen = $5.00\n- Number of notebooks bought = 50\n- Number of ballpens bought = 10\n\n### Solution Approach\nThis problem is straightforward and can be solved directly using arithmetic operations in Python.\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for notebooks by multiplying the number of notebooks by the price per notebook.\n2. Calculate the total cost for ballpens by multiplying the number of ballpens by the price per ballpen.\n3. Add the total cost of notebooks and ballpens to get the total amount spent.\n\nThis problem fits Case 1: Direct Python Solution because it can be solved with simple arithmetic. Here is the Python code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the prices\nprice_of_notebook = 15\nprice_of_ballpen = 5\n\n# Define the quantities\nnumber_of_notebooks = 50\nnumber_of_ballpens = 10\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost_of_notebooks = price_of_notebook * number_of_notebooks\ntotal_cost_of_ballpens = price_of_ballpen * number_of_ballpens\ntotal_amount_spent = total_cost_of_notebooks + total_cost_of_ballpens\n\n# Display the result\nprint(f\"Total amount spent: ${total_amount_spent}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. Verify the computation of the total cost of notebooks:\n   - \\(50 \\text{ notebooks} \\times 15\\text{ dollars each} = 750 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n2. Verify the computation of the total cost of ballpens:\n   - \\(10 \\text{ ballpens} \\times 5\\text{ dollars each} = 50 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n3. Verify the total amount spent:\n   - \\(750 \\text{ dollars (notebooks)} + 50 \\text{ dollars (ballpens)} = 800 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n\nEach step checks out numerically, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nWilliam spent a total of \\(\\boxed{800}\\) dollars."
