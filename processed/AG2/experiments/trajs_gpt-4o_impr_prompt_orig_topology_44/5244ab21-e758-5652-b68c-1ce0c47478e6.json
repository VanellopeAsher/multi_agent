Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges. She gifted her mother and her sibling two boxes each. She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself and sold the rest. If each box has 20 oranges, can you determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach to track how many oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away, kept for herself, and sold.\n\nFirst, let's outline the key steps:\n\n1. **Initial Calculation**:\n   - Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen (12) boxes of oranges, with each box containing 20 oranges. Thus, the total number of oranges she bought is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ oranges per box} = 240 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Oranges Gifted**:\n   - She gave 2 boxes each to her mother and her sibling. That's a total of \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) boxes.\n   - Therefore, the number of oranges gifted is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ oranges per box} = 80 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Oranges**:\n   - After giving away 80 oranges, the remaining number of oranges is:\n     \\[\n     240 - 80 = 160 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Oranges Kept and Sold**:\n   - She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 = 40 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the number of oranges she sold is the remainder:\n     \\[\n     160 - 40 = 120 \\text{ oranges}\n     \\]\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step solution in Python using the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Calculate total number of oranges\ntotal_oranges = 12 * 20\n\n# Calculate number of oranges gifted to mother and sibling\noranges_gifted = 4 * 20\n\n# Calculate remaining oranges after gifting\nremaining_oranges = total_oranges - oranges_gifted\n\n# Calculate oranges kept for herself\noranges_kept = remaining_oranges // 4\n\n# Calculate oranges sold\noranges_sold = remaining_oranges - oranges_kept\n\n# Output the number of oranges sold\nprint(\"Number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold:\", oranges_sold)\n```\n\nNow, let's validate our solution in the VERIFICATION section.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Total Oranges Calculation**:\n   - Correctly calculated as 240.\n\n2. **Oranges Gifted**:\n   - Calculation of 80 oranges to the mother and sibling is correct.\n\n3. **Remaining Oranges**:\n   - Calculation of 160 remaining oranges after gifting is correct.\n\n4. **Oranges Kept**:\n   - Correct calculation showing she kept 40 oranges for herself.\n\n5. **Oranges Sold**:\n   - Correct calculation showing she sold 120 oranges.\n\nAll calculations check out, and I can confirm the solution is accurate.\n\nHence, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
