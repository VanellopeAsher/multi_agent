Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We can do this by understanding Elliott's total steps and the steps he has taken before the jog.\n\nHere's the breakdown of Elliott's steps:\n1. Elliott aims to walk a total of 10,000 steps a day.\n2. He completed half of his steps walking to and from school, which accounts for \\( \\frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \\) steps.\n3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.\n4. He added 500 steps while shopping.\n5. After his jog, he noted that he still needed to complete 2,000 steps.\n\nNow, let's find out the number of steps Elliott took during his jog. The steps taken before his jog are as follows:\n\n\\[ 5,000 \\text{ (school)} + 1,000 \\text{ (walk with friend)} + 500 \\text{ (shopping)} = 6,500 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nAfter the jog, he needed 2,000 more steps to reach 10,000. Therefore, the steps taken after the previous activities (6,500 steps) but before reaching 10,000 must be from the jog:\n\n\\[ 10,000 - (6,500 + 2,000) = \\text{steps taken during the jog} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the steps taken during the jog\ntotal_steps = 10000\nsteps_school = 5000\nsteps_friend = 1000\nsteps_shopping = 500\nsteps_remaining = 2000\n\n# Total prior steps before the jog\nsteps_before_jog = steps_school + steps_friend + steps_shopping\n\n# Steps taken during the jog\nsteps_jog = total_steps - (steps_before_jog + steps_remaining)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(steps_jog)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the details and computation in the VERIFICATION section.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. Elliottâ€™s total target: 10,000 steps.\n2. Steps completed:\n   - School: 5,000 steps.\n   - Friend: 1,000 steps.\n   - Shopping: 500 steps.\n3. Total steps before jog: 6,500 steps.\n4. He needs 2,000 additional steps after completing the jog.\n5. Remaining steps to reach the target (10,000) after the above: \\(10,000 - 6,500 = 3,500\\).\n\nSince 2,000 steps are remaining after the jog, the jog must have accounted for:\n\n\\[ 3,500 - 2,000 = 1,500 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \\(\\boxed{1500}\\)."
