Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her and donated $15 to a local charity. How much money does she have left from her earnings?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes, then subtract the expenses (money given to her sisters and donation to charity) to find the remaining amount Suzanne has left. Let's follow Case 1: Direct Python Solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Earnings**:\n    - Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so total earnings from cookies = \\(80 \\times 1\\).\n    - She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so total earnings from cupcakes = \\(60 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Expenses**:\n    - Suzanne gave $10 each to her two sisters, so total = \\(10 \\times 2\\).\n    - She donated $15 to a local charity.\n\n3. **Find the Remaining Amount**:\n    - Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find out how much money is left.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import *  # Using sympy for symbolic calculation, even if simple in this case\n\n# Calculate total earnings from cookies and cupcakes\nearnings_from_cookies = 80 * 1\nearnings_from_cupcakes = 60 * 4\ntotal_earnings = earnings_from_cookies + earnings_from_cupcakes\n\n# Calculate total expenses\nexpenses_for_sisters = 10 * 2\ncharity_donation = 15\ntotal_expenses = expenses_for_sisters + charity_donation\n\n# Calculate remaining money\nremaining_money = total_earnings - total_expenses\n\n# Output the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify Earnings**:\n   - Cookies: 80 cookies \\(\\times\\) $1 = $80.\n   - Cupcakes: 60 cupcakes \\(\\times\\) $4 = $240.\n   - Total earnings: $80 + $240 = $320.\n\n2. **Verify Expenses**:\n   - Sisters: 2 \\(\\times\\) $10 = $20.\n   - Charity: $15.\n   - Total expenses: $20 + $15 = $35.\n\n3. **Verify Remaining Money**:\n   - Remaining: Total earnings \\(-\\) Total expenses = $320 - $35 = $285.\n\nThrough verification, every calculation aligns, confirming our result is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\(\\boxed{285}\\)"
