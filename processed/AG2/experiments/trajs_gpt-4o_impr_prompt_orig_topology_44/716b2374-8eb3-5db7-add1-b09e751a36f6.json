Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine Kim's total expenses and then calculate the cost of each pack of cloths. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Determine Total Income and Profit**:\n   - Total Weekly Income: $92\n   - Profit: $20\n\n2. **Calculate Total Expenses**:\n   - Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses\n   - Therefore, Total Expenses = Total Income - Profit\n   - Total Expenses = $92 - $20 = $72\n\n3. **Number of Clients**:\n   - Kim currently serves 3 clients and is expecting 5 more, so he has a total of 8 clients.\n\n4. **Calculate Expenses on Bleach**:\n   - Each client’s home requires 2 bottles of bleach.\n   - Total bottles needed = 8 clients × 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles\n   - Each bottle costs $2, so total cost for bleach = 16 bottles × $2 = $32\n\n5. **Determine Cost of Cloths**:\n   - Total expenses include the cost of bleach and cloths.\n   - Therefore, Total Expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths\n   - $72 (Total Expenses) = $32 (Cost of bleach) + Cost of cloths\n   - Cost of cloths = $72 - $32 = $40\n\n6. **Find the Cost per Pack of Cloths**:\n   - Total cost of cloths is $40, spread across 8 clients.\n   - Each client needs 1 pack of cloths.\n   - Therefore, cost per pack of cloths = $40 ÷ 8 packs = $5 per pack\n\n### Verification\n\n1. Calculate Total Income - Profit = Total Expenses:\n   - $92 - $20 = $72, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\n2. Calculate total bleach cost:\n   - 16 bottles × $2 = $32, confirmed.\n\n3. Calculate total cloths cost and cost per pack:\n   - Total cloths cost = $72 (Total Expenses) - $32 (Bleach Cost) = $40\n   - Cost per pack of cloths = $40 ÷ 8 = $5\n\nThese calculations confirm the accuracy of each step.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# Variables\ntotal_income = 92\nprofit = 20\n\n# Calculate total expenses\ntotal_expenses = total_income - profit\n\n# Number of clients\nclients = 3 + 5\n\n# Cost for bleach\nbottles_per_client = 2\ncost_per_bottle = 2\ntotal_bottles = bottles_per_client * clients\ncost_of_bleach = total_bottles * cost_per_bottle\n\n# Calculate cost of cloths\ncost_of_cloths = total_expenses - cost_of_bleach\ncloths_cost_per_pack = cost_of_cloths / clients\n\n# Print result\nprint(f\"Cost per pack of cloths: ${cloths_cost_per_pack}\")\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will confirm our manual calculation that the cost per pack of cloths is \\( \\boxed{5} \\)."
