Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the gingerbread and apple pie over three days. Let's break down the situation and calculate step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Determine the number of boxes sold each day.**\n   - **Saturday:**\n     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes\n     - Apple Pie = (Sunday apple pie) - 4\n\n   - **Sunday:**\n     - Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes (5 more than Saturday)\n     - Apple Pie: 15 boxes\n  \n   - **Monday:**\n     - Gingerbread: 2 boxes\n     - Apple Pie: 4 boxes\n\n2. **Calculate the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday.**\n   - From Sunday, the apple pie count is given as 15. So on Saturday, Sunny sold \\( 15 - 4 = 11 \\) boxes of apple pie.\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**\n   - Saturday:\n     - Earnings from Gingerbread: \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\)\n     - Earnings from Apple Pie: \\( 11 \\times 15 = 165 \\)\n     - Total: \\( 60 + 165 = 225 \\)\n\n   - Sunday:\n     - Earnings from Gingerbread: \\( 15 \\times 6 = 90 \\)\n     - Earnings from Apple Pie: \\( 15 \\times 15 = 225 \\)\n     - Total: \\( 90 + 225 = 315 \\)\n   \n   - Monday:\n     - Earnings from Gingerbread: \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\)\n     - Earnings from Apple Pie: \\( 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\)\n     - Total: \\( 12 + 60 = 72 \\)\n\n4. **Calculate the total earnings over the three days.**\n   - Total Earnings: \\( 225 + 315 + 72 = 612 \\)\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Saturday’s apple pie check:** Correct as 11 were indeed sold.\n2. **Sunday’s gingerbread check:** Correct as he sold 15, which is 5 more than the 10 on Saturday.\n3. **Summations per day:** Ensure all sums and multiplications align with the breakdown above.\n\nNow, all calculations are verified and accurate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings for three days: } \\boxed{612}\n\\]"
