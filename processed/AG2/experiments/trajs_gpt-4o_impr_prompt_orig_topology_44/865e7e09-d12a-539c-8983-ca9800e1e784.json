Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo girls each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water. Then a boy got 8 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?"

      "content": "Key Idea: To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. We will calculate the amount of water distributed to the girls and the boy, and then determine how much water remains.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water the two girls received.\n2. Calculate the amount of water the boy received.\n3. Subtract the sum of the water given to the girls and the boy from the total amount of water.\n4. Output the remaining water.\n\nWe can use Python code with the sympy package to facilitate calculations involving fractions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total amount of water initially\ntotal_water = 32\n\n# Each girl got 1/4 of the total\nwater_per_girl = Rational(1, 4) * total_water\n\n# Total water taken by two girls\nwater_taken_by_girls = 2 * water_per_girl\n\n# Water taken by the boy\nwater_taken_by_boy = 8\n\n# Total water taken by girls and the boy\ntotal_water_taken = water_taken_by_girls + water_taken_by_boy\n\n# Remaining water\nremaining_water = total_water - total_water_taken\n\n# Print the remaining water\nprint(remaining_water)\n```\n\nNow let's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. Each girl got \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 32 = 8 \\) liters.\n2. Thus, both girls together got \\( 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\) liters.\n3. The boy received 8 liters.\n4. Total water used: \\( 16 \\text{ (girls)} + 8 \\text{ (boy)} = 24 \\) liters.\n5. Remaining water: \\( 32 - 24 = 8 \\) liters.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Checked the water distributed to each person.\n- Double-checked the arithmetic calculations and consistency.\n\nFinal Result: \n\\( \\boxed{8} \\)"
