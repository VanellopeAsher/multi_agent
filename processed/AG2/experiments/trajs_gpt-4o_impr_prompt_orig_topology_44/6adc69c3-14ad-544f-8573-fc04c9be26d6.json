Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. Each final is cut into 5 cm. How long is the ribbon?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to work backwards, using the information provided about the cutting process to determine the original length of the ribbon.\n\n**Key Concept:**\n- We start with the final parts of the ribbon being 5 cm each, and work backwards to determine the total original length.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Final Parts**:\n   - Each of the 4 equal parts is divided into 5 smaller equal parts.\n   - Thus, the total number of smaller parts is \\(4 \\times 5\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Length from Final Parts**:\n   - Each smaller part is 5 cm long.\n   - Total length of ribbon = (number of smaller parts) * (length of each smaller part).\n\n3. **Compute Total Length**:\n   - Using sympy for symbolic calculations to ensure the use of exact fractions or integers.\n\nLet's apply this plan through Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Let x be the original length of the ribbon\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Number of final parts: 4 parts each divided into 5 parts\nnumber_of_final_parts = 4 * 5\n\n# Length of the ribbon is the number of final parts times the length of each part (5 cm)\noriginal_length = number_of_final_parts * 5\n\n# Print the original length of the ribbon\nprint(original_length)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Number of Final Parts:**\n   - \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply by the Length of Each Part:**\n   - \\( 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\text{ cm} \\)\n\nThe original length of the ribbon is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) cm.\n\nWe verified each step, ensuring calculations align logically with the problem's requirements, confirming that the ribbon is indeed 100 cm in length."
