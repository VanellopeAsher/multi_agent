      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGeorge needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000.5. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total cost of the dental work that George needs and then determine how many hours he needs to work to cover the remaining amount after accounting for his deposit.\n\nKey details:\n- Base price per implant: $2000.5\n- Additional cost for the porcelain crown on one implant: $500.5\n- Deposit already made: $600\n- George's hourly wage: $15.3\n\nSteps to solve:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the two implants.\n2. Subtract the deposit from this total.\n3. Determine how many hours George needs to work based on his hourly wage to make up the remaining cost.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Constants\nbase_price_per_implant = 2000.5\ncrown_extra_cost = 500.5\ndeposit = 600\nhourly_wage = 15.3\nnum_implants = 2\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = num_implants * base_price_per_implant + crown_extra_cost\n\n# Subtract the deposit\nremaining_cost = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Calculate the number of hours required\nhours_needed = remaining_cost / hourly_wage\n\n# Display the result\nprint(f\"The number of hours George needs to work: {hours_needed}\")\n```\n\nLet me compute the result using this code."

Total cost calculation:\n   - Two implants cost: \\(2 \\times 2000.5 = 4001.0\\)\n   - Additional cost for the crown: \\(+500.5\\)\n   - Total cost: \\(4001.0 + 500.5 = 4501.5\\)\n\n2. Subtract the deposit:\n   - Remaining cost after deposit: \\(4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5\\)\n\n3. Calculate hours needed:\n   - Hourly wage: \\(15.3\\)\n   - Hours needed: \\(\\frac{3901.5}{15.3} = 255\\)\n\nThe calculation confirms that the number of hours George needs to work is indeed \\( \\boxed{255} \\)."
