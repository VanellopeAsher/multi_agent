Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 100 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's outline the key concepts involved and the necessary computations. \n\n**Key Concept**: We need to determine John's average speed in miles per hour given how many miles he runs weekly and how many hours he runs in total. \n\n**Step-by-Step Process**:\n\n1. **Identify Total Hours Ran**:\n    - John runs for 10 hours on the first day.\n    - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, thus 5 hours each day.\n    - Total hours ran in one week = \\(10 + 5 + 5\\) hours.\n\n2. **Determine Total Distance**: \n    - John runs 100 miles a week. \n\n3. **Calculate Average Speed**:\n    - Average speed = Total distance / Total time.\n    - Total time = 20 hours (from the step 1 calculation).\n\nNow, let's compute using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculating total number of hours John runs in a week\nhours_first_day = 10\nhours_other_days = hours_first_day / 2  # half as much as the first day\ntotal_hours = hours_first_day + 2 * hours_other_days\n\n# Total miles in a week\ntotal_miles = 100\n\n# Average speed in miles per hour\naverage_speed = Rational(total_miles, total_hours)\n\n# Display the result using the print function\nprint(f\"Average Speed: {average_speed} miles per hour\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n1. Check the calculation of hours:\n   - \\(10 + 5 + 5 = 20\\) hours. This seems correct.\n\n2. Verify the total weekly miles:\n   - John runs 100 miles as stated in the problem.\n\n3. Calculate average speed:\n   - With 100 miles and 20 hours: \\(\\frac{100}{20} = 5\\) miles per hour.\n   \nThe solution has been verified with clarity.\n\nFinally, present the solution:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
