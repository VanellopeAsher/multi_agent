Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?"

      "content": "To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his weight loss goal, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Caloric Deficit**: The difference between calories burned and calories consumed.\n- **Weight Loss Calculation**: Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and it takes a deficit of 3500 calories to lose 1 lb.\n\n### Break Down the Problem:\n1. **Calculate Total Calorie Deficit Needed**: \n   - To lose 30 lbs, Andy needs a total calorie deficit of \\( 30 \\, \\text{lbs} \\times 3500 \\, \\text{calories/lb} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days Available**:\n   - From December 31st to July 19th is the timeframe considered.\n\n3. **Compute Daily Calorie Deficit**:\n   - Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find the daily deficit.\n\nLet's compute the solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total calorie deficit needed\nweight_loss_goal = 30  # in pounds\ncalories_per_pound = 3500  # calories needed to burn 1 pound\ntotal_calorie_deficit_needed = weight_loss_goal * calories_per_pound\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th\nstart_date = datetime(year=2023, month=12, day=31)\nend_date = datetime(year=2024, month=7, day=19)\ndays_available = (end_date - start_date).days\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed\ndaily_calorie_deficit = Rational(total_calorie_deficit_needed, days_available)\n\nprint(f\"The daily calorie deficit needed is: {daily_calorie_deficit} calories/day\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Total Calorie Deficit for 30 lbs**: \\( 30 \\times 3500 = 105,000 \\) calories.\n2. **Days Count from December 31st to July 19th**: Let's verify the number of days:\n   - January (31 days) + February (29 days for leap year) + March (31 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) + July (19 days) = 201 days.\n\n3. **Daily Deficit Calculation**: \\( \\frac{105,000 \\text{ calories}}{201 \\text{ days}} = \\frac{350}{67} \\approx 522.39 \\text{ calories/day} \\).\n\nThe program computes the calorie deficit in fractional form for accuracy. Once verified and satisfied, proceed to solution formatting:\n\n\\[ \\text{Boxed result is } \\boxed{\\frac{350}{67}} \\ \\text{calories/day}. \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately \\(\\frac{350}{67}\\) calories per day to achieve his weight loss goal by July 19th."
