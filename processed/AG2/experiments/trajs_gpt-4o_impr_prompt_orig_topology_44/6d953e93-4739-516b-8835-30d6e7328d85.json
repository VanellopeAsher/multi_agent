      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the amount of money earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday, then find how many car tires were repaired on Friday based on the given conditions.\n\n**Problem-Solving Approach:**\n\nWe'll use a direct calculation with algebraic expressions to model the problem. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Earnings on Thursday:**\n   - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.\n   - The charge for one truck tire is $60, hence \\( 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\).\n   - The charge for one car tire is $40, hence \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\).\n   - Total earnings on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520.\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation for Friday:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n   - The mechanic earns $40 per car tire, so on Friday the earnings are \\( 40x \\).\n   - According to the problem, the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday:\n     \\[\n     520 = 40x + 40\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Rearrange the equation:\n     \\[\n     480 = 40x\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{480}{40} = 12\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's write the result in the required code format:\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy library to use symbolic math.\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(40 * x + 40, 520)\n\n# Solve for x\ncar_tires_friday = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(car_tires_friday)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Thursday's Earnings:**\n   - Truck tires: \\( 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\)\n   - Car tires: \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\)\n   - Total: \\( 360 + 160 = 520 \\)\n\n2. **Equation Setup and Solving:**\n   - Equation: \\( 520 = 40x + 40 \\)\n   - Rearranging: \\( 480 = 40x \\)\n   - Solving gives: \\( x = 12 \\)\n\nThe calculations check out, and following our breakdown and verification procedures, the number of car tires repaired on Friday is indeed \\( x = 12 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer, boxed as per instructions, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
