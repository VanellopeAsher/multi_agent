Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. During his recovery, he managed to regain 5 pounds per month for 2 months. If his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight before he fell ill?"

      "content": "To find Mark's initial weight before he fell ill, we can set up an equation based on the changes in his weight over the months he was unwell and during his recovery.\n\nLet's denote Mark's initial weight as \\( x \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Weight Loss:**\n   - Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months. Thus, the total weight loss is \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) pounds.\n\n2. **Weight Gain:**\n   - Mark gained 5 pounds per month for 2 months during his recovery. Thus, the total weight gain is \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) pounds.\n\n3. **Equation for Final Weight:**\n   - Considering his initial weight \\( x \\), after the weight loss and gain, his final weight was 70 pounds.\n   - So, the equation can be set as:\n     \\[\n     x - 30 + 10 = 70\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n     \\[\n     x - 20 = 70\n     \\]\n   - Add 20 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 70 + 20\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 90\n     \\]\n\nHence, Mark's initial weight before he fell ill was 90 pounds.\n\nLet's present this in the required output format:\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for initial weight\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set the equation x - 30 + 10 = 70\nequation = Eq(x - 30 + 10, 70)\n\n# Solve the equation\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Display the result\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Mark lost a total of 30 pounds and then regained 10 pounds.\n- Net change in weight: \\( -30 + 10 = -20 \\) pounds.\n- If his final weight is 70 pounds, adding back the net change in weight (20 pounds), the initial weight should be 90 pounds.\n- Calculation steps have been verified and confirmed to align with the math reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the initial weight of Mark before he fell ill is \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."
