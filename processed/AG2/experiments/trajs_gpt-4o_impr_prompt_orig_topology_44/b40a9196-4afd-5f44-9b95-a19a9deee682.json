Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. If a 10% tax is applied to all items that are not food, what is the total cost of all the items?"

      "content": "To tackle this problem, let's break it down step-by-step and apply the concepts of basic arithmetic and tax calculations.\n\n### Key Idea:\n- Identify which items are subject to tax.\n- Calculate the pre-tax total.\n- Apply the tax to non-food items.\n- Sum the tax amount with the pre-tax total to find the final total cost.\n\n### Items and Costs:\n1. **Milk**: $2 (Food)\n2. **Eggs**: $3 (Food)\n3. **Light bulbs**: $3 (Non-food)\n4. **Cups**: $3 (Non-food)\n5. **Roach traps**: $4 (Non-food)\n\n### Tax:\n- **Non-food items** are subject to a 10% tax.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Calculate the total cost of food and non-food items separately.\n2. Apply tax to the non-food items.\n3. Calculate the total cost considering the tax.\n\n### Python Solution:\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices\nmilk_price = 2\neggs_price = 3\nlight_bulbs_price = 3\ncups_price = 3\nroach_traps_price = 4\n\n# Tax rate\ntax_rate = Rational(10, 100)  # 10% tax\n\n# Identify food and non-food items\nfood_items_total = milk_price + eggs_price\nnon_food_items_total = light_bulbs_price + cups_price + roach_traps_price\n\n# Calculate the tax on non-food items\nnon_food_items_tax = non_food_items_total * tax_rate\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = food_items_total + non_food_items_total + non_food_items_tax\n\n# Output result\nprint(\"Total Cost:\", total_cost)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. **Identify food items**: Milk ($2), Eggs ($3) = $5 total (no tax).\n2. **Identify non-food items**: Light bulbs ($3), Cups ($3), Roach traps ($4) = $10 total.\n3. **Calculate tax on non-food items**: 10% of $10 = $1.\n4. **Final total cost**: $5 (food) + $10 (non-food) + $1 (tax) = $16.\n\nThe Python code performs these calculations and should output:\n- **Total Cost**: 16\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{16}\\)"
