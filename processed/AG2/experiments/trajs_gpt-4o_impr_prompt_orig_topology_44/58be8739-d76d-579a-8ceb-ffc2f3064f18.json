Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll go through a step-by-step process to find out how much time John spent sightseeing.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total time John spent on activities other than sightseeing.\n\n- Boating: 6 hours\n- Swimming: Half of the boating time, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours\n- Watching shows: 3 shows each lasting 2 hours, totaling \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours\n\nSo the total time spent on these activities is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ (boating)} + 3 \\text{ (swimming)} + 6 \\text{ (shows)} = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nStep 2: Determine the total vacation time based on 30% for activities.\n\nLet's denote the total vacation time as \\( T \\). The time spent on these activities (15 hours) represents 30% of the total vacation time. We can set up the equation:\n\\[ 0.3 \\cdot T = 15 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( T \\):\n\\[ T = \\frac{15}{0.3} \\]\n\nStep 3: Calculate \\( T \\) using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, 15)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\nNow, this will give us the total vacation time \\( T \\).\n\nStep 4: Calculate the sightseeing time.\n\nFinally, the time spent sightseeing would be the total vacation time minus the time spent on activities:\n\\[ \\text{Sightseeing time} = T - 15 \\]\n\nLet's calculate the sightseeing time.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the sightseeing time based on total_time\nsightseeing_time = total_time - 15\n\nprint(f'Sightseeing time: {sightseeing_time}')\n```\n\nRun these steps to obtain the result:\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. We calculated the component times correctly.\n2. The equation \\( 0.3 \\cdot T = 15 \\) accurately reflects the relation described in the problem.\n3. Solving for \\( T \\) should yield 50 hours.\n4. Subtracting the 15 hours of known activities from \\( T \\) gives us the correct sightseeing time.\n\nAssuming these calculations are correct, here is the final answer:\n\n\\( \\boxed{35} \\)"

It seems everything checks out with the calculations provided. \n\nLet's recap:\n\n- We found that the total vacation time \\( T \\) was indeed 50 hours.\n- After accounting for the 15 hours spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows, the remaining time for sightseeing is \\( 50 - 15 = 35 \\) hours.\n\nThus, the time John spent sightseeing is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{35}\\) hours."
