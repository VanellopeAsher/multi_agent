Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

At that time:\n  1. He will be half the age of his dad: \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (F + 5) \\).\n  2. He will be twice the age of his brother: \\( 26 = 2 \\times (B + 5) \\).\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Equations**\n\nFirst, solve the equation \\( 26 = 2 \\times (B + 5) \\) for \\( B \\):\n\\[ \n26 = 2(B + 5) \n\\]\n\\[ \n26 = 2B + 10\n\\]\n\\[ \n16 = 2B\n\\]\n\\[ \nB = 8 \n\\]\n\nNow, solve the equation \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (F + 5) \\) for \\( F \\):\n\\[ \n26 = \\frac{1}{2} (F + 5)\n\\]\n\\[ \n52 = F + 5\n\\]\n\\[ \nF = 47 \n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Their Current Ages**\n\nWe are asked to find the sum of the ages of the dad and the brother now:\n\\[ \nF + B = 47 + 8 = 55 \n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nLet's write the code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Given data\nE = 21  # Emil's current age\n\n# Solve for brother's current age (B)\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nB = symbols('B')\nbrother_eq = Eq(26, 2 * (B + 5))\nbrother_current_age = solve(brother_eq, B)[0]\n\n# Solve for father's current age (F)\nF = symbols('F')\nfather_eq = Eq(26, (F + 5) / 2)\nfather_current_age = solve(father_eq, F)[0]\n\n# Calculate the sum of dad's and brother's current ages\nsum_ages = father_current_age + brother_current_age\n\nprint(\"The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:\", sum_ages)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.\n\n### Verification\n\n1. Emil is currently 21.\n2. We solve for the brother's current age: in 5 years, he'll be \\( B + 5 = \\frac{26}{2} = 13 \\), so currently, \\( B = 8 \\).\n3. We solve for the father's current age: in 5 years, \\( F + 5 = 52 \\), so currently, \\( F = 47 \\).\n4. The sum is \\( F + B = 47 + 8 = 55 \\).\n\nThe final verified sum is \\( \\boxed{55} \\)."

To recap, we've determined this sum through the setup and solution of two equations derived from the given age relationships.\n\n### Summary and Final Answer\n\n1. **Variables:**\n   - Emil's current age: 21 years\n   - Brother's current age: \\( B = 8 \\) years\n   - Father's current age: \\( F = 47 \\) years\n\n2. **Problem Setup:**\n   - In 5 years, Emil will be twice as old as his brother: \\( 26 = 2 \\times (B + 5) \\).\n   - In 5 years, Emil will be half the age of his dad: \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (F + 5) \\).\n\n3. **Solution:**\n   - Solving for \\( B \\) yielded the brother's age as 8 years.\n   - Solving for \\( F \\) yielded the father's age as 47 years.\n\n4. **Sum of Current Ages:**\n   - The current sum of Emil's dad and brother's ages is \\( 47 + 8 = 55 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{55}\\).\n\nIf you have any further questions or another problem to solve, please let me know!"
