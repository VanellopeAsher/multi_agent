Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and a half as much the other two days he runs. He rests for 2 hours after each run. How fast does he run?"

He runs on 3 days a week.\n3. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n4. On the other two days, he runs half the time he runs on the first day.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the running time for each day.**\n\n- First day running time: 3 hours.\n- For the other two days: \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours each.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total running time for the week.**\n\nLet's compute the total running time:\n\nTotal running time = \\( 3 \\) hours (first day)  + \\( 1.5 \\times 2 \\) hours (second and third days)\n\n**Step 4: Write Python code to calculate the total running time and pace.**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total miles run in a week\ntotal_miles = 60\n\n# Running hours\nday1_hours = 3\nday2_and_3_hours = Rational(3, 2)  # 1.5 in rational form\n\n# Total running hours\ntotal_running_hours = day1_hours + 2 * day2_and_3_hours\n\n# Calculate speed as miles per hour (mph)\nspeed = Rational(total_miles, total_running_hours)\n\nprint(f\"John's running speed is {speed} miles per hour.\")\n```\n\n**Step 5: Verification**\n\n1. **Calculate the total running time**: \n   \\( 3 + 2 \\times 1.5 = 3 + 3 = 6 \\) hours\n2. **Calculate the pace**:\n   John's total mileage is 60 miles, completed in 6 hours.\n   Therefore, running speed = \\( \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\) miles per hour.\n\nThe calculations match the logic accurately.

John runs a total of 60 miles each week.\n2. He runs 3 days per week.\n3. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n4. On the other two days, he runs half the time he runs on the first day.\n\n**Objective:** Calculate John's running speed in miles per hour.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n**Step 1: Determine John's running time per day.**\n\n- **First Day:** He runs for 3 hours.\n- **Second Day:** He runs for \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours.\n- **Third Day:** He also runs for 1.5 hours (the same as the second day).\n\n**Step 2: Total running time for the week.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total running time} = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate John's speed.**\n\nSince John runs a total of 60 miles in those 6 hours, we calculate the average running speed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet's verify our calculations by using all known information:\n\n1.
