Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. If the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length, how long is the shark?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the shark, given that the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - There are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long.\n   - Combined length of the remoras = \\(2 \\times 6\\) inches.\n   - This total length represents 10% of the shark's body length.\n\n2. **Formulate the Problem:**\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the length of the shark.\n   - According to the problem, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's length. Therefore, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.1L = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   - Solve for \\( L \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - To find the shark's length, we solve the equation for \\( L \\):\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{12}{0.1}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Solution Using Python:**\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure the solution is presented correctly:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given values\ncombined_length_remoras = 12  # inches\n\n# This combined length is 10% of the shark's length\npercentage = Rational(10, 100)\n\n# Set up the equation for the shark's length\nshark_length = combined_length_remoras / percentage\n\n# Print the answer in fractional form if possible\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\nLet's verify the steps:\n- The combined length of the remoras is 12 inches.\n- This represents 10% of the shark's length.\n- Therefore, the equation is correctly set up: \\( 0.1L = 12 \\).\n- Solving for \\( L \\) yields \\( L = \\frac{12}{0.1} = 120 \\).\n\nThe solution is confirmed correct. Thus the length of the shark is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
