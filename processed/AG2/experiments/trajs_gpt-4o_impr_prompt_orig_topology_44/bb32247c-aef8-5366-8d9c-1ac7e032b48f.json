Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was several inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow the systematic approach laid out in the guidelines.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\nJane's beanstalk grows according to a specific sequence:\n1. Initial height after the first week.\n2. The height doubles in the second week.\n3. It grows an additional 4 inches in the third week.\n\nTo develop a solution in Python, we need to establish a formula based on Jane's description and any given or assumed data.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nLet's define:\n- \\( h_1 \\) as the height of the beanstalk after the first week.\n\nThen, the height progresses as follows:\n- After the second week, the height is \\( 2 \\times h_1 \\).\n- After the third week, the height is \\( 2 \\times h_1 + 4 \\).\n\nIt looks like a direct calculation can be programmed using Python by solving for the final height formula. However, since we don't have the initial height, the problem is incomplete.\n\nTherefore, we will return \\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\) as the missing initial height data prevents us from completing the solution.\n\nHere's the Python code structure for clarification:\n\n```python\n# Since initial data is missing (height after the first week), we cannot solve this problem.\n# We return 'None' since there's no way to determine the exact height after 3 weeks.\nprint(\"None\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Check the description of the problem and ensure all stages of growth are clearly accounted for.\n2. Verify if any assumptions on initial height were stated or implied. If none, we confirm the unsolvability.\n3. Ensure no input data has been overlooked in the problem statement.\n\nAs expected, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)."

      "content": "Let's revisit the problem with a structured approach by assuming we have the initial data needed to quantify the height of the beanstalk.\n\n**Assumption:**\nIf the height of the beanstalk after the first week (\\( h_1 \\)) is provided or can be assumed, we can solve it.\n\nSince no numerical height is given, we'll use a variable or assume a hypothetical height. Let’s proceed with symbolically solving using Python to express the formula for the height of the beanstalk.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n1. Let the height after the first week be \\( h_1 \\).\n2. After the second week, the height doubles: \\( h_2 = 2 \\times h_1 \\).\n3. After the third week, it grows by an additional 4 inches: \\( h_3 = 2 \\times h_1 + 4 \\).\n\nHere’s how you would implement this logic in Python with assumed values:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify\n\n# Define the initial height after the first week\nh1 = symbols('h1')  # Height after first week (unknown)\n\n# Calculate the height after the second week\nh2 = 2 * h1\n\n# Calculate the height after the third week\nh3 = h2 + 4\n\n# Simplify and print the final expression for verification\nprint(\"Height after third week:\", h3)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. If you substitute any value for \\( h_1 \\), you can derive the height after the third week.\n2. Ensure the formulation matches all growth periods described.\n\nSince we don't have an initial height value, this setup allows us to capture the relational growth expression, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2 \\times h_1 + 4}\n\\]\n\nWithout knowing \\( h_1 \\), this expression remains symbolic for the final height after three weeks. If an initial height is specified, you can substitute it into \\( h_1 \\) to compute a numeric answer."
