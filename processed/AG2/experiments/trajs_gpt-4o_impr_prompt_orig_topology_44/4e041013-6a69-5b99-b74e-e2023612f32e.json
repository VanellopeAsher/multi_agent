Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden. He can accommodate 6 red tulips per row and 8 blue tulips per row. If Jackson purchases 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of tulips will he end up planting?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining the number of rows of tulips Jackson will plant, we need to consider both the red and blue tulips separately and then combine the results. Here's the structured breakdown of the solution:\n\n### Key Idea:\nEach type of tulip (red and blue) is arranged in rows according to the number of tulips that can fit in one row. We need to calculate how many rows are required for each type and then combine the results to understand the total number of rows Jackson will plant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Red Tulips Calculation:**\n   - Jackson can place 6 red tulips per row.\n   - He has 36 red tulips in total.\n   - Calculate the number of rows for red tulips: \\(\\frac{36 \\text{ red tulips}}{6 \\text{ tulips per row}} = 6 \\text{ rows}\\).\n\n2. **Blue Tulips Calculation:**\n   - Jackson can place 8 blue tulips per row.\n   - He has 24 blue tulips in total.\n   - Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips: \\(\\frac{24 \\text{ blue tulips}}{8 \\text{ tulips per row}} = 3 \\text{ rows}\\).\n\n3. **Total Rows Calculation:**\n   - Since the red and blue tulips do not share rows (i.e., they are arranged separately), the total number of rows will be the sum of the rows used for red and blue tulips.\n   - Total number of rows = 6 red rows + 3 blue rows = 9 rows.\n\n### Python Implementation:\n\n```python\n# We will use Python to express the calculations in the required format.\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of red tulips and rows calculation\nred_tulips = 36\nred_per_row = 6\nred_rows = Rational(red_tulips, red_per_row)\n\n# Number of blue tulips and rows calculation\nblue_tulips = 24\nblue_per_row = 8\nblue_rows = Rational(blue_tulips, blue_per_row)\n\n# Total rows needed\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\n# Output the total number of rows\nprint(\"Total number of rows:\", total_rows)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- **Red Tulips:**\n  - Calculation: \\(36 \\div 6 = 6\\)\n  - This tells us Jackson will plant 6 rows of red tulips.\n\n- **Blue Tulips:**\n  - Calculation: \\(24 \\div 8 = 3\\)\n  - This tells us Jackson will plant 3 rows of blue tulips.\n\n- **Total Rows:**\n  - Sum of the rows for both types of tulips: \\(6 + 3 = 9\\)\n  - This confirms our calculation and matches the sum expected from individual computations.\n\nAfter verifying each step of our solution, we can conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]\n\nJackson will end up planting a total of 9 rows of tulips."

Let's summarize the solution and encapsulate the final result properly.\n\n### Summary:\n\nJackson arranges his tulips in two separate sections - one for red tulips and one for blue tulips. By calculating the number of rows required for each type of tulip and then summing them, we've determined the total number of rows as follows:\n\n1. **Red Tulips:**\n   - Jackson has 36 red tulips.\n   - Each row can accommodate 6 red tulips.\n   - Therefore, the number of rows for red tulips is calculated as: \n     \\[\\text{Rows for red tulips} = \\frac{36}{6} = 6\\]\n\n2. **Blue Tulips:**\n   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips.\n   - Each row can accommodate 8 blue tulips.\n   - Therefore, the number of rows for blue tulips is calculated as:\n     \\[\\text{Rows for blue tulips} = \\frac{24}{8} = 3\\]\n\n3. **Total Rows:**\n   - The total number of rows, combining the red and blue sections, is:\n     \\[\\text{Total Rows} = 6 + 3 = 9\\]\n\nThus, Jackson will plant a total of \\(\\boxed{9}\\) rows of tulips."
