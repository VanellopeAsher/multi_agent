Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.

      "content": "To determine how many lines Sean has to memorize, let's analyze each component step-by-step using the given information.\n\n### Analyzing the Problem:\n1. **Solo Song:**\n   - Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the song.\n\n2. **First Scene:**\n   - The number of lines in the first scene is twice that of the solo song. So, the total number of lines in the first scene is \\( 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\).\n   - One-third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's. Thus, Sean's lines in the first scene are \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36 \\).\n\n3. **Second Scene:**\n   - The number of lines in the second scene is six more than the lines in the solo song, which is \\( 54 + 6 = 60 \\).\n   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines. Thus, Sean's lines in the second scene are \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\).\n   - Since another actor is absent, Sean has to memorize an additional 15 lines in the second scene. Therefore, the total lines he memorizes in the second scene are \\( 48 + 15 \\).\n\n### Calculation using Python:\nLet's compute these values using Python and summing them up to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Solo song\nsolo_song_lines = 54\n\n# First scene\nfirst_scene_total_lines = 2 * solo_song_lines\nfirst_scene_sean_lines = Rational(1, 3) * first_scene_total_lines\n\n# Second scene\nsecond_scene_total_lines = solo_song_lines + 6\nsecond_scene_sean_lines = Rational(4, 5) * second_scene_total_lines\nadditional_lines_second_scene = 15\nsecond_scene_total_sean_lines = second_scene_sean_lines + additional_lines_second_scene\n\n# Total lines Sean has to memorize\ntotal_memorized_lines = solo_song_lines + first_scene_sean_lines + second_scene_total_sean_lines\n\n# Print the result using fractions\nprint(total_memorized_lines)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. **First Scene:**\n   - Calculated lines Sean memorizes: \\( 36 \\) (correct, as \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36 \\)).\n\n2. **Second Scene:**\n   - Sean's initial lines: \\( 48 \\) (correct, as \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\)).\n   - Additional lines: \\( 15 \\).\n   - Total for second scene: \\( 48 + 15 = 63 \\).\n\n3. **Total Number of Lines:**\n   - \\( 54 + 36 + 63 = 153 \\).\n\nAfter performing the calculations and verification, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is boxed{153}."
