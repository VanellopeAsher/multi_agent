Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home. If 30 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's first identify what's given and what's required:\n\n- We are given that two-thirds (\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)) of the students have a desktop computer.\n- We know that 30 students do not have a desktop computer.\n- We need to find the total number of students.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\nLet's denote the total number of students by \\( x \\).\n\n1. If \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the students have a desktop computer, then \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the students do not have one.\n2. We're told that 30 students do not have a desktop computer, which corresponds to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the total students, \\( x \\).\n\nFrom this, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}x = 30\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( x \\).\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(x / 3, 30)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_students = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_students)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. We know that \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the students do not have a computer.\n2. Solving \\(\\frac{1}{3}x = 30\\) gives us \\( x = 90 \\).\n3. Therefore, the total number of students calculated as 90 checks out by matching the condition that \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of 90 is indeed 30.\n\nGiven our calculations and verification, the total number of students is \\( \\boxed{90} \\)."
