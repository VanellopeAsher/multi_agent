Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it. They are red, white, purple, and yellow.   Half the mural is yellow.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow the structured approach and use Case 1 (Direct Python Solution). Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - Total amount of paint used in the mural: 12 pints.\n   - Half of the mural is yellow: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) pints of yellow paint.\n   - The rest of the mural (6 pints) is divided equally among red, white, and purple paints.\n\n2. **Calculate Paint Used:**\n   - Since red, white, and purple amounts are equal, divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of red paint used.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total paint\ntotal_paint = 12\n\n# Calculate yellow paint\nyellow_paint = Rational(1, 2) * total_paint\n\n# Remaining paint for red, white, and purple\nremaining_paint = total_paint - yellow_paint\n\n# Calculate red paint\nred_paint = remaining_paint / 3\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Pints of red paint used:\", red_paint)\n```\n\nLet's go over the steps and ensure correctness:\n\n- Calculate the yellow paint: \\( 6 \\) pints (half the total).\n- Calculate the remaining paint (red, white, purple): \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\) pints.\n- Divide the remaining 6 pints equally among the three colors. Each color gets \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints.\n\nNow, I'll verify the solution:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Half of the mural is yellow:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yellow paint} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Remaining paint for red, white, and purple:**\n   \\[\n   12 - 6 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equal amounts for red, white, and purple:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Red paint} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculation confirms the logic is correct, and thus the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\] pints of red paint was used."
