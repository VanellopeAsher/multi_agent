Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can directly calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses over 12 weeks and then convert that number to dozens. We'll use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in 12 weeks.\n2. Determine how many eggs Claire uses per day and then multiply by the total number of days.\n3. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.\n\nHere's the Python code using this approach:\n\n```python\n# Number of weeks\nweeks = 12\n\n# Eggs used per day\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# Days per week\ndays_per_week = 7\n\n# Calculate total eggs\ntotal_days = weeks * days_per_week\ntotal_eggs = total_days * eggs_per_day\n\n# Convert to dozens\neggs_per_dozen = 12\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / eggs_per_dozen\n\n# Print the result in fractional or whole form as per the requirements\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nresult = Rational(dozens_of_eggs)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. There are 7 days in a week, so in 12 weeks, there are \\( 12 \\times 7 = 84 \\) days.\n2. Claire uses 3 eggs each day, so she would use \\( 84 \\times 3 = 252 \\) eggs in total.\n3. A dozen consists of 12 eggs, so Claire would need \\( 252 \\div 12 = 21 \\) dozens of eggs.\n\nThus, the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Days**: \n   - \\(12 \\text{ weeks} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 84 \\text{ days}\\)\n\n2. **Calculate Total Eggs**:\n   - \\(84 \\text{ days} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/day} = 252 \\text{ eggs}\\)\n\n3. **Convert to Dozens**:\n   - \\(252 \\text{ eggs} \\div 12 \\text{ eggs/dozen} = 21 \\text{ dozens}\\)\n\nThe calculations have been verified step by step, ensuring accuracy in each stage. Therefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{21}\\)."
