Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

We'll use a direct Python solution for the calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Understand the Basic Rate:**\n   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one individual can paint the full house in \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) days.\n\n2. **Calculate Individual Rate:**\n   - If one person completes 1 house in 10 days, their rate is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) houses per day.\n\n3. **Team Rate:**\n   - A team of 5 people will work together. Therefore, their combined rate will be \\(5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) houses per day.\n\n4. **Calculate Time for Team to Paint Full House:**\n   - To paint 1 house, \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \\) days are needed by the team of 5 individuals at this rate.\n\n5. **Convert Days into Hours:**\n   - Since we assume an 8-hour workday, the total hours will be \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) hours for the team to paint the entire house.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Rate of one individual\nindividual_rate = Rational(1, 10)  # house per day\n\n# Rate of the team of 5 individuals\nteam_rate = 5 * individual_rate  # house per day\n\n# Days needed by the team to paint 1 house\ndays_needed = 1 / team_rate  # number of days\n\n# Total hours needed assuming an 8-hour workday\nhours_per_day = 8\ntotal_hours = days_needed * hours_per_day\n\n# Print the result in fractional form\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify Individual Work Rate:**\n   - Calculation: One person paints half a house in 5 days → Full house in 10 days → Rate is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\).\n\n2. **Verify Team Work Rate:**\n   - Calculation: 5 people with \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) rate each → Total rate is \\(\\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Verify Time for Full House:**\n   - Calculation: Time for 1 house = \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\) days.\n\n4. **Convert to Hours:**\n   - Calculation: \\(2\\) days \\(\\times 8\\) hours per day = 16 hours.\n\nAfter verifying each step, we are confident in our calculations and the final result.\n\nThe solution to the problem is that it will take a team of 5 individuals \\( \\boxed{16} \\) hours to paint the entire house."
