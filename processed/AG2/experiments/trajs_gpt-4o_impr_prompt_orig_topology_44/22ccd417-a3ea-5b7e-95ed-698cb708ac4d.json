Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses. How many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi each time?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many milliliters (mL) of one medicine are combined by Saanvi for each dose. We're given that Saanvi uses a certain amount of one medicine (let's call it \\( x \\) mL) and three times that amount of the second medicine for each dose, and there are 8 doses in total, amounting to 448 mL.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1. Define the amount of the first medicine used per dose as \\( x \\) mL.\n2. Since the second medicine is three times the first, it should be \\( 3x \\) mL.\n3. The total amount of medicine used per dose is then \\( x + 3x = 4x \\) mL.\n4. For 8 doses, the total amount of medicine is \\( 8 \\times 4x = 32x \\) mL.\n5. We know the total for 8 doses is 448 mL. So, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   32x = 448\n   \\]\n6. Solve for \\( x \\) to find the mL of one medicine used per dose.\n\nLet's compute this using Python and sympy to ensure accuracy and adherence to the solution format.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(32 * x, 448)\n\n# Solve the equation\nresult = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will solve the equation \\( 32x = 448 \\) for \\( x \\) and find the mL of one medicine per dose.\n\nLet's verify this computation in the next section.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Setup: We confirmed the problem requires finding \\( x \\) where \\( 32x = 448 \\).\n2. Calculation: Solving \\( x = \\frac{448}{32} \\) will confirm the amount per single instance.\n3. Verification: The solution should match our logical setup and the details provided (the sum totals to 448 mL for 8 doses).\n\nOnce confirmed computationally:\n\nIf the solution checks out with our logical reasoning, then our answer is correct.\n\nThe result is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]\n\nThus, Saanvi combines 14 mL of one medicine for each dose."

We started with the equation for 8 doses: \\( 32x = 448 \\).\n2. Solving for \\( x \\), we divided 448 by 32 to find that \\( x = 14 \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents the amount of one medicine used per dose, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]\n\nThis means that each dose contains 14 mL of the first medicine. We've successfully used both logical reasoning and computational verification to arrive at the correct solution."
