Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 60 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 30 different shows which were 20 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use case 1: Direct Python Solution.\n\nFirst, we note the following from the problem:\n\n1. John spends 60 hours boating.\n2. He spends half the time he spent boating on swimming. This implies he spends \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) hours swimming.\n3. He watches 30 shows, each 20 hours long, so he spends \\( 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\) hours on shows.\n4. Watching shows accounts for 30% of his total time.\n5. Sightseeing accounts for 40% of his total time.\n\nLet \\( T \\) be the total time John spent during his vacation. Since watching shows accounts for 30% of his total time:\n\n\\[ 0.3 \\times T = 600 \\]\n\nThis equation will allow us to solve for \\( T \\).\n\nNext, we'll calculate the time spent on sightseeing using \\( 0.4 \\times T \\).\n\nHere's the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the total time variable\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Equation for the time spent on shows\neq1 = Eq(0.3 * T, 600)\n\n# Solve for the total time T\ntotal_time = solve(eq1, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate the time spent sightseeing\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time\n\n# Print the time spent sightseeing\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. Calculate the total time \\( T \\) spent during his vacation using the equation \\( 0.3T = 600 \\).\n2. Verify result: \\( T = \\frac{600}{0.3} = 2000 \\) hours.\n3. Calculate the time spent sightseeing: \\( 0.4 \\times 2000 = 800 \\) hours.\n\nThe solution checks out against all conditions.\n\nThus, John spent \\(\\boxed{800}\\) hours on sightseeing."
