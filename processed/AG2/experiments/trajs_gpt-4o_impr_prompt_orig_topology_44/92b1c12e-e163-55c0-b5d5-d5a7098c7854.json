Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "To solve the problem involving the ages of Carver, his daughter, and his son, we need to set up some algebraic equations based on the information given.\n\n### Key Concepts:\nWe are dealing with algebraic expressions and equations to find the son's age based on the relationships provided between the ages of Carver, his daughter, and his son.\n\n### Let's decide the approach:\n**Case 1: Direct Python Solution.** We'll use sympy to set up and solve the equations.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. Let \\( D \\) represent the age of the daughter, and \\( S \\) represent the age of the son.\n2. Carver's current age is 45, which is 5 years younger than twice his daughter's age.\n\n    - This gives us the equation: \n      \\[\n      45 = 2D - 5\n      \\]\n\n3. The daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of the son.\n\n    - This gives us the equation:\n      \\[\n      D = 3S + 4\n      \\]\n\n### Solve the equations:\n\nWe'll solve these equations using sympy in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nD, S = symbols('D S')\n\n# Set up the equations based on the given relationships\neq1 = Eq(45, 2*D - 5)  # Carver is 5 years younger than twice his daughter's age\neq2 = Eq(D, 3*S + 4)   # Daughter is 4 years older than three times the son's age\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (D, S))\n\n# Extract the son's age\nson_age = solution[S]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(son_age)\n```\n\nThis code sets up two equations based on the relationships provided, and solves for the age of the son. Now, let's go through the solution process.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nWe'll verify the solution by:\n1. Checking the equation \\( 45 = 2D - 5 \\) with the solved value of \\( D \\).\n2. Ensuring \\( D = 3S + 4 \\) holds true with the values found for \\( D \\) and \\( S \\).\n\nIf both conditions check out, the solution is verified, and we can conclude it with confidence.\n\nBy running the provided code, we should obtain the numerical age of the son. Let's assume the calculation has been made and confirm correctness before presenting the answer confidently."

Let's make sure this makes sense by going through the verification steps:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify Carver's and Daughter's Age Equation:**\n   - We have \\( 45 = 2D - 5 \\).\n   - From the solution \\( D = 25 \\), substitute into the equation:\n     \\[\n     2(25) - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45\n     \\]\n   - This equation is satisfied, confirming the daughter's age is 25.\n\n2. **Verify Daughter's and Son's Age Equation:**\n   - We have \\( D = 3S + 4 \\).\n   - Substitute \\( D = 25 \\) and \\( S = 7 \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     25 = 3(7) + 4 = 21 + 4 = 25\n     \\]\n   - This equation is also satisfied.\n\nSince both relationships hold true with the calculated values, the solution is verified.\n\nThe age of Carver's son is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) years old."
