Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6.6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2.5 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow a step-by-step process to find the total time John spent on his activities during his vacation and determine how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n**Step 1: Express individual activity times.**\n\n1. Calculate the time spent on swimming:\n   - Time spent boating: 6.6 hours\n   - Time spent swimming: 6.6 / 2 = 3.3 hours\n\n2. Calculate the time watching shows:\n   - Each show: 2.5 hours\n   - Total time spent on shows: 3 shows × 2.5 hours/show = 7.5 hours\n\n**Step 2: Relate show time to total time.**\n\nGiven that the time spent watching shows constitutes 30% of the total time spent on activities, we can find the total time \\(T\\).\n\nLet \\(T\\) be the total time John spent on activities.\n\\[ 0.3T = 7.5 \\]\n\nSolve for \\(T\\):\n\\[ T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate sightseeing time.**\n\nGiven that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing:\n\\[ 0.4T = \\text{time spent sightseeing} \\]\n\nNow we can implement this calculation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the total time as a symbol\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Equation for the total time based on shows\nequation_for_total_time = Eq(0.3 * T, 7.5)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_time = solve(equation_for_total_time, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate the sightseeing time, which is 40% of the total time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time\n\n# Print the sightseeing time\nprint(f\"The time spent sightseeing is: {sightseeing_time} hours\")\n```\n\n**Execution of the Code:**\n\nBy running the Python code above, we'll calculate the total time John spent on his activities and how much of it was spent sightseeing.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. The total time \\(T\\) should satisfy that 30% of \\(T\\) is 7.5 hours: \\(0.3T = 7.5\\).\n2. From the equation \\(T = 25\\) hours must confirm correctness.\n3. Check if the calculation for sightseeing (40% of 25 hours) aligns with the given requirements.\n\nUpon verifying the calculations:\n\n- Total time \\(T\\) = 25 hours\n- Sightseeing time = 0.4 × 25 = 10 hours\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n\nThe final result is that John spent 10 hours sightseeing."

John spends:\n   - 6.6 hours boating.\n   - 3.3 hours swimming.\n   - 7.5 hours watching shows.\n\n2. The total time spent, 25 hours, is verified through the equation \\(0.3 \\times 25 = 7.5\\).\n\n3. The time spent sightseeing is 40% of this total time:\n   \\[ 0.4 \\times 25 = 10 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe above steps verify the conclusion. Hence, the final answer, expressed in the appropriate format, is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n\nThe time John spent sightseeing is indeed 10 hours."
