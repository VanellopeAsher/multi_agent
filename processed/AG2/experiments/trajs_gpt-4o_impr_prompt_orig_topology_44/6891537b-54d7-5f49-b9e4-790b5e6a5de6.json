Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of calculations to determine how many students Miss Maria can give her cards to. Here's how we can approach the problem systematically:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has:**\n   - Basketball cards: 6 decks with 25 cards each.\n   - Baseball cards: 5 boxes with 40 cards each.\n\n2. **Determine how many cards are kept by Miss Maria and calculate the number of cards given to students:**\n   - Miss Maria initially intends to give 10 cards to Jane, which Jane refuses.\n   - Miss Maria decides to keep 50 cards for herself.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cards each student receives and determine the number of students:**\n   - Each student receives 10 cards.\n\nLet's break down the solution using Python to compute these steps.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Calculate the total number of basketball and baseball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\n\n# Calculate the number of cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - 50  # Miss Maria keeps 50 cards\n\n# Calculate number of students\nstudents = cards_given_to_students / 10  # Each student gets 10 cards\n\n# Print the number of students\nprint(students)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We calculate the total number of basketball and baseball cards.\n- Subtracting the 50 cards Miss Maria keeps from the total gives the number of cards distributed to her students.\n- Dividing the number of distributed cards by 10 gives the number of students, since each student receives 10 cards.\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Card Calculations:**\n   - Total basketball cards = 6 * 25 = 150\n   - Total baseball cards = 5 * 40 = 200\n   - Total cards = 150 + 200 = 350\n\n2. **Cards kept and given to students:**\n   - Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, hence cards given to students = 350 - 50 = 300\n\n3. **Number of students:**\n   - Each student receives 10 cards, so 300 cards given means 300 / 10 = 30 students.\n\nThe calculation shows that Miss Maria has 30 students.\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{30}\\)"
