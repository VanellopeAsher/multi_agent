Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps:\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\nPolly has the ability to throw a gold javelin a certain distance. The dragon has a fire breath range of 10,000 feet. Without the sapphire gemstone, Polly can only throw the javelin 4,000 feet. However, when holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. We need to calculate how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon with the javelin.\n\n### Calculation\n\n1. **Distance with Sapphire Gemstone**:\n   - Without the gemstone, Polly throws 4,000 feet.\n   - With the gemstone, Polly throws 3 times that distance.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \\times 4,000 \\text{ feet} = 12,000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Position Outside Dragon's Fire Range**:\n   - If Polly can throw the javelin 12,000 feet, we need to find out how much farther that is compared to the dragon's attack range.\n   - The dragon can attack up to 10,000 feet. If Polly stands at the maximum distance of her throw (12,000 feet), she should be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance outside dragon's range} = 12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Polly can stand 2,000 feet outside of the dragon's breath range and still hit the dragon.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nWe'll confirm our solution by reviewing each step:\n\n1. Calculated throw distance with the gemstone (3 times the normal throw).\n2. Checked her throw distance against the dragon's range.\n3. Subtracted the dragon's range from Polly's throw distance to quantify the safe distance outside the range.\n\nWith the above verifications complete, the solution is validated.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2000} \\]"
