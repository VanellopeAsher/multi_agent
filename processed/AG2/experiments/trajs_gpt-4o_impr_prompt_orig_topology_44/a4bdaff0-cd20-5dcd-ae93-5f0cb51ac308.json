      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $3000/month, her credit card's minimum is $2000/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $5000/month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum required on all her debts every month.\n\nKey Information:\n- The minimum monthly payments are:\n  - Student loans: $3000\n  - Credit cards: $2000\n  - Mortgage: $5000\n\nJessica wants to pay 50% more than these minimum amounts each month.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Calculate the monthly extra amount Jessica wants to pay on each debt type by finding 50% of the minimum payments.\n2. Calculate the total monthly payment Jessica makes by adding the extra amount to the minimum amount for each debt type.\n3. Calculate the total payments for a year by multiplying the total monthly payments by 12.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Minimum monthly payments\nstudent_loans_min = 3000\ncredit_card_min = 2000\nmortgage_min = 5000\n\n# Calculate 50% extra payments\nextra_student_loans = student_loans_min * Rational(1, 2)\nextra_credit_card = credit_card_min * Rational(1, 2)\nextra_mortgage = mortgage_min * Rational(1, 2)\n\n# Total monthly payments\ntotal_monthly = (student_loans_min + extra_student_loans) + \\\n                (credit_card_min + extra_credit_card) + \\\n                (mortgage_min + extra_mortgage)\n\n# Total yearly payments\ntotal_yearly = total_monthly * 12\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_yearly)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payments:\n   - Student loans: $3000 * 0.5 = $1500\n   - Credit card: $2000 * 0.5 = $1000\n   - Mortgage: $5000 * 0.5 = $2500\n\n2. Calculate the new monthly payment with the extra amount:\n   - Student loans: $3000 + $1500 = $4500\n   - Credit card: $2000 + $1000 = $3000\n   - Mortgage: $5000 + $2500 = $7500\n\n3. Total monthly payments = $4500 + $3000 + $7500 = $15000\n\n4. Total yearly payments = $15000 * 12 = $180000\n\nFinal Calculation:\n\nBoxed result to indicate the final verified answer:\n\\(\\boxed{180000}\\)"
