Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break down the events of the day step by step and calculate the total number of brownies Greta ends up with:\n\n1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.\n2. Her office party gifted her 1/2 dozen brownies.\n3. Greta's friends had 4 dozen brownies at her surprise party.\n4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were consumed.\n\nLet's use these pieces of information to calculate the final count of brownies left.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Calculate the number of brownies Greta made initially:\n   - She made 1 dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.\n\n2. Calculate the number of brownies received from her office party:\n   - She received 1/2 dozen brownies, which equals 6 brownies.\n\n3. Calculate the number of brownies from her friends:\n   - She was given 4 dozen brownies, which equals \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) brownies.\n\n4. Total the number of brownies Greta had before any were eaten:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Brownies} = 12 (\\text{her own}) + 6 (\\text{office}) + 48 (\\text{from friends})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Brownies} = 66\n   \\]\n\n5. Subtract the number of brownies consumed during the party:\n   - 1 1/2 dozen were eaten, which equals \\(1.5 \\times 12 = 18\\) brownies.\n\n6. Calculate the number of brownies left:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brownies Left} = 66 - 18 = 48\n   \\]\n\nLet's verify the solution step by step in the VERIFICATION section:\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n- Greta's own batch: 12 brownies (1 dozen)\n- Office party brownies: 6 brownies (1/2 dozen)\n- Friends' surprise party brownies: 48 brownies (4 dozen)\n\n**Total before eating**:  \n\\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \\]\n\n**Brownies eaten during the party**:  \n\\[ 18 \\] (1 1/2 dozen)\n\n**Brownies left after eating**:  \n\\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \\]\n\nEverything checks out correctly. Therefore, Greta has 48 brownies left.\n\nFinal result: \\(\\boxed{48}\\)"
