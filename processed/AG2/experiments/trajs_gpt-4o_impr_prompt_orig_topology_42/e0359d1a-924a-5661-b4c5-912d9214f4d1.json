Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow a straightforward approach using Python to calculate how much candy each person would have after pooling and equally sharing the candies.\n\nKey Idea:\nWe will add the amounts of candy each person had initially, then divide the total by the number of people to determine the equal share for each person.\n\nStep-by-Step Process:\n1. Calculate the total amount of candy they have together.\n2. Divide the total candy by the number of people (which is 3 in this case) to find out how much each person will receive.\n\nLet's use Python to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial amounts of candy\nrobert_candy = 3\ncindy_candy = 5\naaron_candy = 4\n\n# Calculate total candy\ntotal_candy = robert_candy + cindy_candy + aaron_candy\n\n# Calculate candy per person\ncandy_per_person = Rational(total_candy, 3)\n\n# Print the result as a fraction\nprint(f\"Each person would have {candy_per_person} pounds of candy.\")\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Add Robert's, Cindy's, and Aaron's candy: \\( 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \\) pounds.\n2. Divide 12 pounds by 3 people: \\( \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\) pounds of candy per person.\n\nThe computation and reasoning confirm that each person will have 4 pounds of candy. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{4}\\)"
