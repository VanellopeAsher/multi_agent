Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money. If Walter's lawyer contributed $6600 in total, how much did his friend give him?"

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Identify Contributions**:\n   - Neighbors' Contribution: $500\n   - Online Fund Contribution: $1500\n   - Total from Neighbors and Online Fund: $500 + $1500 = $2000\n\n2. **Lawyer's Contribution**:\n   - The lawyer contributes three times the amount collected from neighbors and the online fund.\n   - Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is \\(3 \\times 2000 = 6000\\).\n\n3. **Friend's Contribution and Total Lawyer's Contribution**:\n   - According to the problem, the lawyer donated $6600 in total.\n   - We already calculated that the lawyer contributed $6000 based on others' contributions.\n   - Thus, the additional $600 comes from the friend.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the amount the friend contributed.\n\n4. **Equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lawyer's Total Contribution} = \\text{Lawyer's Base Contribution} +  \\text{Additional Contribution from Friend}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6600 = 6000 + x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = 6600 - 6000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 600\n   \\]\n\nThus, Walter's friend gave him $600.\n\nLet's present the solution using the given Python code format:\n\n```python\n# Since the calculations can be done with simple arithmetic, using sympy is not necessary here.\nfriend_contribution = 6600 - (3 * (500 + 1500))\nprint(friend_contribution)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n\n- We calculated the total contribution the lawyer would make based on the other contributions: $6000.\n- The lawyer contributed $6600 in total, which means $600 was from the friend.\n\nThe calculations check out, so the final answer is:\n\\(\\boxed{600}\\)"
