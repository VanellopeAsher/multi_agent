Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPaisley, Reggie, and Lynn went for a run. Paisley covered a distance of 4 miles. Reggie ran a distance that was five times the distance that Paisley ran and also 3 miles more than what Lynn ran. Can you determine the distance that Lynn ran?"

      "content": "To determine the distance that Lynn ran, let's use algebraic equations to represent the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Understand the problem and set up equations:**\n   - Paisley ran 4 miles.\n   - Reggie ran a distance that was five times Paisley's distance.\n     So, Reggie's distance \\( R = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) miles.\n   - Reggie's distance was also 3 miles more than Lynn's distance. Let's denote Lynn's distance as \\( L \\).\n   - Therefore, we have the equation: \\( R = L + 3 \\).\n\n2. **Substitute the known value of Reggie's distance into the equation:**\n   - We know that \\( R = 20 \\).\n   - Thus, substituting this into the equation: \\( 20 = L + 3 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the equation for \\( L \\):**\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate \\( L \\).\n   - \\( L = 20 - 3 \\).\n   - \\( L = 17 \\).\n\nSo, Lynn ran 17 miles.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Verify the calculations:**\n   - Paisley ran: 4 miles.\n   - Reggie ran: \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) miles.\n   - Check if Reggie's distance is three more than Lynn's calculated distance:\n     - Lynn's distance: 17 miles.\n     - Reggie's distance \\( = 17 + 3 = 20 \\).\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   The calculations confirm that Lynn ran 17 miles, aligning with the problem's conditions.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."
