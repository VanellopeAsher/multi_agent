      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is planning a birthday party and wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.

      "content": "To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy for the fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. Since the streamers will not be hung on the tree in the middle of the yard, we can ignore the tree in our calculations.\n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Length of the backyard fence = 20 feet\n- Width of the backyard fence = 15 feet\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter using these dimensions.\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (20 + 15)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's perform the calculation using Python to find the perimeter.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic computation if needed\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the dimensions of the fence\nlength = 20\nwidth = 15\n\n# Calculate the perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result using the print function as required\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we find the perimeter of the fence, which is the total length of crepe paper James needs to buy.\n\nLet's carry out the verification.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nCalculate the perimeter manually:\n- Length = 20 feet\n- Width = 15 feet\n\n\\[ \nP = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total feet of crepe paper streamers required is \\(\\boxed{70}\\)."
