Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAmora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 150 more corn chips than the number the others got. If Amora and Lainey got 700 corn chips each, how many corn chips were there altogether?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's go through the necessary steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Understand the problem**:\n   - Amora and Lainey each receive 700 corn chips.\n   - The third person, Collins, receives 150 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey.\n   - We need to find the total number of corn chips.\n\n2. **Calculate how many corn chips Collins receives**:\n   - Since Collins receives 150 more than the 700 chips that Amora and Lainey receive, we can calculate Collins' portion using a simple addition: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Collins' corn chips} = 700 + 150\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of corn chips**:\n   - Add up the corn chips received by all three people:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total corn chips} = 700 (\\text{Amora}) + 700 (\\text{Lainey}) + (700 + 150) (\\text{Collins})\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compute the total using Python**.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Using simple arithmetic to calculate the total number of corn chips\n\n# Amora's and Lainey's corn chips\nchips_amora_lainey = 700\n\n# Collins gets 150 more\nchips_collins = chips_amora_lainey + 150\n\n# Total number of corn chips\ntotal_chips = chips_amora_lainey + chips_amora_lainey + chips_collins\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_chips)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Verify Collins' corn chips**:\n   - Calculate 700 + 150 = 850. This verifies Collins gets 850 corn chips.\n\n2. **Verify total corn chips**:\n   - Calculate the sum: 700 (Amora) + 700 (Lainey) + 850 (Collins) = 2250.\n\n3. **Confirm the solution**:\n   - Check each calculation matches the problem's statement and condition. The calculations align with the problem's requirements, confirming the total count is correct.\n\nThus, the total number of corn chips is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2250}\n\\]"
