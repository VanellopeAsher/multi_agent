Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n1. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes).\n2. To solve a normal sudoku puzzle, it takes John 30 minutes.\n3. An extreme sudoku puzzle takes John 3 times longer than a normal sudoku puzzle.\n\n**Calculate the Time for an Extreme Sudoku Puzzle:**\n\n- A normal sudoku puzzle takes 30 minutes.\n- Therefore, an extreme sudoku puzzle takes \\( 3 \\times 30 \\) minutes.\n\n**Determine How Many Bottles of Water John Consumes:**\n\n- In 30 minutes, John drinks 1 bottle of water.\n- For an extreme sudoku puzzle, calculate how many half-hour intervals occur in the time.\n\nNow, let's write Python code to compute how many bottles of water John drinks during that time using the `sympy` library for exact calculations.\n\n```python\n# Required Library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total time to solve an extreme sudoku\nnormal_time = Rational(30)\nextreme_time = 3 * normal_time\n\n# Calculate the number of bottles of water he drinks\nbottles_consumed = extreme_time / 30  # Each 30 minutes corresponds to 1 bottle\n\n# Print the number of bottles\nprint(bottles_consumed)  # Output in terms of a rational number\n```\n\n**Code Explanation:**\n\n- Import `Rational` from `sympy` to ensure precise rational number computation.\n- Compute `normal_time` as 30 minutes.\n- Multiply `normal_time` by 3 to get `extreme_time` (90 minutes).\n- Divide `extreme_time` by 30 to get the number of bottles John drinks.\n- Print the result using the `print` function.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 90 minutes.\n2. He drinks a bottle every 30 minutes.\n3. In 90 minutes, \\( 90 \\div 30 = 3 \\).\n4. The result confirms that John drinks 3 bottles of water.\n\nFinally, we present the result:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
