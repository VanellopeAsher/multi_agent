Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. Manny also signed up for a painting class that costs $30, but his parents don't care about the cost of this class.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Karate classes Manny can miss before the cost per attended class exceeds $10. Let's use a step-by-step approach to break down the problem:\n\n### Step-by-step Process\n\n1. **Initial Parameters:**\n   - Total cost of Karate classes: $60\n   - Total number of Karate classes: 10\n   - Maximum acceptable cost per class: $10\n\n2. **Formulate the cost per attended class:**\n   - Let \\( a \\) be the number of classes attended by Manny.\n   - The cost per attended class would then be \\( \\frac{60}{a} \\).\n\n3. **Determine the condition for the cost:**\n   - We need \\( \\frac{60}{a} \\leq 10 \\).\n\n4. **Solve the inequality:**\n   - Solve for \\( a \\) in the inequality \\( \\frac{60}{a} \\leq 10 \\).\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\n# Define the symbol\na = symbols('a', positive=True)\n\n# Set up the equation\ncost_per_class = 60/a\n\n# Solve the inequality for when the cost per class is less than or equal to 10\nsolution = solve(Eq(cost_per_class, 10), a)\n\n# The solution will provide us the threshold number of classes below which Manny can't miss\nthreshold_classes = solution[0]\n\n# The maximum number of classes Manny can miss\nmax_missed_classes = 10 - threshold_classes\n\nprint(int(max_missed_classes))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use `sympy` to solve the equation \\( \\frac{60}{a} = 10 \\) which derives from \\( \\frac{60}{a} \\leq 10 \\).\n- The variable \\( a \\) represents the number of classes Manny must attend to meet the cost condition.\n- By subtracting \\( a \\) from 10, we determine how many classes Manny can miss.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the solution**:\n    - Solved \\( \\frac{60}{a} = 10 \\) which gives \\( a = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Interpret the result**:\n    - Manny must attend at least 6 classes. Therefore, he can miss up to \\( 10 - 6 = 4 \\) classes.\n\nBased on the analysis, the maximum number of Karate classes Manny can miss is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
