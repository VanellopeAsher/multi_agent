Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents, how many cents will she have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has, the total amount she spends, and then find out how much she has left.\n\n### Key Idea:\nKelly owns 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Quarters and dimes are both specific coins worth a certain number of cents. We need the total value of these coins in cents. Then, subtract the total expenditure (55 cents for a pop and 45 cents for a candy bar) from her total amount.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Calculate the total money Kelly has:**\n   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents.\n   - Each dime is worth 10 cents.\n   - Total value from quarters: \\(5 \\times 25\\) cents\n   - Total value from dimes: \\(2 \\times 10\\) cents\n\n2. **Calculate total expenses:**\n   - Cost of the can of pop: 55 cents.\n   - Cost of the candy bar: 45 cents.\n   - Total spent: \\(55 + 45\\) cents\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining amount:**\n   - Subtract the total expenses from the total amount of money she has.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Python code to compute the remaining amount\n\n# Total value from quarters\nquarters_value = 5 * 25\n\n# Total value from dimes\ndimes_value = 2 * 10\n\n# Total money Kelly has\ntotal_money = quarters_value + dimes_value\n\n# Total expenses\ntotal_expenses = 55 + 45\n\n# Money left after purchases\nremaining_money = total_money - total_expenses\n\n# Display the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- Kelly has 5 quarters: \\(5 \\times 25 = 125\\) cents.\n- Kelly has 2 dimes: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) cents.\n- Total money Kelly initially has = \\(125 + 20 = 145\\) cents.\n- Total expenditure = \\(55 + 45 = 100\\) cents.\n- Money left after purchases = \\(145 - 100 = 45\\) cents.\n\nThe calculations align with our plan, and the values check out.\n\nThe final remaining amount is \\(\\boxed{45}\\) cents."
