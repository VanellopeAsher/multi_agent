  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of making each jar of the mixture and then determine the overall profit from selling multiple jars. Let's work through the steps to find the solution.\n\n### Key Idea\n1. **Calculate the Cost Per Jar**: We'll determine the cost of the ingredients used in one jar.\n2. **Profit Calculation**: We'll calculate the total profit when selling a specific number of jars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n**Step 1**: Calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar:\n- Passion fruit: \\(2 \\, \\text{pounds} \\times 6 \\, \\frac{\\text{dollars}}{\\text{pound}} = 12 \\, \\text{dollars}\\)\n- Jackfruit: \\(1.5 \\, \\text{pounds} \\times 8 \\, \\frac{\\text{dollars}}{\\text{pound}} = 12 \\, \\text{dollars}\\)\n- Honey: \\(2 \\, \\text{pounds} \\times 10 \\, \\frac{\\text{dollars}}{\\text{pound}} = 20 \\, \\text{dollars}\\)\n\nTotal cost for ingredients per jar = \\(12 + 12 + 20 = 44\\) dollars.\n\n**Step 2**: Calculate the selling price per jar.\n- Selling price per jar = $50\n\n**Step 3**: Determine the profit per jar.\n- Profit per jar = Selling price - Cost of ingredients = \\(50 - 44 = 6\\) dollars.\n\n**Step 4**: Calculate the total profit from selling 10 jars.\n- Total profit = Profit per jar \\(\\times\\) Number of jars sold\n- Total profit = \\(6 \\, \\text{dollars/jar} \\times 10 \\, \\text{jars} = 60\\) dollars.\n\nLet's verify this solution step by step:\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Cost Calculation**:\n   - The individual costs add up correctly (12 + 12 + 20 = 44).\n\n2. **Profit Calculation**:\n   - The profit per jar computed as 6 dollars matches the selling price (50) minus the cost (44), which is accurate.\n\n3. **Total Profit Calculation**:\n   - The total profit from 10 jars calculated as 60 dollars matches profit per jar (6) times number of jars (10).\n\nThis verification confirms our calculations are accurate, and the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
