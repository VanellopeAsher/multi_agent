Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. If they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that amount on Friday, how many chimichangas do they make on Tuesday?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, given the constraints provided. \n\n**Key Idea:**\n- We have a fixed total production of 500 chimichangas across three days: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.\n- The production on Tuesday and Wednesday is the same.\n- The production on Friday is twice that of Tuesday.\n\nLet's define the problem with variable representation:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n- Therefore, \\( x \\) is also the number made on Wednesday.\n- On Friday, they make \\( 2x \\) chimichangas.\n\nThe equation representing the total production is:\n\\[ x + x + 2x = 500 \\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n1. Simplify the equation: Combine like terms.\n2. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(x + x + 2*x, 500)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nNow, let's verify our solution:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. We derived the equation: \\( x + x + 2x = 500 \\).\n2. Simplified, this becomes: \\( 4x = 500 \\).\n3. Solving for \\( x \\) gives \\( x = \\frac{500}{4} \\).\n4. Performing the division yields \\( x = 125 \\).\n\nThus, the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday is \\(\\boxed{125}\\)."
