Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to sum the ages of all the siblings in the family. Let's go through the steps needed to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the Ages of the Siblings:**\n   - We have 2 brothers and 10 sisters.\n   - Each sister is 16 years old.\n   - One brother is 12 years old.\n   - The 12-year-old brother is half the age of the older brother. Thus, the age of the older brother is \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Age:**\n   - Total age of sisters: \\(10 \\times 16 = 160\\)\n   - Total age of brothers: \\(12 + 24 = 36\\)\n   - Therefore, the total age of all siblings is \\(160 + 36\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define ages\nsisters_age = 16\nnumber_of_sisters = 10\nyounger_brother_age = 12\nolder_brother_age = younger_brother_age * 2\n\n# Calculate total age of sisters and brothers\ntotal_sisters_age = sisters_age * number_of_sisters\ntotal_brothers_age = younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\n# Calculate total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_sisters_age + total_brothers_age\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify Individual Calculations:**\n   - Total age for the sisters: \\(10 \\times 16 = 160\\).\n   - Age of the older brother: \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n   - Total age for the brothers: \\(12 + 24 = 36\\).\n\n2. **Verify Final Calculation:**\n   - Total age of all siblings: \\(160 + 36 = 196\\).\n\nThe calculations match the expected values, confirming the correctness.\n\n\\(\\boxed{196}\\)"

To reiterate the solution clearly:\n\nWe are given:\n- There are 10 sisters, each 16 years old.\n- One brother is 12 years old.\n- The other brother is twice as old as the 12-year-old brother, making him 24 years old.\n\nLet's compute once more:\n\n1. **Total Age of the Sisters:**\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 16 = 160 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Age of the Brothers:**\n   \\[\n   12 + 24 = 36 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Age of All Siblings:**\n   \\[\n   160 + 36 = 196 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total age of all the siblings in the family is \\(\\boxed{196}\\)."
