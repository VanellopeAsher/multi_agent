Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow a structured approach using Python and algebra.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Identify Variables and Relationships:**\n    - Let the number of small stuffed animals sold be \\(s\\).\n    - Let the number of large stuffed animals sold be \\(l\\).\n\n2. **Formulate Equations:**\n    - The problem states that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. Since each small stuffed animal costs $40, each large stuffed animal costs \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\) dollars.\n    - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\(s = 2l\\).\n    - The total revenue is $1200. Thus, the equation for the total revenue is \\(40s + 120l = 1200\\).\n\n3. **Substitute and Solve:**\n    - Substitute \\(s = 2l\\) into the total revenue equation:\n      \\[\n      40(2l) + 120l = 1200\n      \\]\n\n4. **Continue with Calculations:**\n    - Simplify the equation:\n      \\[\n      80l + 120l = 1200\n      \\]\n      \\[\n      200l = 1200\n      \\]\n    - Divide both sides by 200 to solve for \\(l\\):\n      \\[\n      l = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n      \\]\n    - Use \\(s = 2l\\) to find \\(s\\):\n      \\[\n      s = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n      \\]\n\n5. **Verification:**\n    - Calculate the revenue from the small stuffed animals: \\(40 \\times 12 = 480\\) dollars.\n    - Calculate the revenue from the large stuffed animals: \\(120 \\times 6 = 720\\) dollars.\n    - Total revenue is \\(480 + 720 = 1200\\) dollars, which matches the given total.\n\nNow, let's present the solution using the specified Python format:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define variables\ns, l = symbols('s l')\n\n# Formulate the equations based on the problem description\nequation1 = s - 2*l # s = 2l\nequation2 = 40*s + 120*l - 1200 # 40s + 120l = 1200\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (s, l))\n\n# Print the number of small stuffed animals sold\nprint(solution[s])\n```\n\nThis code will solve the problem and print the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n\nAfter verifying the steps and calculations, the final result is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
