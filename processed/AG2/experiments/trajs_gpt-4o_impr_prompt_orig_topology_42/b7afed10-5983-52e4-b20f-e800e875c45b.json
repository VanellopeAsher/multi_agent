Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSam ran 3.5 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5.5 miles.  How many miles did Sam run this week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use Python to compute the total number of miles Sam ran throughout the week.\n\nConsidering the problem statement:\n- Sam ran 3.5 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\n- Sam ran 5.5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nWe'll calculate the total miles using these values.\n\nLet's construct the Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the miles run on each day\nmonday_wednesday_friday_miles = 3.5\ntuesday_thursday_miles = 5.5\n\n# Calculate total miles for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (3 days)\ntotal_mwf = 3 * monday_wednesday_friday_miles\n\n# Calculate total miles for Tuesday and Thursday (2 days)\ntotal_tt = 2 * tuesday_thursday_miles\n\n# Calculate the overall total miles\ntotal_miles = total_mwf + total_tt\n\n# Import sympy to express the result as a fraction\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Convert total miles to a fraction to preserve the non-decimal format\ntotal_miles_fraction = Rational(total_miles).limit_denominator()\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_miles_fraction)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. We define the number of miles run on each specific day.\n2. We calculate the total miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday combined.\n3. We calculate the total miles run on Tuesday and Thursday combined.\n4. We sum these totals to get the weekly mileage.\n5. We use the sympy library to express the total in a fraction form to adhere to our output requirement.\n6. Finally, we print the result.\n\n### Verification\nLet's verify our calculation step by step:\n- Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: \\(3 \\times 3.5 = 10.5\\) miles\n- Tuesday and Thursday: \\(2 \\times 5.5 = 11\\) miles\n- Total miles: \\(10.5 + 11 = 21.5\\) miles\n\nThe answer in fraction form is \\(\\frac{43}{2}\\).\n\n\nBy running the provided code, we should expect the output to show:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{43}{2}} \\]\n\nThis matches our verification calculation, confirming the total number of miles Sam ran during the week."
