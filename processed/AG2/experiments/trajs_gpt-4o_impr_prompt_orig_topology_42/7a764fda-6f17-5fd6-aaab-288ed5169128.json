Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn November, a toy was $4000. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to apply a sequential set of percentage changes to the price of the toy. Let's use Python along with the sympy library to calculate the final price step by step, ensuring we adhere to the specified format.\n\n### Key Idea:\nTo determine the price of the toy after the specified changes:\n1. Compute the increased price after the 80% hike in December.\n2. Calculate the new price after a 50% decrease in January.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using Python and sympy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational\n\n# Original price in November\noriginal_price = 4000\n\n# Increase by 80% in December\nincreased_price = original_price * (1 + Rational(80, 100))\n\n# Decrease by 50% in January\nfinal_price = increased_price * (1 - Rational(50, 100))\n\n# Print the final price in a fraction\nprint(final_price)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Increase in December:** The price increased by 80%, so the new price is \\( 4000 \\times (1 + \\frac{80}{100}) \\).\n2. **Decrease in January:** The increased price decreases by 50%, hence the final price is \\( \\text{(New Price)} \\times (1 - \\frac{50}{100}) \\).\n\nExecuting this code will provide us with the final price after the January discount.\n\nLet's check the output:\n\n```python\n# Execute the code\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational\n\n# Original price in November\noriginal_price = 4000\n\n# Increase by 80% in December\nincreased_price = original_price * (1 + Rational(80, 100))\n\n# Decrease by 50% in January\nfinal_price = increased_price * (1 - Rational(50, 100))\n\n# Print the final price in a fraction form\nprint(final_price)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Calculate price after December increase:**\n   \\[\n   4000 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{80}{100}\\right) = 4000 \\times 1.8 = 7200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate price after January decrease:**\n   \\[\n   7200 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{50}{100}\\right) = 7200 \\times 0.5 = 3600\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final price of the toy after the January discount is \\$3600.\n\nFinally, the answer is \\(\\boxed{3600}\\)."
