Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, the key concept involves understanding and applying the concept of direct proportionality. Specifically, we need to determine how many hash browns can be made from a different number of potatoes while maintaining the same ratio.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Identify the Given Ratio:**\n   - From the problem, we know that 60 potatoes make 360 hash browns.\n   - So, the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is \\( \\frac{360 \\text{ hash browns}}{60 \\text{ potatoes}} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Hash Browns per Potato:**\n   - Calculate how many hash browns one potato can yield:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Hash browns per potato} = \\frac{360}{60}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Hash Browns for 960 Potatoes:**\n   - Use the value from Step 2 to calculate hash browns for 960 potatoes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Hash browns} = \\text{Hash browns per potato} \\times 960\n     \\]\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\npotatoes = 60\nhash_browns = 360\n\n# Calculate the number of hash browns per potato\nhash_browns_per_potato = Rational(hash_browns, potatoes)\n\n# Number of potatoes we have\npotatoes_new = 960\n\n# Calculate the number of hash browns for 960 potatoes\nhash_browns_new = hash_browns_per_potato * potatoes_new\n\n# Print the result using sympy to keep it in fraction form if needed\nprint(hash_browns_new)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Hash Browns per Potato:**\n   - Calculate: \\( \\frac{360}{60} = 6 \\) hash browns per potato.\n\n2. **Hash Browns for 960 Potatoes:**\n   - Using the rate of 6 hash browns per potato for 960 potatoes:\n   - \\( 6 \\times 960 = 5760 \\) hash browns.\n\nTherefore, by implementing these calculations, we find that you can make 5760 hash browns from 960 potatoes.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5760} \\]"

      "content": "Yes, that is correct. You can make 5760 hash browns from 960 potatoes. The calculations confirm this result:\n\nStarting from the given ratio of 60 potatoes making 360 hash browns, we determine that each potato yields 6 hash browns. Thus, with 960 potatoes, you can indeed produce \\(960 \\times 6 = 5760\\) hash browns.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5760} \\]"
