Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of performing arithmetic operations to calculate the total expenditure made by Mrs. Rylan on purchasing seeds. We'll use a Direct Python Solution (Case 1) to determine the total cost.\n\nHere is the plan:\n- Using the information provided:\n  - Number of tomato seed packets: 20\n  - Price per tomato seed packet: $40\n  - Number of celery seed packets: 80\n  - Price per celery seed packet: $30\n  \n- We'll calculate the total cost for each type of seed packet and then sum up the costs to find the total expenditure.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number and price of seed packets\ntomato_packets = 20\nprice_per_tomato_packet = 40\n\ncelery_packets = 80\nprice_per_celery_packet = 30\n\n# Calculate total cost for each type\ntotal_cost_tomato = tomato_packets * price_per_tomato_packet\ntotal_cost_celery = celery_packets * price_per_celery_packet\n\n# Total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = total_cost_tomato + total_cost_celery\n\n# Print the result in a friendly format\nprint(\"The total amount of money spent on purchasing seeds is $\", total_expenditure)\n```\n\nNow, let's proceed with the calculation.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of tomato seed packets:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for tomatoes} = 20 \\times 40 = 800\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of celery seed packets:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for celery} = 80 \\times 30 = 2400\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total expenditure:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expenditure} = 800 + 2400 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n4. **The calculations show that the total expenditure is $3200.**\n\nTherefore, the verified total expenditure made by Mrs. Rylan is \\(\\boxed{3200}\\)."
