Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLast night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to go through it systematically. We'll set up some equations based on the problem statement and solve them using Python.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n\n1. **Variables**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of cougars Rick killed last night.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the number of cougars Rick killed today.\n   - The number of wolves Rick killed last night is given as 10.\n   - The number of wolves Rick killed today is \\( 3y \\) (three times as many wolves as cougars today).\n\n2. **Equations from the problem**:\n   - From \"three fewer cougars than the previous night\", we have:\n     \\[\n     y = x - 3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total animals killed**:\n   - Last night, total animals \\( = 10 + x \\).\n   - Today, total animals \\( = 3y + y = 4y \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is:\n\\[\n(10 + x) + (3y + y) = 10 + x + 4y\n\\]\n\nSince we know that \\( y = x - 3 \\), we substitute \\( y \\) in the total:\n\\[\n10 + x + 4(x - 3)\n\\]\n\nLet's put this into Python to find the total number of animals Rick killed.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation using our substitution y = x - 3\ntotal_animals = 10 + x + 4 * (x - 3)\n\n# Simplify the expression for the total number of animals\ntotal_animals = total_animals.expand()\n\n# Print the total number of animals\nprint(total_animals)\n```\nLet's execute the above code to get the result. \n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Substitution**:\n   - \\( y = x - 3 \\) is used to express the number of cougars today in terms of last night's count.\n\n2. **Counting wolves today**:\n   - Given \\( y \\), wolves were \\( 3y \\).\n\n3. **Expression for Today's total**:\n   - \\( y + 3y = 4y = 4(x - 3) \\) substitutes directly into the main equation for verification.\n\n4. **Total equation**:\n   - Simplify: \\( 10 + x + 4(x - 3) \\).\n\nFinally, after ensuring our substitution and simplification, if our symbolic equation matches, we validate the solution numerically to find the value:\n\n\\[ \n10 + x + 4(x - 3) = \\text{{expression}}\n\\]\n\nUpon running the Python code, we realize:\n- The symbolic equation will compute and return the final result, confirming how many animals Rick killed overall, including during both nights.\n\nThe final mathematical computation reveals the outcome that we encapsulate.\n"
