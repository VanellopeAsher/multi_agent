Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $300 every day. He worked for an entire week and spent a total of $1000. How much does he have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald has left after working for a week and spending a certain amount. Let's go through this step by step.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n- **Income Calculation**: Gerald earns $300 per day.\n- **Number of Days in a Week**: Gerald works 7 days a week.\n- **Total Earnings Calculation**: Multiply the daily earning by the number of days worked.\n- **Spending**: Subtract the total amount spent from the total earnings to find out how much money Gerald has left.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings for the week:\n   - Daily earnings = $300\n   - Number of workdays in a week = 7\n   - Total earnings = Daily earnings × Number of days in a week = 300 × 7\n\n2. Subtract the amount spent from the total earnings:\n   - Total spent = $1000\n   - Remaining money = Total earnings - Total spent\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the daily earnings and number of workdays\ndaily_earnings = 300\nwork_days = 7\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = daily_earnings * work_days\n\n# Total amount spent\ntotal_spent = 1000\n\n# Calculate remaining money\nremaining_money = total_earnings - total_spent\n\n# Print the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Income Verification**:\n   - Daily earning = $300\n   - Number of days worked = 7\n   - Total earnings should be $300 × 7 = $2100\n\n2. **Spending and Remaining Verification**:\n   - Total earnings = $2100\n   - Total spent = $1000\n   - Remaining money should be $2100 - $1000 = $1100\n\nLet's run the code to verify the solution.\n\nThe final result is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{1100}\\)"
