Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class.

      "content": "To solve this problem and determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of the test scores he received. Let's use Python with the `sympy` library to keep our calculations in line with the query requirements.\n\nHereâ€™s how we can calculate the average:\n\n### Key Idea\nTo find the average of the five test scores, we add them together and divide by the number of scores, which is 5.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. List Wilson's test scores: \\(70, 95, 88, 90, 78\\).\n2. Calculate the sum of the scores.\n3. Divide the sum by 5 to find the average score.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Wilson's test scores\nscores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the test scores\nsum_scores = sum(scores)\n\n# Calculate the average using the Rational class to maintain the fraction format\naverage_score = Rational(sum_scores, len(scores))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Wison's current math grade is: {average_score}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. Calculate the sum of the scores: \\(70 + 95 + 88 + 90 + 78 = 421\\).\n2. Compute the average: \\(\\frac{421}{5} = 84.2\\), which can be represented as a fraction: \\(\\frac{421}{5}\\).\n\nUpon reviewing the calculations, Wilson's current math grade is the result of the average of these scores.\n\n### Final Result\nAs per our calculations:\n\\[ \\boxed{84.2} \\]\n\nWilson's current math grade is 84.2, which we can see from evaluating \\(\\frac{421}{5}\\). Since 84.2 is not 85 or higher, Wilson does not meet the requirement for the car as per the grade criterion."

Let's evaluate this fraction to verify the result.\n\n\\[ \\frac{421}{5} = 84.2 \\]\n\nThis means that Wilson's current math grade is indeed 84.2. Therefore, presented in fraction form, the result would be:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{421}{5}} \\]\n\nWilson's current grade of 84.2 does not meet the requirement of being 85 or higher."
