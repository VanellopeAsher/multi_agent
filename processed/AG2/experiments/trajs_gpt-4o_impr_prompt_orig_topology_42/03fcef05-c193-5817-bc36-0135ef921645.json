Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRaymond initially had $2100. Then he saved $1100 from his allowance and spent $500 on a comic book and $1900 on a puzzle. How much money does Raymond have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate Raymond's total money after his expenditures. We can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Raymond's initial total money by adding his savings to the initial amount.\n2. Subtract his expenditures (comic book and puzzle) from this total.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Amount of money Raymond initially had\ninitial_amount = 2100\n\n# Amount saved from allowance\nsavings = 1100\n\n# Cost of the comic book\ncomic_book_cost = 500\n\n# Cost of the puzzle\npuzzle_cost = 1900\n\n# Total money after adding savings\ntotal_money = initial_amount + savings\n\n# Money left after spending on comic book and puzzle\nmoney_left = total_money - comic_book_cost - puzzle_cost\n\n# Print the result\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute and verify the calculations:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Initial Total Money:**  \n   \\( 2100 + 1100 = 3200 \\)\n\n2. **Total Expenditures:**  \n   \\( 500 + 1900 = 2400 \\)\n\n3. **Money Left:**  \n   \\( 3200 - 2400 = 800 \\)\n\nThe calculations confirm that the final amount of money Raymond has left is correct.\n\nHence, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{800}\n\\]"
