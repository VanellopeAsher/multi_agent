Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGeorge needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000.5. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much George needs to work at his hourly wage in order to cover the total cost of his dental work after considering his deposit. The problem can be solved directly using Python code for the calculations.\n\n### Steps to solve the problem:\n1. Calculate the total cost for both implants.\n2. Subtract the deposit from the total cost to get the remaining amount George needs to pay.\n3. Calculate the number of hours he needs to work to make up the remaining amount, given his hourly wage.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols, solve, Eq\n\n# Define the base price of each implant\nbase_price_per_implant = Rational(2000.5)  # $2000.5 per implant\n\n# Cost for one implant with additional porcelain crown\nextra_cost_for_crown = Rational(500.5)  # $500.5 for the porcelain crown\n\n# Deposit amount already paid\ndeposit = Rational(600)  # $600\n\n# George's hourly wage\nhourly_wage = Rational(15.3)  # $15.3 per hour\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = 2 * base_price_per_implant + extra_cost_for_crown\n\n# Remaining amount to be paid after deposit\nremaining_amount = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Setup an equation to solve for hours needed to work\nhours = symbols('hours')  # Symbol for the number of hours\nequation = Eq(remaining_amount, hourly_wage * hours)\n\n# Solve for the number of hours needed\nhours_needed = solve(equation, hours)[0]\n\n# Display the result\nprint(hours_needed)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We use `Rational` from the `sympy` library to ensure that we are dealing with exact values rather than floating-point approximations.\n- We calculate the `total_cost` by summing the cost of two implants and adding the extra cost for the porcelain crown for one implant.\n- We calculate the `remaining_amount` that George needs to cover, after accounting for his $600 deposit.\n- Using the `Eq` and `solve` functions from `sympy`, we set up and solve an equation to find how many hours George needs to work. The left-hand side of the equation is the remaining amount, and the right-hand side is the product of his hourly wage and the number of hours.\n\n### Verification\n1. Verify the cost for the implants: \\((2 \\times 2000.5) + 500.5 = 4501.5\\).\n2. Verify the remaining amount after the deposit: \\(4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5\\).\n3. Verify the solution of the equation: \\(3901.5 = 15.3 \\times \\text{hours}\\).\n  \nOnce verified, George needs to work 255 hours to cover his remaining costs:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{255}\n\\]"
