Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost. If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, how much was the total cost?"

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we need to first understand how the cost savings relate to the overall expenses. Let's use a straightforward approach to set up and solve the problem as long as we have sufficient information.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe know that Ethan saved 20% on his project, which implies that the remaining cost (80%) is what he actually spent. However, to calculate the total cost, we need to know the original total cost prior to savings or have additional information about either the original total or the actual amount spent.\n\n**Note: The problem appears to lack specific financial details relating to the costs. Without knowing either the original cost or the actual amount spent after savings, the problem can't be solved directly. Hence, let's follow up with the handling missing data approach.**\n\nHere is how a Python script might be formatted if we had more data, but given its absence, we conclude:\n\n```python\n# Since we're missing vital information and cannot compute the total cost, return None.\nresult = None\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's verify the absence of enough informative data:\n1. Inputs: Cost savings percentage (20%), no original or final cost provided.\n2. Required: Either original or actual cost needed to compute the total.\n3. Conclusion: Missing essential information.\n\nFinal Answer: \boxed{'None'}"
