Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees compared to Joanne. We'll break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\n### Step-by-step Process\n\n1. **Calculate Joanne's Apple Gatherings:**\n   - Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.\n   - From the shortest trees, she gathers half that amount: \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\) apples.\n   - She gathers 350 apples from the average trees.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Apples Joanne Gathers:**\n   - Total for Joanne = 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + 350 (average)\n\n3. **Express Sister's Apple Gatherings:**\n   - Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne: \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\) apples.\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.\n   - She gathers no apples from the average trees.\n\n4. **Express the Combined Total of Apples:**\n   - The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   30 + 15 + 350 + 60 + x = 500\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Simplify the equation: \\( 455 + x = 500 \\)\n   - Solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 500 - 455 = 45 \\)\n\n6. **Calculate the Ratio:**\n   - Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees while Joanne gathered 15.\n   - The ratio of apples gathered by Joanne's sister to those gathered by Joanne from the shortest trees is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{45}{15} = 3\n   \\]\n\nJoanne's sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne.\n\n### Verification\n\nVerify each step to ensure calculations are accurate:\n- Confirm Joanne's total: \\( 30 + 15 + 350 = 395 \\).\n- Combine this with sister’s apples from the tallest trees and recalculated shortest trees: \\( 395 + 60 + 45 = 500 \\).\n- Confirm the ratio calculation: \\( \\frac{45}{15} = 3 \\).\n\nAfter verifying the calculations, the answer is confirmed as \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."
