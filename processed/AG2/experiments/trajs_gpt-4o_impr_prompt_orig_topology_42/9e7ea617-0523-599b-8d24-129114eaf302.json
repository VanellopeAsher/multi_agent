Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 60 feet, and the second tree has a height of 50 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined.

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we'll adopt a step-by-step mathematical approach. It involves using basic arithmetic operations to find the height of the tallest tree.\n\n### Key Concept\nThe core idea here involves calculating the height of each tree based on given information and determining the height of the tallest tree.\n\n### Solution Steps\n1. Calculate the height of the second tree.\n2. Determine the sum of the heights of the shortest and the second tree.\n3. Use this sum to calculate the height of the tallest tree.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n1. **Height of the Shortest Tree:**\n   - \\( a = 60 \\) feet\n\n2. **Height of the Second Tree:**\n   - The second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest tree.\n   - Therefore, \\( b = a + 50 \\).\n\n3. **Sum of the Shortest and the Second Tree:**\n   - Total height of the first two trees = \\( a + b \\).\n\n4. **Height of the Tallest Tree:**\n   - The tallest tree's height is twice the combined height of the shortest and second tree.\n   - Thus, Height of the tallest tree = \\( 2(a + b) \\).\n\nNow, let's use Python to calculate these values.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the height of the shortest tree\na = 60\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the height of the second tree\nb = a + 50\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the sum of the shortest and the second tree\nsum_of_two_trees = a + b\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the height of the tallest tree\ntallest_tree_height = 2 * sum_of_two_trees\n\n# Output the height of the tallest tree\nprint(tallest_tree_height)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n- **Shortest tree height:** 60 feet\n- **Second tree height** (60 + 50): 110 feet\n- **Combined height** of the first two trees: 60 + 110 = 170 feet\n- **Tallest tree height:** \\( 2 \\times 170 = 340 \\) feet\n\nThus, the height of the tallest tree is correctly calculated as \\( \\boxed{340} \\) feet."
