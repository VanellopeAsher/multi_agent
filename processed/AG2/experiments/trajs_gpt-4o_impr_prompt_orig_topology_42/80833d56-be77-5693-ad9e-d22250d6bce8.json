Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 100 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine John's running speed in miles per hour. The key idea is to divide the total distance John covers each week by the total time he spends running.\n\nLet's break the problem down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Running Time per Week:**\n   - John runs for 10 hours on the first day.\n   - He runs half as much on each of the other two days which is \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) hours per day.\n   - Thus, total running hours per week \\( = 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Determine John's Weekly Mileage:**\n   - John runs a total of 100 miles per week.\n\n3. **Compute John's Running Speed:**\n   - To find his running speed, divide the total distance by the total time.\n\nUsing these steps, we can write a Python script to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary libraries\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\ntotal_miles_per_week = 100\nhours_first_day = 10\nhours_other_days = hours_first_day / 2\ntotal_hours_per_week = hours_first_day + 2 * hours_other_days\n\n# Calculate speed\nspeed = Rational(total_miles_per_week, total_hours_per_week)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f'John runs at a speed of {speed} miles per hour.')\n```\n\nLet's verify the steps:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- **Total running time per week**: \\(10 + 5 + 5 = 20\\) hours. This matches our breakdown.\n- **Weekly distance**: 100 miles, as stated in the problem.\n- **Speed Calculation**: \\( \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{20 \\text{ hours}} = 5 \\text{ miles per hour} \\).\n  \nAll verification steps confirm our calculations. Therefore, the answer is correct:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
