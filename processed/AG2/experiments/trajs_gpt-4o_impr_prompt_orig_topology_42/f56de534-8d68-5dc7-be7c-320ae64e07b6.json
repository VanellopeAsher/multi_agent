Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces, and anther one that had 125 pieces than the 500 piece one.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up from the floor. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Pieces in Each Set**:\n   - First set: 500 pieces (already given)\n   - Second set: 3 times more pieces than the first set = \\(3 \\times 500\\)\n   - Third set: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the first set = \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 500\\)\n   - Fourth set: 125 pieces more than the first set = \\(500 + 125\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Pieces in Each Set**.\n\n3. **Sum the Total Number of Pieces**.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the specified format:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, Symbol\n\n# Calculate each set's number of pieces\nfirst_set_pieces = 500\nsecond_set_pieces = 3 * first_set_pieces\nthird_set_pieces = Rational(1, 4) * first_set_pieces\nfourth_set_pieces = first_set_pieces + 125\n\n# Calculate total pieces\ntotal_pieces = first_set_pieces + second_set_pieces + third_set_pieces + fourth_set_pieces\n\n# Use sympy to handle fractions correctly and print the result\nprint(total_pieces)\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nNow, let's verify the calculations step-by-step to ensure correctness:\n\n1. **Calculate Individual Set Pieces**:\n   - Second set: \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\)\n   - Third set: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125\\)\n   - Fourth set: \\(500 + 125 = 625\\)\n\n2. **Sum the Values**:\n   - Total pieces = \\(500 + 1500 + 125 + 625\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Total**:\n   - Total pieces = 2750\n\nBy verifying each calculation step-by-step, our understanding and solution are consistent. Thus, Johnny picks up a total of \\(\\boxed{2750}\\) pieces."
