Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags the trader sold to achieve a total profit of $400. Let's break this down step by step and implement it in Python using the correct approach.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify Variables and Equations**:  \n   Let's define:\n   - \\( n \\) as the number of bags the trader sold.\n   - The cost to buy each bag is $20.\n   - The cost to transport each bag is $2.\n   - The selling price per bag is $30.\n   - Total profit made is $400.\n\n2. **Cost and Revenue Calculations**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = n \\times (\\text{Cost per bag} + \\text{Transport cost per bag})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = n \\times (20 + 2) = 22n\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = n \\times 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Profit Equation**:  \n   Profit is defined as total revenue minus total costs. Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   400 = 30n - 22n\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( n \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   400 = 8n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{400}{8} = 50\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python using the `sympy` library to ensure accurate symbolic computation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\ncost_per_bag = 20\ntransport_cost_per_bag = 2\nselling_price_per_bag = 30\nprofit = 400\n\n# Total cost and total revenue\ntotal_cost = n * (cost_per_bag + transport_cost_per_bag)\ntotal_revenue = n * selling_price_per_bag\n\n# Equation for profit\nprofit_equation = Eq(total_revenue - total_cost, profit)\n\n# Solve the equation\nbags_sold = solve(profit_equation, n)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The number of bags sold is: {bags_sold}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. **Calculate Total Cost for 50 bags**:  \n   Total Cost = \\( 50 \\times 22 = 1100 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate Total Revenue for 50 bags**:  \n   Total Revenue = \\( 50 \\times 30 = 1500 \\)\n\n3. **Calculate Profit**:  \n   Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = \\( 1500 - 1100 = 400 \\), which matches the given profit.\n\nThus, the solution is verified. The number of bags sold is \\( \\boxed{50} \\)."
