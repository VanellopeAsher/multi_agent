Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in the month of February. The key point is to interpret the phrase \"2.8 times of ten days,\" which means there are 28 days in February.\n\n### Key Idea:\nCalculate the total number of articles published by each website separately and then combine the results to find the total number of articles published in February.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n1. Calculate the total number of political and weather news articles:\n   - Average articles per day: 20\n   - Days in February: 28\n   - Total articles in February: \\( 20 \\times 28 \\)\n\n2. Calculate the total number of business news articles:\n   - Average articles per day: 10\n   - Days in February: 28\n   - Total articles in February: \\( 10 \\times 28 \\)\n\n3. Add both totals to get the combined number of articles published by both websites.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations using the sympy library for clear arithmetic representation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational\n\n# Define number of days in February using the given information\nten_days = 10\ntimes = 2.8\ndays_in_february = Rational(times) * ten_days\n\n# Calculate articles for each category\npolitical_weather_daily = 20\nbusiness_daily = 10\n\n# Total articles for February for each category\npolitical_weather_total = political_weather_daily * days_in_february\nbusiness_total = business_daily * days_in_february\n\n# Combined total articles for February\ntotal_articles_february = political_weather_total + business_total\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(total_articles_february)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. Ensure we correctly interpreted \"2.8 times of ten days\" as 28 days.\n2. Verify the arithmetic calculations:\n   - Political and weather articles: \\( 20 \\times 28 = 560 \\)\n   - Business articles: \\( 10 \\times 28 = 280 \\)\n   - Total combined: \\( 560 + 280 = 840 \\)\n3. Confirm that all steps are correctly documented and the solution is verified.\n\nThe final result, according to our calculations and verification, is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{840}\\)"
