Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home. If 30 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in a grade level, given that two-thirds of them have desktop computers, and 30 do not have desktop computers.\n\nWe can solve this problem using the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: Two-thirds of the students have desktop computers, which means the remaining one-third do not have desktop computers. We know there are 30 students who do not have desktop computers.\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation**: Let \\( x \\) be the total number of students. Since one-third of the students do not have desktop computers, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times x = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation**: We solve for \\( x \\) to find the total number of students.\n\nLet's do this step-by-step calculation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for total number of students\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(x * (1/3), 30)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\ntotal_students = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_students)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Equation Setup**: One-third of the total students do not have desktop computers, which aligns with our equation \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times x = 30 \\).\n\n2. **Calculation Check**: Solving the equation should yield the correct total number of students. Double-check the calculation:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 3 \\times 30 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Logical Consistency**: Two-thirds of 90 students will have desktop computers, confirming the statement that one-third do not, and that equals 30 students.\n\nThus, we have verified our solution, and the total number of students is \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."
