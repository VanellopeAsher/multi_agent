Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a certain moment, a river is flowing with a volume of 4000 gallons of water. Following a day of intense rainfall, the water volume at the same location in the river becomes twice as much.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the total volume of water at a specific point in the river on the third day. The solution process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Initial Volume Calculation:**  \n   Start with the initial volume of water in the river, which is 4000 gallons.\n\n2. **Volume After Rainfall:**  \n   On the second day, due to intense rainfall, the volume of water doubles. Therefore, calculate the new volume after doubling the initial volume.\n\n3. **Volume on the Third Day:**  \n   On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons is added to the river. Calculate the total volume on this day by adding the extra water to the volume obtained after the rainfall.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python with comments to demonstrate each step clearly. We'll print the result in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Import relevant library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial volume of water in the river\ninitial_volume = 4000\n\n# Volume after double the initial volume due to rainfall\nvolume_after_rainfall = 2 * initial_volume\n\n# Additional water added on the third day\nadditional_water_third_day = 6000\n\n# Total volume on the third day\ntotal_volume_third_day = volume_after_rainfall + additional_water_third_day\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Total volume of water on the third day:\", total_volume_third_day)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Initial Volume:** 4000 gallons\n\n2. **Volume After Doubling:** \\(4000 \\times 2 = 8000\\) gallons\n\n3. **Volume on the Third Day:** Add 6000 gallons to the volume after doubling:  \n   \\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \\] gallons\n\nWith the verification steps confirming the calculations, we conclude that the total volume of water on the third day is \\(\\boxed{14000}\\) gallons."
