      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of sports cards Miss Maria has and then find the number of students based on how many cards each student received.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Number of Basketball Cards:**\n\n   Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards each. \n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Basketball Cards} = 6 \\times 25\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Number of Baseball Cards:**\n\n   Miss Maria has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards each.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Baseball Cards} = 5 \\times 40\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Number of Cards:**\n\n   Add the above to Miss Maria's special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cards} = \\text{Total Basketball Cards} + \\text{Total Baseball Cards} + 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Number of Cards Given to Students:**\n\n   Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Given to Students} = \\text{Total Cards} - 50\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine Number of Students:**\n\n   Each student gets 10 cards. Therefore, divide the number of cards given to students by 10.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Students} = \\frac{\\text{Given to Students}}{10}\n   \\]\n\nNow let's implement these calculations in Python using sympy to maintain exact arithmetic throughout.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the numbers\nbasketball_decks = 6\ncards_per_basketball_deck = 25\nbaseball_boxes = 5\ncards_per_baseball_box = 40\nrare_soccer_cards = 30\ncards_kept = 50\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Total Basketball Cards\ntotal_basketball_cards = basketball_decks * cards_per_basketball_deck\n\n# Total Baseball Cards\ntotal_baseball_cards = baseball_boxes * cards_per_baseball_box\n\n# Total Cards\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards + rare_soccer_cards\n\n# Cards Given to Students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Number of Students\nnumber_of_students = cards_given_to_students / cards_per_student\n\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. **Total Basketball Cards:** \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\)\n2. **Total Baseball Cards:** \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\)\n3. **Total Cards:** \\(150 + 200 + 30 = 380\\)\n4. **Cards Given to Students:** \\(380 - 50 = 330\\)\n5. **Number of Students:** \\(\\frac{330}{10} = 33\\)\n\nThus, the number of students Miss Maria has is \\(\\boxed{33}\\).\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Calculated the total basketball cards correctly: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n2. Calculated the total baseball cards correctly: \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\).\n3. Added all cards properly: \\(150 + 200 + 30 = 380\\).\n4. Subtracted cards kept to find cards given to students: \\(380 - 50 = 330\\).\n5. Divided by cards per student: \\(\\frac{330}{10} = 33\\).\n\nAll steps have been verified and aligned with the problem statement. The solution is complete, and the answer is confirmed. Miss Maria has \\(\\boxed{33}\\) students."

To adhere to the query requirements of avoiding decimal numbers, allowing the output to be a fraction or integer, we should ensure we print the result as an integer.\n\nLet's modify our Python code to ensure the printed result is an integer:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the numbers\nbasketball_decks = 6\ncards_per_basketball_deck = 25\nbaseball_boxes = 5\ncards_per_baseball_box = 40\nrare_soccer_cards = 30\ncards_kept = 50\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Total Basketball Cards\ntotal_basketball_cards = basketball_decks * cards_per_basketball_deck\n\n# Total Baseball Cards\ntotal_baseball_cards = baseball_boxes * cards_per_baseball_box\n\n# Total Cards\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards + rare_soccer_cards\n\n# Cards Given to Students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Number of Students\nnumber_of_students = cards_given_to_students // cards_per_student\n\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\nThis code will output `33` as an integer.
