Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Jessica pays on her debts each year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum required payments each month.\n\n### Key Concept:\nCalculate the total monthly payment for each type of debt after adding 50% to the minimum payment, then multiply by 12 to find the annual payment.\n\n### Step-by-step Process:\n\n1. Calculate 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt type per month.\n2. Sum these adjusted monthly payments to get the total monthly payment.\n3. Multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to get the annual payment.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n- Student Loans: Minimum \\(\\$3000\\)\n  \\[\n  \\text{Adjusted payment} = 3000 + (0.5 \\times 3000) = 4500\n  \\]\n\n- Credit Card: Minimum \\(\\$2000\\)\n  \\[\n  \\text{Adjusted payment} = 2000 + (0.5 \\times 2000) = 3000\n  \\]\n\n- Mortgage: Minimum \\(\\$5000\\)\n  \\[\n  \\text{Adjusted payment} = 5000 + (0.5 \\times 5000) = 7500\n  \\]\n\nSum the adjusted monthly payments:\n\\[\n\\text{Total monthly payment} = 4500 + 3000 + 7500 = 15000\n\\]\n\nMultiply by 12 to get the annual total:\n\\[\n\\text{Total annual payment} = 15000 \\times 12 = 180000\n\\]\n\nLet's express this solution using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Python code\n# Calculate 50% more than the minimum payments for all debts\nstudent_loans_payment = 3000 * 1.5\ncredit_card_payment = 2000 * 1.5\nmortgage_payment = 5000 * 1.5\n\n# Calculate total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loans_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Convert to annual payment\ntotal_annual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_annual_payment)  # Output should be 180000\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the annual payment. After verification, we are confident in our solution.\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. Verified calculations for each 50% increased payment:\n   - Student Loans: \\(4500\\)\n   - Credit Card: \\(3000\\)\n   - Mortgage: \\(7500\\)\n\n2. Verified total monthly payment:\n   - \\(4500 + 3000 + 7500 = 15000\\)\n\n3. Verified annual payment:\n   - \\(15000 \\times 12 = 180000\\)\n\nWith the verified calculations, our answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{180000}\n\\]"

Here is the approach using fractions:\n\nJessica pays 50% more than the minimum required for her debts each month.
