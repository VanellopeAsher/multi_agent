Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 2000 helmets, calculate the total number of items Dominick saw."

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps. The key idea here is to use the relationships between the numbers of robots, helmets, and footballs to find the total number of items.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Identify Known Values:**\n   - We know there are 2000 helmets.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Robots:**\n   - There are half as many robots as helmets. Using the information given:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of robots} = \\frac{\\text{Number of helmets}}{2} = \\frac{2000}{2} = 1000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Footballs:**\n   - There are half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of footballs} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of helmets} = 2 \\times 2000 = 4000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Items:**\n   - Sum up the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total number of items} = 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000\n     \\]\n\nNow, using Python to display the result in a clear manner:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Known number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# Calculating robots and footballs using the given relationships\nrobots = Rational(helmets, 2)\nfootballs = Rational(helmets * 2)\n\n# Calculating total number of items\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\n\n# Printing the total number of items\nprint(total_items)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Verify Calculations:**\n   - Number of helmets = 2000 (Given, correct).\n   - Number of robots = 2000 / 2 = 1000 (Correct calculation).\n   - Number of footballs = 2 * 2000 = 4000 (Correct calculation).\n   - Total = 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000 (Correct total).\n\n2. **Verify Relationships:**\n   - Robots: Half of 2000 helmets is indeed 1000 robots. (Verified)\n   - Helmets: Half of footballs which should give 2000 helmets when footballs are 4000. (Verified)\n\nBoth calculations and their connections are confirmed correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7000}\n\\]"
