Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges. She gifted her mother and her sibling two boxes each. She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself and sold the rest. If each box has 20 oranges, can you determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold?"

After giving some away, keeping some for herself, and then selling the rest, we can determine how many she sold by accounting for these actions.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. Calculate the total number of oranges in a dozen boxes.\n2. Subtract the oranges gifted to her mother and sibling.\n3. Determine how many oranges she kept.\n4. Subtract the kept oranges from the remaining to find out how many she sold.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python using Sympy for handling fractions, ensuring we adhere to your formatting requirements.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total boxes and oranges per box\ntotal_boxes = 12\noranges_per_box = 20\n\n# Total oranges\ntotal_oranges = total_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Oranges given away: 2 boxes each to mother and sibling\ngifted_boxes = 2 + 2\ngifted_oranges = gifted_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Oranges remaining after gifting\nremaining_oranges = total_oranges - gifted_oranges\n\n# Mrs. Harrington keeps a quarter of the remaining for herself\nkept_oranges = Rational(1, 4) * remaining_oranges\n\n# Oranges sold\nsold_oranges = remaining_oranges - kept_oranges\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(f\"Mrs. Harrington sold {sold_oranges} oranges.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. **Total Oranges Calculation:**\n   - \\(12 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ oranges/box} = 240 \\text{ oranges}\\).\n2. **Oranges Gifted:**\n   - \\(4 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ oranges/box} = 80 \\text{ oranges}\\).\n3. **Remaining Oranges after Gifting:**\n   - \\(240 \\text{ oranges} - 80 \\text{ oranges} = 160 \\text{ oranges}\\).\n4. **Oranges Kept:**\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 \\text{ oranges} = 40 \\text{ oranges}\\).\n5. **Oranges Sold:**\n   - \\(160 \\text{ oranges} - 40 \\text{ oranges} = 120 \\text{ oranges}\\).\n\nAfter verifying each step, the calculated number of oranges that Mrs. Harrington sold is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let's recap and ensure everything is clear:\n\n### Recap:\n1. **Total Oranges Calculation:**\n   - Mrs. Harrington started with 12 boxes of oranges, with 20 oranges per box: \n   \\[\n   12 \\times 20 = 240 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n2. **Oranges Gifted:**\n   - She gave away 4 boxes (2 each to her mother and sibling), resulting in:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n3. **Remaining Oranges After Gifting:**\n   - Subtracting the gifted oranges from the total oranges gives:\n   \\[\n   240 - 80 = 160 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n4. **Oranges Kept by Mrs. Harrington:**\n   - She kept a quarter of the remaining oranges:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quarter of } 160 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 = 40 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n5. **Oranges Sold:**\n   - The remaining oranges, after keeping some for herself, were sold:\n   \\[\n   160 - 40 = 120 \\text{ oranges sold}\n   \\]\n\nThe final solution is \\(\\boxed{120}\\). Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges. This value was verified step-by-step in the previously shared solution as well. If there's any further action you need, please let me know!"
