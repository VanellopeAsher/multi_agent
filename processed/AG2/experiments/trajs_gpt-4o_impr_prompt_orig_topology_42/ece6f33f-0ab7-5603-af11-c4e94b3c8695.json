Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJenna shares her living space with four other people. The monthly cost for electricity in their shared home is $100. If they split the cost evenly, what would be the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll take a direct math approach using Python to calculate the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Determine the monthly cost for each person.** Since the electricity cost is $100 per month and it's shared evenly among 5 people, each person pays \\(\\frac{100}{5}\\) dollars per month.\n   \n2. **Calculate the annual contribution for each person.** Multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find out how much each person contributes annually.\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python using the given requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Each person's monthly contribution\nmonthly_contribution = Rational(100, 5)\n\n# Annual contribution per person\nannual_contribution = monthly_contribution * 12\n\n# Output the result using fraction format\nprint(f\"Annual contribution of each roommate: {annual_contribution}\")\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- **Monthly Contribution Calculation**: \\(\\frac{100}{5} = 20\\). So, each person pays $20 per month.\n- **Annual Calculation**: \\(20 \\times 12 = 240\\). Therefore, each person's annual contribution is $240.\n\nThe calculations are straightforward and correct. Thus, the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill is \\(\\boxed{240}\\)."
