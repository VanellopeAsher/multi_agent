Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $52.5. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of finding out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to determine the total cost of the non-pizza items Marie purchased and then use the remaining amount of the total payment to calculate the number of pizza boxes.\n\nLet's go through the solution using a step-by-step process and Python code:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of non-pizza items:**\n   - Chicken meal: $12\n   - 5 packs of milk at $3.5 each: \\(5 \\times 3.5\\)\n   - 4 apples at $1.50 each: \\(4 \\times 1.5\\)\n\n2. **Determine the total cost of non-pizza items.**\n\n3. **Subtract the cost of non-pizza items from the total payment $52.5 to find the total cost expended on pizzas.**\n\n4. **Divide the remaining amount by the cost of each pizza box ($8.50) to find the number of boxes.**\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs of items\nchicken_meal_cost = 12\nmilk_cost_per_pack = 3.5\napple_cost_per = 1.5\npizza_cost_per_box = 8.5\n\n# Quantities purchased\nnum_milk_packs = 5\nnum_apples = 4\n\n# Total amount paid\ntotal_amount_paid = 52.5\n\n# Calculate the total cost of milk and apples\ntotal_milk_cost = num_milk_packs * milk_cost_per_pack\ntotal_apple_cost = num_apples * apple_cost_per\n\n# Total cost of non-pizza items\ntotal_non_pizza_items_cost = chicken_meal_cost + total_milk_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# Remaining amount for pizzas\nremaining_amount_for_pizzas = Rational(total_amount_paid - total_non_pizza_items_cost)\n\n# Calculate the number of pizza boxes\nnum_pizza_boxes = remaining_amount_for_pizzas / pizza_cost_per_box\n\n# Print the result as a fraction if needed\nprint(num_pizza_boxes)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verify calculated cost of non-pizza items:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total non-pizza items cost} = 12 + (5 \\times 3.5) + (4 \\times 1.5) = 12 + 17.5 + 6 = 35.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verify remaining amount for pizzas:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining for pizzas} = 52.5 - 35.5 = 17\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify number of pizza boxes:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pizza boxes} = \\frac{17}{8.5} = 2\n   \\]\n\nAll calculations have been verified to be correct step by step. Hence, the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
