The problem gives us the total distance he runs per week and how this distance is distributed across the days he runs.\n\n**Step-by-step Process:**\n\n1. **Understand the Weekly Running Schedule:**\n   - John runs a total of 60 miles per week over 3 days.\n   - He has one primary running day where he runs a certain distance, let's call this distance \\( x \\).\n   - On the other two days, he runs half of this distance each day (i.e., \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) per day).\n\n2. **Formulate an Equation:**\n   - Total distance run per week \\( = x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n   - This simplifies to \\( x + x = 2x \\).\n   - We know \\( 2x = 60 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Equation for \\( x \\):**\n   - Solve \\( 2x = 60 \\) to find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = 2 * x - 60\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the result in a friendly format\nprint(\"The distance John runs on his primary day is:\", solution[0], \"miles\")\n```\n\n4. **VERIFICATION:**\n   - Calculate the total weekly mileage based on \\( x \\):\n     - Primary day: \\( x = 30 \\) miles.\n     - Each of the other two days: \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\) miles.\n     - Total: \\( 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 \\) miles, which matches the given weekly mileage.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - John runs 30 miles on his primary running day.\n   - On each of his other two running days, he runs 15 miles.\n\nTherefore, the solution is verified, and the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\] (The main running day distance is 30 miles.)"
