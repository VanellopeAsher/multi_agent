Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's go through these structured steps using Case 3: Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Understand the Meaning of Given Information:**\n   - We're told that two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, and there are 6 female unicorns.\n   \n2. **Determine the Total Number of Scottish Unicorns:**\n   - If 6 female unicorns represent two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns, we can set up the equation:  \n     \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{Total Scottish Unicorns} = 6 \\)\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Scottish Unicorns:**\n   - Solving the equation above will provide us with the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Unicorns in the World:**\n   - Since a third of all unicorns in the world are in the Scottish Highlands, use this to determine the global total.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for total Scottish unicorns\ntotal_scottish_unicorns = symbols('total_scottish_unicorns')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the information that two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female\nequation = Eq((2/3) * total_scottish_unicorns, 6)\n\n# Solve for the total number of Scottish unicorns\nscottish_unicorns = solve(equation)[0]\n\n# Calculate the total number of unicorns in the world\n# 1/3 of the world's unicorns are in Scotland\ntotal_world_unicorns = scottish_unicorns * (3/1)\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_world_unicorns)\n```\n\nNow let's verify all these steps in the VERIFICATION section.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Verify the Calculation of Total Scottish Unicorns:**\n\n   - Solve for total Scottish unicorns using: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{Total Scottish Unicorns} = 6 \\)\n   - \\(\\text{Total Scottish Unicorns} = \\frac{6 \\times 3}{2} = 9\\)\n\n2. **Verify the Calculation of Total World Unicorns:**\n\n   - 1/3 of the world's unicorns are 9 (in the Scottish Highlands), so:\n   - Total World Unicorns = \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)\n\nAfter ensuring all calculations are correct and logical, we can present the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]"
