You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.

Let's write a program to solve it.\n\nThe number of red squares is given as 14. \n\nBlue squares are 4 more than red squares, therefore the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.\n\nGreen squares are 6 more than blue squares, therefore the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the total number of colored squares (red, blue and green) is 14 + 18 + 24 = 56.\n\nThe comforter is 68 square feet, so the number of white squares is 68 - 56 = 12.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of white squares from the number of green squares to find out how much fewer white squares there are than green squares.\n\nThis will look like this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the given values\nred_squares = 14\nblue_squares = red_squares + 4\ngreen_squares = blue_squares + 6\ntotal_squares = 68\n\n# Calculate the number of white squares\nwhite_squares = total_squares - red_squares - blue_squares - green_squares\n\n# Calculate how many fewer white squares than green squares\nfewer_white_squares = green_squares - white_squares\n\nprint(fewer_white_squares)\n```\n\nRun this Python code and replace the placeholder below with the correct output.\n\nIf $\\text{{fewer_white_squares}}$ is the output of the Python code, then the number of white squares are $\\boxed{12}$ fewer than green squares."
