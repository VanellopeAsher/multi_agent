You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Given that Alex has 60 points, Bella's points can be calculated as follow:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Bella's points\nalex_points = 60\nbella_points = alex_points * 1.3\nprint('Bella has:', bella_points, 'points')\n```\n\nTim has 40 points less than Bella. So, Tim's points is:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Tim's points\ntim_points = bella_points - 40\nprint('Tim has:', tim_points, 'points')\n```\n\nMary gets 3 times more points than Tim. So, Mary's points can be calculated as follow:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Mary's points\nmary_points = tim_points * 3\nprint('Mary has:', mary_points, 'points')\n```\n\nWe'll then add up these points to get the total points collected by the class.\n\n```python\n# Calculate total points collected by the class\ntotal_points = alex_points + bella_points + mary_points + tim_points\nprint('The class has collected:', total_points, 'points')\n```\n\nFinally, we'll calculate how many points the class is missing to go on the field trip.
