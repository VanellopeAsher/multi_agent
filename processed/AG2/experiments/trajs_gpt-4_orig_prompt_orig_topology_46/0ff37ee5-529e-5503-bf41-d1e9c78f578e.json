You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

      "content": "Key Idea: Ali has $10 bills and $20 bills. The total amount of money he has is even because he can divide it by 2 and 3/5 later. Also, the total number of $10 and $20 bills is an integer. We can calculate backwards from the final $32 to find out the total amount of money he had, and then find out the number of $10 bills.\n\nI will solve this problem in Python directly by using sympy package for integer solutions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let's denote the number of $10 bills as x\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Ali ends up with $32 after spending 3/5 of his remaining money on dinner\nafter_dinner = 32 / (1 - 3/5)\n\n# Ali divided his total money by half,\n# so we need to double the amount he had after giving half to his sister\ntotal_money = after_dinner * 2\n\n# Ali has six $20 bills, so the money from $10 bills is the total money subtract the money from $20 bills\nmoney_from_10_bills = total_money - 6*20\n\n# Since each $10 bill is worth $10,\n# the number of $10 bills is equal to the money from $10 divided by 10\n# Solve this equation to find x\nequation = Eq(x, money_from_10_bills / 10)\nsolution = solve(equation)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(f'The number of $10 bills Ali originally had is {solution[0]}')\n```"
