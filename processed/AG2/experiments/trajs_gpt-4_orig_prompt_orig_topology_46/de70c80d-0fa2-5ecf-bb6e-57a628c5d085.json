You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

Re-writing everything she has already written.\n\nSo we need to know how many letters there are in the alphabet, and how many letters in half of the alphabet. \n\nWe then add the numbers together and multiply by 2 (because she re-writes everything).\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this directly. \n\n```python\n# number of letters in the alphabet\nalphabet_letters = 26\n\n# write the full alphabet three times\nfull_alphabet_times_3 = alphabet_letters * 3 \n\n# write half the alphabet once\nhalf_alphabet_once = alphabet_letters // 2 \n\n# total letters written before re-writing\ntotal_letters_before_rewrite = full_alphabet_times_3 + half_alphabet_once \n\n# re-write everything\ntotal_letters = total_letters_before_rewrite * 2\n\nprint(total_letters)\n```"
