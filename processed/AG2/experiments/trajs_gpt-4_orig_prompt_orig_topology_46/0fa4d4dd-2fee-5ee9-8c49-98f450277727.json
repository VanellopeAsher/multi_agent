  "problem": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

Then, divide this by the amount earned by mowing the lawn per time to get the number of times she must mow the lawn.\n\nUsing python, we can write a program to solve it. Here's the program:\n\n```Python\nfrom sympy import *\n\ndef calculate_lawn_mowing_times(jacket_cost, shoe_cost, babysitting_times, babysitting_pay, lawn_mowing_pay, saved_money):\n    \n    # calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes\n    total_cost = jacket_cost + 2 * shoe_cost\n\n    # calculate the total earned by babysitting\n    total_babysitting = babysitting_times * babysitting_pay\n\n    # calculate the amount needed\n    needed_money = total_cost - total_babysitting - saved_money\n    if needed_money <=0:\n        return 0\n\n    # calculate the times of mowing the lawn\n    lawn_mowing_times = ceiling(needed_money / lawn_mowing_pay)\n\n    return lawn_mowing_times\n\n# test the function\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost = 100\nbabysitting_times = 10\nbabysitting_pay = 5\nlawn_mowing_pay = 10\nsaved_money = 100\n\ntimes = calculate_lawn_mowing_times(jacket_cost, shoe_cost, babysitting_times, babysitting_pay, lawn_mowing_pay, saved_money)\nprint(times)\n```\n\nThe output will be the number of times Sara must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes."

The 'ceiling' function is used to round up the division result because she can't mow the lawn a fractional number of times.\n"
