You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

First, we will calculate the amount spent on everything else (chicken meal, milk packs, and apples), subtract it from the total amount paid, and then divide the remaining amount by the cost per box of pizza.\n\nLet's use Python to solve this step by step.\n```python\n# price of chicken meal\nchicken_price = 120 \n\n# cost of one pack of milk\nmilk_price = 30\n# quantity of milk packs \nmilk_qty = 5\n\n# cost of one apple\napple_price = 1.50 \n# quantity of apples\napple_qty = 40 \n\n# cost of one box of pizza\npizza_price = 57 \n\n# total amount Marie paid\ntotal_amount_paid = 900 \n\n# First, calculate the total price for milk and apples\ntotal_milk_price = milk_price * milk_qty\ntotal_apple_price = apple_price * apple_qty\n\n# The sum of chicken, milk, and apple costs\ntotal_price_without_pizza = chicken_price + total_milk_price + total_apple_price \n\n# now subtract this sum from the total amount paid to get the amount spent on pizza\ntotal_pizza_price = total_amount_paid - total_price_without_pizza \n\n# Finally, divide this by the price of one pizza to get how many pizzas were ordered\nno_of_pizzas = total_pizza_price // pizza_price \n\nprint(no_of_pizzas)\n```\nThe output of the print statement will be the number of pizzas ordered by Marie."
