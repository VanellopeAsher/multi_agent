You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOf the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic.

Then we subtract the number of cars that are rented out or under maintenance from the total number of cars, this gives us the total number of available cars. Then, we find out the percentage of the semi-automatic cars out of the available cars.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1. Find out the number of semi-automatic cars.\n2. Subtract the number of cars that are rented out or under maintenance from the total number of cars.\n3. Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the available cars.\n\nLet's code this with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total number of cars\ntotal_cars = 20\n# number of automatic cars\nauto_cars = 12\n# number of manual cars\nmanual_cars = 4\n# number of rented or under maintenance cars\nrented_maintenance_cars = 3 + 2\n\n# find out the number of semi-automatic cars\nsemi_auto_cars = total_cars - auto_cars - manual_cars\n# find out the number of available cars\navailable_cars = total_cars - rented_maintenance_cars\n# calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the available cars\npercentage_semi_auto = (semi_auto_cars / available_cars) * 100\n\nprint(percentage_semi_auto)\n```\n\nWe can simplify our answer to a fraction or to the lowest terms if possible, using the `simplify` function from sympy. The output of the code should be in the \\boxed{} as the final answer."
