You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJoey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble.

Let me correct this. \n\nLet's say Joey scores 'x' points. So, Joey's new score would be: 214 + x. \n\nSince we don't know how many points Joey scored, we cannot compute the answer unless 'x' is given. In the previous calculation, 'x' is implicitly treated as zero. \n\nIf we still want to express the result in terms of 'x', the Python code would look like this: \n\n```python\n# your code\n\nJoey_score = 214 + x\nMarcy_score = 225 + 10  # Marcy gets 10 more points\n\nwinning_points = Joey_score - Marcy_score\nprint(winning_points)\n```\n\nThen, 'winning_points' would be the result on Joey's winning points."

In light of this error, 'x' should be assigned a value for the calculation to proceed as desired. However, as 'x' is an unknown quantity, we're unable to assign it an absolute numerical value. Therefore, the formula should be slighlty modified.\n\nWe should create a function to calculate the score difference. The function could look like this:\n\n```python\n# your code\n\ndef winning_points(x): \n    Joey_score = 214 + x\n    Marcy_score = 225 + 10  # Marcy gets 10 more points\n\n    winning_points = Joey_score - Marcy_score\n    return winning_points\n```\n\nNow you can call this function with any number of points Joey scored to determine by how many points he is now winning. For example, if Joey scored 22 points, the function call would look like `winning_points(22)`."
