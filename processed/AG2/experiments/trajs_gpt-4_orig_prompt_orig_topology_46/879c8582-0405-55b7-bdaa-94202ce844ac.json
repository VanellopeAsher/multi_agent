She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "The problem can be solved directly with Python. First, we need to calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has, which is the sum of basketball cards, baseball cards, rare soccer cards and the cards she keeps. Then, we subtract the cards she keeps from the total number of cards to find out the number of cards the students got. Lastly, we divide the number of cards the students got by 10 (since each student got 10 cards) to find out the number of students.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve it:\n```python\n# calculate the total number of basketball cards, baseball cards and rare soccer cards\ntotal_basketball_cards = 6 * 25\ntotal_baseball_cards = 5 * 40\ntotal_soccer_cards = 30\n\n# calculate the total number of cards\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards + total_soccer_cards\n\n# calculate the number of cards the students got\ncards_students_got = total_cards - 50\n\n# calculate the number of students\nnum_students = cards_students_got // 10\nprint(num_students)\n```"
