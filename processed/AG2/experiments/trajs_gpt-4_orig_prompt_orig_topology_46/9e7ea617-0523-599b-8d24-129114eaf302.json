You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard.

Then add the heights of the shortest and the second tree. After that, double this sum to obtain the height of the tallest tree.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# height of the shortest tree\nshortest_tree = 60 \n# height of the second tree\nsecond_tree = shortest_tree + 50 \n# total height of the shortest and second trees\ntotal_height = shortest_tree + second_tree \n# height of the tallest tree\ntallest_tree = 2 * total_height\n\nprint(\"The height of the tallest tree is\", tallest_tree, \"feet.\")\n```"
