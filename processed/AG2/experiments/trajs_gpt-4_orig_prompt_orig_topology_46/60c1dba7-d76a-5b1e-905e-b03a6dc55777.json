You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

B = S + 15 (because Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick)\n3. S = 4P (because Smendrick has 4 times the cards that PJ has)\n\nWe can use the sympy package of Python to solve these equations. \n\nI will do these steps:\n1. Create the equations according to the scenario.\n2. Solve the equations to get the number of cards that Becca has.\n\nHere is the Python code using sympy to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbols\nB, S, P = symbols('B S P')\n\n# define the equations\neq1 = Eq(B + S + P, 447)\neq2 = Eq(B, S + 15)\neq3 = Eq(S, 4 * P)\n\n# solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (B, S, P))\n\n# get the number of cards Becca has\nbecca_cards = solution[B]\n\n# print the result\nprint(becca_cards)\n```\n\nThe output will be the number of cards Becca has."
