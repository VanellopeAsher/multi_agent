You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKatarina has 5 less cookies than Max has.

We know the number of cookies Katarina has, the others' are all in relation to her.\n\nThe equations to be set according to problem are: \n\n1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has. Hence, Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina.\n2. Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So the cookies for the Cookie Monster can be found by dividing Max's cookies by 1.2 and subtracting 10.\n3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Hence, cookies Summer has is equal to Max's cookies plus 23.\n4. Katarina has 68 cookies (6.8*10). \n\nThen we sum up all the cookies.\n\nLet's write the Python program:"
