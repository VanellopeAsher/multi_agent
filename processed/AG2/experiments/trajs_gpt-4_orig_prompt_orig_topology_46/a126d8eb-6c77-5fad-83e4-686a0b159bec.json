You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJake is shopping at a clothing store.

After getting the discounted prices, you sum them up to have the total amount spent.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the T-shirts considering the one gets one 50% discount.\n2. Calculate the cost of the shoes after a 40% discount.\n3. Sum up the above quantities.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate it:\n```python\n# number of T-shirts\nnum_tshirts = 20\n\n# cost of each T-shirt\ncost_tshirt = 80\n\n# number of paid T-shirts\nnum_paid_tshirts_full_price = num_tshirts // 2\n\n# number of half price T-shirts\nnum_half_price_tshirts = num_tshirts - num_paid_tshirts_full_price\n\n# total cost of T-shirts\ntotal_tshirts_cost = num_paid_tshirts_full_price * cost_tshirt + num_half_price_tshirts * cost_tshirt * 0.5\n\n# original price of the shoes\ncost_shoes_original = 400\n\n# cost of the shoes after 40% discount\ncost_shoes_discounted = cost_shoes_original * (1 - 0.4)\n\n# total spending\ntotal_spending = total_tshirts_cost + cost_shoes_discounted\n\nprint(total_spending)\n```\n\nThe result is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store."
