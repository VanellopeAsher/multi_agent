You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery packet of graham crackers can be used to create the base for 8 big smores.

After that, calculate the total number of smores that can be made using a box of graham crackers and finally get the number of boxes required by dividing total smores required with smores per box.\n\nLet's implement this with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the variables\nchildren = 9\nchildren_smores = 2\nadults = 6\nadult_smores = 1\npackets_per_box = 3\nsmores_per_packet = 8\n\n# Calculate total smores required\ntotal_smores_required = (children * children_smores) + (adults * adult_smores)\n\n# Calculate total smores that can be created from a box of graham crackers\ntotal_smores_per_box = packets_per_box * smores_per_packet\n\n# Calculate the total boxes needed by dividing total smores required with smores per box\nboxes_required = ceiling(total_smores_required / total_smores_per_box)\n\nprint(boxes_required)\n```\n\nPlease run this code and provide the output."
