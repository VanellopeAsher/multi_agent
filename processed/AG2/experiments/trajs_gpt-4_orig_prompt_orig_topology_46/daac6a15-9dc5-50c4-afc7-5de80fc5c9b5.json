You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDerrick has a bakery that makes doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut.

If Derrick's bakery operates every day in June or is there any day it doesn't.\n\nAfter obtaining these pieces of information, we can calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the daily amount of money Derrick makes from selling doughnuts with the number of operating days in June. The daily amount of money can be obtained by multiplying the number of doughnuts made each day by the price per doughnut.\nThe python code for this can be written as:\n\n```python\n# number of doughnuts made each day\ndoughnuts_per_day = ?\n\n# number of operating days in June\noperating_days = ?\n\n# money made each day\nmoney_per_day = doughnuts_per_day * 2\n\n# total money made in June\ntotal_money = money_per_day * operating_days\n\nprint(total_money)\n```\nPlease provide the missing information."
