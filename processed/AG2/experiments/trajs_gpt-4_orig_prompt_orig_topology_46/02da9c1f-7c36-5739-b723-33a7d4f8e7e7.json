You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Without knowing the total length of the ribbon that Monica has, we cannot calculate the length of ribbon she can use for each gift. \n\nHowever, if we did have that information and assumed that the total length of the ribbon Monica has is 'R' inches, then the length of ribbon Monica could use for each gift would be calculated as follows:\n```python\n# Total number of gifts\ntotal_gifts = 6 + 4 + 2\n# Calculate the length of ribbon per gift\nribbon_per_gift = R / total_gifts\nprint(ribbon_per_gift)\n```\n\nTherefore, without knowing the total length of ribbon that Monica has, it is impossible to determine the length of ribbon she can use for each bow.
