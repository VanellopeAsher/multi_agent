You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJordan plays video games every day.

Once that value is available, the Python code for the solution would look like this:\n\n```python\n# your code here\nX = ... # The average number of hours Jordan spends playing video games each day\nhourly_wage = 10\n\n# Calculate the earnings\ndaily_earnings = hourly_wage * X\nweekly_earnings = daily_earnings * 7  # There are 7 days in a week\n\nprint(weekly_earnings)\n```\n\nThe output of this program would tell us how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working instead.
