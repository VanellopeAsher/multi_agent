You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

In 5 years, Emil will be twice as old as his brother. This gives us the equation: `Emil's current age + 5 = 2 * (Brother's current age + 5)`.\n2. In 5 years, Emil will be half as old as his dad. This gives us the equation: `Emil's current age + 5 = 1/2 * (Dad's current age + 5)`.\n\nWe can solve these two equations with Python to find dad's and brother's current ages. After that we just need to add those two ages.\n\nLet's write the python code to solve these equations. Our unknowns are `Dad's current age` and `Brother's current age`.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nD_age, B_age = symbols('D_age B_age')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(21 + 5, 2 * (B_age + 5))\neq2 = Eq(21 + 5, 1/2 * (D_age + 5))\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (D_age, B_age))\n\n# Display the solution\nprint(f\"Dad's current age: {solution[D_age]}, Brother's current age: {solution[B_age]}\")\n\n# Find the sum of the Dad's and Brother's current ages\nsum_of_ages = solution[D_age] + solution[B_age]\nprint(f\"The sum of Dad's and Brother's current ages is: {sum_of_ages}\")\n```"
