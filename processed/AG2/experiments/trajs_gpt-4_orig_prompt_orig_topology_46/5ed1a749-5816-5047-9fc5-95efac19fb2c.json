You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.

The problem can be best solved by writing a Python function that takes the size of the first Lego box as the parameter, multiplies it by 3 to get the size of the second Lego box, divides it by 4 to get the size of the third Lego box, and then sums all these three quantities to find the total number of Lego pieces that Johnny picks up.\n\nHere is the Python code that does this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Let x be the number of pieces in the first Lego box\nx = symbols('x')\n# Then, the expression for the total number of pieces is x + 3*x + x/4\ntotal_pieces = x + 3*x + x/4\n# Simplify the expression and print it\nprint('Total number of pieces: ', simplify(total_pieces))\n```\n\nGiven the number of pieces in the first box, we can substitute this value into `x` to find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up."

As the exercise asks for the total number of Lego pieces, let's say for example that first set has 4 pieces, then Johnny picks up 17 pieces in total.\n\nHere is the Python code that does this calculation:\n\n```python\nfirst_set_pieces = 4  # assign the number of pieces in the first set\ntotal_pieces = 17/4 * first_set_pieces  # calculate the total number of pieces\nprint(\"Total number of pieces Johnny picks up: \", total_pieces)\n```\n\nAnd if the number in the first set changes, we just need to modify the `first_set_pieces`."
