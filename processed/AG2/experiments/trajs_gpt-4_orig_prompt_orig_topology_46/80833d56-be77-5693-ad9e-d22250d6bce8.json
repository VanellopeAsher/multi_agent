You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 100 miles a week.

As he runs half as much on the other two days, this means he runs for 5 hours each of those days.\n\nIn total, John spends 10 hours the first day, and 5 hours each on the second and third day, running. We can add these three amounts together to find the total amount of hours John spends running.\n\nOnce we have the total number of hours, we can find out how fast John runs by dividing the total distance (100 miles) by the total time in hours.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of hours first."
