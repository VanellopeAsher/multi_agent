You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to calculate the total number of wheels used to assemble the toys. Each car requires 4 wheels and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels, so we'll multiply the number of each type of toys by the number of wheels they require. Subtract the number of used wheels from the number of wheels left, and we'll get the total number of wheels in the box.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the number of cars and motorcycles\ncars = 57\nmotorcycles = 73\n\n# define the number of wheels for each car and each motorcycle\nwheels_per_car = 4\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\n\n# calculate the number of used wheels\nused_wheels = cars * wheels_per_car + motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle\n\n# define the number of wheels left\nwheels_left = 276\n\n# calculate the total number of wheels in the box\ntotal_wheels = used_wheels + wheels_left\n\n# print the result\nprint(total_wheels)\n```\n"
