Then, we will calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself, given that the number of oranges she sold accounted for 3/4 of the total number of oranges. After subtracting the oranges that Mrs. Harrington kept and the oranges she gave to her family from the total number of oranges, we'll find out the number of oranges that were sold.\n\nHere's how:\n\nLet's denote:\n- The number of boxes Mrs. Harrington originally bought as 'x'.\n- The number of boxes Mrs. Harrington gave to her mom and sister as 'y' (2 boxes for each, so total 4).\n- The number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself as 'z'.\n\nGiven the problem, we have the following equations:\n- x * 20 = oranges Mrs. Harrington had,\n- y * 20 = oranges she gave to her family,\n- z = 1/4 * oranges Mrs. Harrington originally bought,\n- oranges Mrs. Harrington sold = x * 20 - y * 20 - z.\n\nLet's calculate the oranges Mrs. Harrington sold from the above equations."

In this particular problem, we cannot have negative quantities for boxes or oranges as they are physical quantities and cannot be negative. \n\nLet's reconsider the problem and reevaluate our equations. We know that Mrs. Harrington:\n\n1. Gave away 4 boxes of oranges (2 to her mother and 2 to her sister).\n2. Sold three-quarters of the remaining oranges.\n\nWe can conclude that Mrs. Harrington bought `x` boxes of oranges and gave away `4` boxes. This means she had `x-4` boxes left.\n\nShe kept one-quarter of the remaining oranges, meaning she sold three-quarters. Therefore, she sold `(3/4)*(x-4)*20` oranges.\n\nLet's find out the number of boxes `x` that makes this true. \n\n```python\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# equation for the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought\neq = Eq((3/4)*(x-4)*20, x*20)\n\n# solve for x\nsolution = solve(eq, x)\n\nprint(f\"Mrs. Harrington bought {solution[0]} boxes of oranges.\")\nsold = (3/4)*(solution[0]-4)*20\nprint(f\"So, she sold {sold} oranges.\")\n```\n\nBy running this code, we find the number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought and the number of oranges she sold."

Let's try a different approach. \n\nWe know that Mrs. Harrington sold three-quarters of the oranges she initially had, minus the 4 boxes of oranges she gave to her mother and sister. Hence, the 4 boxes given away are equal to one-quarter (the remaining fraction) of the initial number of boxes.\n\nSo, Mrs. Harrington initially must have had 4 boxes * 4 = 16 boxes of oranges. \n\nEach box contains 20 oranges, so she sold three-quarters of the 16 boxes she initially had, which equates to `(3/4) * 16 boxes * 20 oranges/box = sold oranges`.\n\nLet's calculate how many she sold. \n\n```python\nx = 16 # initial number of boxes\noranges_per_box = 20 \nsold = (3/4) * x * oranges_per_box\n\nprint(f\"So, she sold {sold} oranges.\")\n```\n\nBy running this code, we find the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold."
