You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to first calculate Mark's weight change during his sickness and recovery, then use this to determine his initial weight prior to falling ill. \n\nDuring his illness, Mark lost 10 pounds a month for 3 months. Then, on his road to recovery, he gained 5 pounds a month for 2 months. Thus, we need to calculate both the total weight lost and gained, then combine these to find the total change in Mark's weight. After that subtract this change from Mark's final weight to get his initial weight.\n\nThis problem can be solved by Python directly:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_initial_weight(final_weight, weight_lost_per_month, sick_months, weight_gained_per_month, recovery_months):\n    total_weight_lost = weight_lost_per_month * sick_months\n    total_weight_gained = weight_gained_per_month * recovery_months\n    total_change = total_weight_lost - total_weight_gained\n\n    initial_weight = final_weight + total_change\n\n    return initial_weight\n\nprint(calculate_initial_weight(70, 10, 3, 5, 2))\n```\n\nThis code calculates Mark's initial weight. It first calculates the total weight loss and gain, then adjust Mark's final weight by the weight change (loss and gain). The function `calculate_initial_weight` takes in the parameters of final weight, weight lost per month, the duration of being sick, weight gained per month, and the duration of recovery, to return the initial weight."
