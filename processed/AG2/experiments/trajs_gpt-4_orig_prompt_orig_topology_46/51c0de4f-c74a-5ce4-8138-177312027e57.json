  "problem": "Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money. If Walter's lawyer contributed $6600 in total, how much did his friend give him?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

We can represent this in an equation and solve for the amount contributed by Walter's friend.\n\nLet's say F is the amount of money that Walter's friend gave him:\n\n500 (from neighbors) + 1500 (from the online fund) + F (from friend) = 6600 / 3 \n\nWe just need to solve for F. \n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this equation."
