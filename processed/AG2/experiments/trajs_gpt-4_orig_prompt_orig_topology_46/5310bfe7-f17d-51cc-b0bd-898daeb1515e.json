You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

      "content": "The key idea to solving this problem is understanding how the score difference is related to the actual score. According to the problem, Richie's score is compared to both Mark's score and Anna's score. Given that we know Richie's score, we can deduce the scores of Mark and Anna by subtracting accordingly. Then, to get the total score, we add the scores of all three teenagers together.\n\nWe can solve this using Python directly.\n\n```python\n# write python code\nRichie_score = 90\n\n# Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark\nMark_score = Richie_score - 30\n\n# Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna\nAnna_score = Richie_score - 55\n\n# Calculate the total score\ntotal_score = Richie_score + Mark_score + Anna_score\nprint(total_score)\n```"
