You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

After that, we get the number of people he can help in a day, and finally we multiply this by the number of working days to find out the total number of people he can help. \n\nWe can write Python code to solve this problem directly. The steps are as follows:\n1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.\n2. Calculate the working days, which is 80% of the total days.\n3. According to the given conditions, he can help 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours a day, so calculate the number of people he can help each day,\n4. Multiply the number of working days by the number of people he can help each day to get the final answer.\n\nThis will look like this in Python:\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.\ntotal_days = 31 + 19\n\n# step 2: Calculate the working days, which is 80% of the total days.\nworking_days = total_days * 0.8\n\n# step 3: Calculate the number of people he can help each day,\npeople_per_day = 2 * 3.5\n\n# step 4: Multiply the number of working days by the number of people he can help each day to get the final answer.\ntotal_people_helped = working_days * people_per_day\n\nprint(total_people_helped)\n```"
