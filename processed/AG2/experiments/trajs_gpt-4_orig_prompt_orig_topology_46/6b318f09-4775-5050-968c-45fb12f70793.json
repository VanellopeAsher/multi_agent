You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

We know the number of families Martha invited and the size of those families, so the total number of people expected to attend the party can be easily calculated by multiplying the number of families by their size. Then we subtract those who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of families and members in each family\nfamilies_of_six = 12\nmembers_in_six = 6\n\nfamilies_of_four = 15\nmembers_in_four = 4\n\n# Number of people who couldn't come\ncouldn't_come_illness = 16\ncouldn't_come_commitments = couldn't_come_illness / 4\n\n# Total expected people\ntotal_people = (families_of_six * members_in_six) + (families_of_four * members_in_four)\n\n# Finally, the number of attended people\nattended_people = total_people - couldn't_come_illness - couldn't_come_commitments\n\nprint(attended_people)\n```\n\nRemember to include the sympy package at the beginning, which will allow you to perform symbolic computations in Python."
