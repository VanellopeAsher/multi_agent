You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIf Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 80 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?"

      "content": "Key Idea to solve this problem:\nGiven that Harry gets 80 feet more fence than Sam, if we represent the fence that Sam gets as 'f', then Harry's fence is 'f+80'. Adding both, it equals the total fence length i.e., 200. Forming this equation, we can solve it.\n\nCase 1: The problem can be solved with Python code directly. Let's write a program to solve it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let f be the fence that Sam gets.\nf = symbols('f')\n\n# Harry gets 'f+80'. Total fence length is 'f+(f+80)' which equals to 200.\neq = Eq(f+(f+80), 200)\n\n# solving the equation\nfence_for_sam = solve(eq, f)[0]\nprint(fence_for_sam)\n```"
