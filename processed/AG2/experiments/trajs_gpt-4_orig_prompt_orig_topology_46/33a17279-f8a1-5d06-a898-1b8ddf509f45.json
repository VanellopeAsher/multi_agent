You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each.

      "content": "We can solve this problem by summing up Susan's earnings and subtracting the amount she gave away. From the given problem we know:\n\n- Number of cookies sold: 80 at $1 each. \n- Number of cupcakes sold: 60 at $4 each. \n- She gave her two sisters $10 each. \n- She gave away $15 to a local charity. \n\nWe can calculate the total earning from cookies and cupcakes sales and then subtract the total amounts of money she gave out to her sisters and the charity. \n\nLet's write a Python code to execute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of cookies and price per cookie\nnum_cookies = 80\nprice_cookie = 1\n\n# Number of cupcakes and price per cupcake\nnum_cupcakes = 60\nprice_cupcake = 4\n\n# Money given to sisters and charity\nmoney_to_sisters = 2 * 10\nmoney_to_charity = 15\n\n# Total earnings from cookies and cupcakes\ntotal_earnings = num_cookies * price_cookie + num_cupcakes * price_cupcake\n\n# Total amount given out\ntotal_out = money_to_sisters + money_to_charity\n\n# Remaining money\nremaining_money = total_earnings - total_out\n\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\nWe expect the remaining amount of money Suzanne has to be output from this code."
