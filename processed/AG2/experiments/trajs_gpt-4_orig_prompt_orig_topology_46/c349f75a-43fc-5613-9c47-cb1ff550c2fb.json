You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is finding the sum of all the siblings' ages. \n\nWe first find the older brother's age by multiplying the younger brother's age by 2. Then we multiply the age of one sister by the total number of sisters. Lastly, we add together the ages of the brothers and the total age of all sisters.\n\nHere is a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# define the ages and number of siblings\nage_of_younger_brother = 12\nage_of_sisters = 16\nnumber_of_sisters = 10\n\n# calculate the age of the older brother\nage_of_older_brother = age_of_younger_brother * 2\n\n# calculate the total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = (age_of_older_brother + age_of_younger_brother) + (age_of_sisters * number_of_sisters)\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nThis script uses variables to store the ages and performs simple arithmetic to get the total age. \n\nLastly, always remember to put your final answer in a box for clarity."
