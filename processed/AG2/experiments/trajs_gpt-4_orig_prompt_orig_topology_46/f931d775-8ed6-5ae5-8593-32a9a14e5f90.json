  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.

      "content": "First, let's understand the problem. \n\n- Sean has to memorize all the lines of his solo song, which has 54 lines.\n- The first scene has twice the number of lines than the song, i.e., 2*54 = 108 lines. But, only a third of them are Sean's lines. Hence, Sean's lines in the first scene are 108/3 = 36 lines.\n- The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, i.e., 54+6 = 60 lines. Of these, 4/5*60 = 48 are Sean's lines.\n- Additionally, Sean still has to memorize 15 more lines from the second scene because one actor can't come.\n\nThe total number of lines that Sean has to memorize can be calculated by summing up all the lines mentioned above. \n\nSo, the key idea to solve this problem is to understand the problem and perform the necessary calculations. \n\nSince the problem can be solved with Python code, let's follow Case 1 to solve this problem.\n\nLet's write a python program for our calculations."
