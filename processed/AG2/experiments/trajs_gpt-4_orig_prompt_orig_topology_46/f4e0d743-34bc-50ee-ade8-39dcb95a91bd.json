  "problem": "Every month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Additionally, Madeline also buys a special shampoo for her dog that costs $15 per month and a toy that costs $10 every two months. If there are 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year, how much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

      "content": "This problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\nThe first step is to compute the monthly cost for each item. After that, multiply these monthly costs by 12 to get the yearly cost.\n\nHere is the detailed plan:\n- For food, the cost per week should be multiplied by the number of weeks in a month.\n- The rest of the costs can be added directly because they are already monthly costs.\n- For the toy, since it is bought every two months, its cost should be halved to get the monthly cost.\n- Summing up all these results gives you the monthly cost, which can be multiplied by 12 to get the yearly expenditure.\n\nThis is the Python code, which follows the above steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define variables\nfood_per_week = 25\ntreats_per_month = 20\nmedicine_per_month = 100\nshampoo_per_month = 15\ntoy_every_two_months = 10\n\n# calculate monthly cost for each item\nfood_per_month = food_per_week * 4\ntoy_per_month = toy_every_two_months / 2\n\n# summation of monthly cost\ntotal_monthly_cost = food_per_month + treats_per_month + medicine_per_month + shampoo_per_month + toy_per_month\n\n# compute yearly cost\ntotal_yearly_cost = total_monthly_cost * 12\n\n# print the total yearly cost\nprint(total_yearly_cost)\n```"
