You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts.

      "content": "Looking at the problem, the cost Patty would charge can be calculated mathematically. Thus, we can solve the problem directly using Python. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Patty charges a flat $40 service fee for each job.\n2. She also charges $35 for every hour or fraction of an hour of work. Hence, every fractional hour is rounded up to the next whole number of hours. In this job, she worked for 2.25 hours which rounds up to 3 hours.\n3. The cost of parts is also added to the bill.\n4. Adding up all these components gives us the total bill.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this problem."
