For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month. On the twelfth month, he will pay the remaining amount, including the interest, and also plans to buy a coin worth $100.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to first calculate the total amount of money Stephen owe his sister by adding 2% interest to the money he borrowed. Then subtract the amount of money Stephen already paid his sister during the 11 months from the total amount. The difference is the amount Stephen would pay his sister in the 12th month.\n\nLet's solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Stephen owes his sister by adding 2% interest to the money he borrowed.\n2. Calculate the total money Stephen already paid to his sister during the 11 months.\n3. Subtract the money Stephen already paid his sister from total amount he owes. This will give us the amount Stephen would pay his sister in the 12th month.\n\nIf we look at the problem, all the above steps involve calculations. Hence, we can solve these steps by writing Python code. Here is the Python code for the task:\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Given values\nborrowed_money = 300  # The amount of money Stephen borrowed from his sister\nmonth_payment = 25  # The amount of money Stephen pays every month\nnum_months = 11  # Number of months Stephen has already paid\nintrest_rate = 2/100  # the percentage of interest  \n\n# Calculate the total money with interest\ntotal_money = borrowed_money + borrowed_money*intrest_rate\n# Calculate the total money Stephen has already paid\npaid_money = month_payment * num_months\n# Calculate the remaining money to be paid in 12th month\nremaining_money = total_money - paid_money\n\nprint(remaining_money)\n```"
