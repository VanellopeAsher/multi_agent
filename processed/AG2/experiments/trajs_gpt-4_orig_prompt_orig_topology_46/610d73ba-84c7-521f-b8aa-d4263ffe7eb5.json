You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPaisley, Reggie, and Lynn went for a run. Paisley covered a distance of 4 miles. Reggie ran a distance that was five times the distance that Paisley ran and also 3 miles more than what Lynn ran. Can you determine the distance that Lynn ran?"

The returned value from solve function is a list, but L is a symbolic variable. We cannot substitute the symbolic variable L with the list. Also, we should avoid reassigning symbolic variables like P, R, and L directly unless we convert them to a normal variable. Here's the corrected script:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbols\nP, R, L = symbols('P R L')\n\n# given: Paisley ran a distance of 4 miles\npaisley_distance = 4\n\n# given equations\nequation1 = Eq(R, 5 * P)\nequation2 = Eq(R, L + 3)\n\n# substitute P = 4 into R = 5 * P to find the distance that Reggie ran\nreggie_distance = solve(equation1.subs(P, paisley_distance), R)\n\n# substitute R into R = L + 3 to find the distance that Lynn ran\nlynn_distance = solve(equation2.subs(R, reggie_distance[0]), L)\n\nprint('The distance that Lynn ran: ', lynn_distance[0])\n```\nYou can run this Python script now to find the distance that Lynn ran."
