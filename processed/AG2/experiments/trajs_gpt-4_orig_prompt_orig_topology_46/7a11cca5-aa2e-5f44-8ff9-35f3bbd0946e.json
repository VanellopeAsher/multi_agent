You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

So the increased volume on this day should be 14000 gallons minus the total amount of the first two days.\n\nWe just need to do a simple subtraction.\n\nLet's do the calculation:\n\n```python\n# your code here\nfirst_day_volume = 4000  # volume of the first day\nsecond_day_volume = 2 * first_day_volume  # volume of the second day\nthird_day_total = 14000  # total volume of the third day\n\n# calculate the increased volume on the third day\nthird_day_increase = third_day_total - first_day_volume - second_day_volume\nprint(third_day_increase)\n```\n\nThe result will be the increased volume on the third day."
