The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, after 10 hours, the sun starts moving at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "The key idea to solve the problem is to consider the movement of the sun in two stages and add the total degrees moved to the initial position of the sun. \n\nIn the first stage, the sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours, thus moving a total of = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.\n\nIn the second stage, the rate changes to 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours, thus moving a total of = 3 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 6 degrees.\n\nThe initial position of the sun is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. Adding these all together will give us the final position of the sun.\n\nLet's calculate it in Python directly:\n\n```python\n# initial position of the sun\ninit_angle = 32\n\n# moving rate in first stage\nfirst_stage_rate = 5\nfirst_stage_hours = 10\n\n# moving rate in second stage\nsecond_stage_rate = 3\nsecond_stage_hours = 2\n\n# calculate the total degrees moved in first stage\nfirst_stage_total = first_stage_rate * first_stage_hours\n\n# calculate the total degrees moved in second stage\nsecond_stage_total = second_stage_rate * second_stage_hours\n\n# calculate the final position of the sun\nfinal_angle = init_angle + first_stage_total + second_stage_total\n\nprint(final_angle)\n```\n\nThe result is the final position of the sun in degrees from the ground. So the correct answer will be $\\boxed{\\text{final_angle}}$ in degrees."
