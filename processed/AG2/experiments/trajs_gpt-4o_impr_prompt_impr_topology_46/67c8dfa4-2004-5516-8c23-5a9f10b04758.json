      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to figure out how many packs of canvas bags Tara bought given her cost and profit.\n\n1. **Define the Variables**: \n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of 5 canvas bags that Tara bought.\n   - Each pack costs $4, so Tara's total cost for \\( x \\) packs is \\( 4x \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Revenue and Profit**:\n   - Each canvas bag is sold for $8. Since each pack contains 5 bags, Tara sells \\( 5x \\) bags in total.\n   - The revenue from selling \\( 5x \\) bags is \\( 8 \\times 5x = 40x \\) dollars.\n   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. According to the problem, Tara's profit is $160.\n\n3. **Set up the Profit Equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   160 = 40x - 4x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equation**:\n   \\[\n   160 = 36x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{160}{36}\n   \\]\n   Simplify \\(\\frac{160}{36}\\) to \\(\\frac{40}{9}\\). Since \\( x \\) must be a whole number (number of packs), let's determine a suitable whole number for packs based on the context used in practice (possibly error-bound adjustments or assuming fractions entertain whole value purchases).\n\n5. **Estimate Compatibility** (as if adjustment for packs were theoretically advisable):\n   - Direct proportional solution might not meet integer pack if mistaken value.\n   - Round or attempt probable pack derivations iteratively if fit:\n     - \\[ 160 = (36) \\text{integer nearest packs ordered} \\]\n     - In blind adjusted estimation, correction yields and hypotheses as errors/practice errors.\n\nEssentially:\n- Understanding intentional phrasing and potential arithmetic assessment from exact operations gives insights into needing viable clarifications.\n\nGiven she must have purchased whole packs, potential solution benefit from integer reassessment or conditions described, yet usually it won't imply standard breaks deliberately executing theoretical models reflected as intended. Further discussion could adjust numeric understanding more definitively to entire pack reproof."

Based on given constraints and calculations, there can be no final integer-based solution delivered.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
