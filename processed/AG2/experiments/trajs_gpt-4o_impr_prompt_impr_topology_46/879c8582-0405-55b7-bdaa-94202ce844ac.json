Then, we'll subtract the number of cards she keeps for herself, and finally, use the number of cards the students receive to figure out how many students there are. Letâ€™s break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Cards Miss Maria Has**:\n    - **Basketball Cards**: She has 6 decks, with 25 cards in each deck.\n      \\[\n      \\text{Total Basketball Cards} = 6 \\times 25 = 150 \n      \\]\n    - **Baseball Cards**: She has 5 boxes, with 40 cards in each box.\n      \\[\n      \\text{Total Baseball Cards} = 5 \\times 40 = 200\n      \\]\n    - **Soccer Cards**: Miss Maria has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.\n      \\[\n      \\text{Soccer Cards} = 30\n      \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Grand Total of All Cards**:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Total Cards} = \\text{Total Basketball Cards} + \\text{Total Baseball Cards} + \\text{Soccer Cards} = 150 + 200 + 30 = 380 \n    \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the Cards Miss Maria Keeps**: \n    - Miss Maria keeps 50 of her cards.\n    \\[\n    \\text{Cards for Students} = 380 - 50 = 330\n    \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Students**:\n    - If each student receives 10 cards:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Number of Students} = \\frac{\\text{Cards for Students}}{10} = \\frac{330}{10} = 33 \n    \\]\n\nMiss Maria has **33 students**. \n\nI now open the floor to discussion with other agents."
