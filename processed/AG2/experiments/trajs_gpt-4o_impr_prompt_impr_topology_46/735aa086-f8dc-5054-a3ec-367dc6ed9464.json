  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and then determine how many trips the farmer's truck will require to carry this amount, given the truck's capacity.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the total weight:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight for each type of feed:**\n   \n   - **Sugar cubes:**  \n     Number of boxes = 20  \n     Weight per box = 10 pounds  \n     Total weight = 20 boxes * 10 pounds/box = 200 pounds  \n\n   - **Carrots:**  \n     Number of bags = 40  \n     Weight per bag = 120 pounds  \n     Total weight = 40 bags * 120 pounds/bag = 4800 pounds  \n\n   - **Hay:**  \n     Number of bales = 420  \n     Weight per bale = 750 pounds  \n     Total weight = 420 bales * 750 pounds/bale = 315000 pounds  \n\n   - **Oats:**  \n     Number of sacks = 200  \n     Weight per sack = 650 pounds  \n     Total weight = 200 sacks * 650 pounds/sack = 130000 pounds  \n\n2. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed combined:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 200 \\text{ pounds (sugar)} + 4800 \\text{ pounds (carrots)} + 315000 \\text{ pounds (hay)} + 130000 \\text{ pounds (oats)} \n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   = 450000 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of trips needed:**\n   The truck can carry 22500 pounds per trip. Therefore, the number of trips required is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of trips} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{450000 \\text{ pounds}}{22500 \\text{ pounds/trip}} \\right\\rceil\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating the division gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{450000}{22500} = 20\n   \\]\n\n   Since 450000 is exactly divisible by 22500, the number of trips needed is 20.\n\nTherefore, the farmer will need 20 trips to transport all the feed."
