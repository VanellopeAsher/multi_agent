  "problem": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, I'll go through the calculation of expenses for each type of item in Kelly's cart and then compare the total expense to her budget to determine how much money is left. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of each pack of bacon:**\n\n   - Total cost for 5 packs of bacon = $10.5\n   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10.5 / 5 = $2.1\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of chicken:**\n\n   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so the cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2.1 = $4.2\n   - Total cost for 6 packets of chicken = 6 * $4.2 = $25.2\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of strawberries:**\n\n   - Cost per pack of strawberries = $4.5\n   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 * $4.5 = $13.5\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of apples:**\n\n   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so cost per pack of apples = $4.5 / 2 = $2.25\n   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 * $2.25 = $15.75\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount spent:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Expense} = \\text{Total cost of bacon} + \\text{Total cost of chicken} + \\text{Total cost of strawberries} + \\text{Total cost of apples}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Expense} = 10.5 + 25.2 + 13.5 + 15.75 = 64.95\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the remaining budget:**\n\n   - Kelly's budget = $65\n   - Remaining budget = Budget - Total Expense = $65 - $64.95 = $0.05\n\nTherefore, Kelly has $0.05 left in her budget. \n\nWould anyone else like to discuss or verify this approach?"
