      "content": "Let's break down the problem into manageable parts to find out how many lines Sean has to memorize.\n\n1. **Lyrics for the Solo Song:**  \n   Sean's solo song has 54 lines in total.\n\n2. **First Scene:**  \n   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.  \n     Therefore, the first scene has \\( 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\) lines.  \n   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's.  \n     Thus, Sean's lines in the first scene are \\( \\frac{108}{3} = 36 \\) lines.\n\n3. **Second Scene:**  \n   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \\( 54 + 6 = 60 \\) lines.  \n   - Four-fifths of the lines are Sean's. However, because a fellow actor is absent, Sean has to memorize 15 lines.  \n     So, even though he originally had \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\) lines, due to the absence of an actor, this number is now explicitly given as 15 lines instead of calculated lines.\n\n4. **Total Lines Memorized by Sean:**  \n   Sum of lines Sean has to memorize:\n   - Lyrics to the solo song: 54 lines\n   - Lines in the first scene: 36 lines\n   - Lines in the second scene: 15 lines (as per the situation with the absent actor)\n\nAdding them up, Sean has to memorize a total of:\n\\[ 54 + 36 + 15 = 105 \\]\n\nThus, Sean has to memorize 105 lines in total."
