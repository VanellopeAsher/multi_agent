      "content": "1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - John buys:\n     - 10 bottles of scotch, costing $600 in total. This means each bottle of scotch costs $600 / 10 = $60.\n     - Twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, meaning he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n    \n2. **Finding the Cost of Cognac Per Bottle**:\n   - It is given that each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than each bottle of scotch. \n   - Therefore, the cost of each bottle of cognac = $60 (cost of scotch bottle) + 50% of $60 \n                                                      = $60 + $30 \n                                                      = $90.\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Cost Spent on Cognac**:\n   - John buys 20 bottles of cognac, with each bottle costing $90.\n   - Total cost for cognac = 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1,800.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Expenditure**:\n   - Total expenditure = Cost of scotch + Cost of cognac \n                       = $600 + $1,800 \n                       = $2,400.\n\n5. **Engage in Discussion**:\n   - The cost related to the alcohol content is not directly relevant to the total expenditure, unless additional details link it explicitly to the problem context.\n  \nThus, John spends a total of **$2,400** on everything. \n\nLet's discuss this solution approach."
