In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

To find out how much ribbon she can allocate for each present, divide the total ribbon by the total number of presents:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ribbon per present} = \\frac{\\text{Total ribbon}}{\\text{Total presents}} = \\frac{144 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ presents}} = 12 \\text{ inches per present}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Monica can allocate 12 inches of ribbon for each present's bow. \n\nLet's discuss this in case there are other considerations or factors to include."
