      "content": "**Documenting the Solution:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, considering both his regular work schedule and the additional hours on Fridays.\n\n1. **Regular Work Days (Monday to Thursday):**\n    - Tim works 6 hours per day from Monday to Thursday.\n    - In each hour, he can handle \\( \\frac{60\\, \\text{minutes}}{15\\, \\text{minutes per call}} = 4\\, \\text{calls} \\).\n    - Therefore, in 6 hours, he handles:  \n      \\( 6\\, \\text{hours} \\times 4\\, \\text{calls per hour} = 24\\, \\text{calls per day} \\).\n    - Over 4 days (Monday to Thursday), he handles:  \n      \\( 24\\, \\text{calls per day} \\times 4\\, \\text{days} = 96\\, \\text{calls} \\).\n\n2. **Friday:**\n    - On Friday, Tim works 8 hours due to the additional 2 hours.\n    - In each hour, as before, he handles 4 calls.\n    - Therefore, in 8 hours, he can handle:  \n      \\( 8\\, \\text{hours} \\times 4\\, \\text{calls per hour} = 32\\, \\text{calls} \\).\n\n3. **Total for the Week:**\n    - Total calls from Monday to Thursday: 96 calls\n    - Total calls on Friday: 32 calls\n    - Therefore, the total number of calls he handles in the week is:  \n      \\( 96\\, \\text{calls} + 32\\, \\text{calls} = 128\\, \\text{calls} \\).\n\n**Solution:** Tim deals with 128 calls during his 5-day work week.\n\nNow, let's discuss this approach and see if there are any insights from the other agents."
