      "content": "**Document Your Solution:**\n\nTo find out the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to first determine how many rows he can plant for each type of tulip (red, blue, and yellow).\n\n1. **Red Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 6 red tulips per row.\n   - He has 36 red tulips.\n   - Number of red tulip rows = \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Blue Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips per row.\n   - He has 24 blue tulips.\n   - Number of blue tulip rows = \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\).\n\n3. **Yellow Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 5 yellow tulips per row.\n   - He has 30 yellow tulips.\n   - Number of yellow tulip rows = \\( \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\).\n\n**Arrangement Pattern:**\n- Jackson plants rows in the order of red, yellow, and blue.\n- For each combination of a red and blue row, there is a yellow row in between, i.e., Red -> Yellow -> Blue.\n\n**Total Rows:**\n- As calculated, there are 6 red rows, 3 blue rows, and 6 yellow rows.\n- The yellow rows are placed between red and blue rows, for each pair of (Red -> Yellow -> Blue), the yellow rows add up.\n\nAs we can see from the pattern, for simplicity:\n- We'll have (Red -> Yellow -> Blue) = 3 sets.\n- This results in 3 yellow rows used up which are between each of these sets.\n- Remaining yellow rows = Total yellow rows - Intervening yellow rows = 6 - 3 = 3\n\nIncluding these repetitive rows of yellow:\n- Red rows = 6\n- Blue rows = 3\n- Yellow intervening rows = 3 (one in between each Red -> Blue sequence)\n- Additional yellow rows = 3\n\nThus, after following the intervening rules(stringent requirement laid out to separate any two colors immediately) and adding any separate extra yellow rows, we see the flower layout embedding altogether down this order should visually appear as another:\n\n- Red -> Yellow -> Blue -> Red -> Yellow -> Blue -> Red -> Yellow -> Blue -> Red -> Yellow -> Blue -> Red -> Yellow\n\nThus the total number of rows received by Jackson in his garden featuring all colors(if the last single color order doesn't pair will not individually stand out without another proceeding color constraint):\n- There will be 3 batch set runs of (Red -> Yellow -> Blue) + then the remaining Red -> Yellow only\n- Resulting ultimately in a conclusion-paired layout.\n\nTherefore, the total rows altogether so perfectly calculated simply through regrouping as follows:\n\n\\[\n6 (\\text{red rows}) + 3 (\\text{blue rows}) + 6 (\\text{yellow rows}) = 15 \\text{ total rows.}\n\\]\n\nConclusively, the full gardenage layout displays 15 neatly nestled orderly tulip rows bearing this arrangement."

For each pair of red and blue rows, a yellow row is needed between them. There are no explicit restrictions beyond this. Thus, for each blue row completed, a yellow row intervenes, implying direct pair growing setups. This accounts for the need in the same direct sequential arrangement applied multidimensionally composite structure arrangements.\n\nFinally, the total rows:\n- Red rows: 6\n- Blue rows: 3\n- Yellow Rows: 6\n\nTotal: \\( 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\)\n\nSince the blue groups orders aligning straightforwardly:\n\nThus, the correct total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{15}**"
