      "content": "To determine how many people Billy helps per hour, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the Total Days Available:**\n   March has 31 days and April 19 days, thus:\n   \\[\n   31 + 19 = 50 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Days Billy Takes Off:**\n   Billy takes 20% of these 50 days off:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ days off}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Working Days:**\n   Subtract the days off from the total days:\n   \\[\n   50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ working days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Hours Worked:**\n   Billy works 3 hours per day, so over 40 days, he works:\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 3 = 120 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Number of People Helped Per Hour:**\n   Billy helps 240 people in total. To find out how many people he helps per hour, divide the total number of people by the total number of hours he works:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{240 \\text{ people}}{120 \\text{ hours}} = 2 \\text{ people per hour}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Billy helps 2 people per hour. Now let's discuss this solution."
