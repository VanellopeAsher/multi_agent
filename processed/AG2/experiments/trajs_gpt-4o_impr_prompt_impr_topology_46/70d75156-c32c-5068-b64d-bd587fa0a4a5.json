      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Oranges Mrs. Harrington Bought**:  \n   Let's say Mrs. Harrington bought `x` boxes of oranges. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she initially had `20x` oranges in total.\n\n2. **Oranges Given Away**:  \n   Mrs. Harrington gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. In total, she gave away `2 + 2 = 4` boxes of oranges.  \n   Therefore, the number of oranges given away = `4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Oranges**:  \n   After giving oranges to her mom and sister, Mrs. Harrington has `20x - 80` oranges left.\n\n4. **Mrs. Harringtonâ€™s Share of Oranges**:  \n   She kept 1/4 of the oranges that remained after giving to her mom and sister:  \n   Oranges she kept = \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\\).\n\n5. **Oranges Mrs. Harrington Sold**:  \n   The rest, which she did not keep, were sold. Oranges sold = Total remaining oranges - Oranges kept.\n\n   Let's substitute the formulas:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges Kept} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\n   \\]\n\n   Oranges sold equals:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges Sold} = (20x - 80) - \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this, the oranges sold are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges Sold} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\n   \\]\n\nThis formulation gives us the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold based on the number of boxes `x` she initially bought. If you provide the specific number of boxes she purchased, we can compute the exact number of oranges sold."

      "content": "However, to proceed with our calculation, let's assume Mrs. Harrington initially bought a specific number of boxes, say `x` boxes, which we can set to a specific number if given.

      "content": "I will write the Python code using SymPy to calculate the number of oranges sold based on our assumptions and simplifications. Let's use SymPy to handle symbolic computation, and once a specific value for `x` is provided, we can substitute it easily.\n\n```python\n# your code here\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the symbol for the number of boxes\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Each box contains 20 oranges\noranges_per_box = 20\n\n# Total oranges initially bought\ninitial_oranges = oranges_per_box * x\n\n# Oranges given away (4 boxes)\noranges_given_away = 4 * oranges_per_box\n\n# Remaining oranges after giving away\nremaining_oranges = initial_oranges - oranges_given_away\n\n# Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges\nkept_oranges = remaining_oranges / 4\n\n# Oranges sold (remainder)\nsold_oranges = remaining_oranges - kept_oranges\n\n# Simplify expression for oranges sold\nsold_oranges_expr = sold_oranges.simplify()\n\n# Output the symbolic expression\nprint(f'Number of oranges sold in terms of x: {sold_oranges_expr}')\n\n# If a specific number of boxes (like x = 10) is known, you can compute exact value as follows:\n# number_of_boxes = 10\n# oranges_sold = sold_oranges_expr.subs(x, number_of_boxes)\n# print(f'Number of oranges sold when x is {number_of_boxes}: {oranges_sold}')\n```\n\nThis code helps us understand how the number of oranges sold is calculated as an expression dependent on `x`. When a specific value of `x` is available, simply substitute it in the code to find the exact result."
