We need to determine the length of each piece in inches.\n\n- Agent Problem Solver calculated the length of each piece by first converting the total length of the wire from feet to inches (1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = 48 inches) and then dividing by the number of pieces, obtaining 6 inches per piece.\n- Agent Code Executor wrote a Python program to simulate the same calculation and obtained a result of 6.0 inches. The code correctly handled unit conversion and integer division.\n\nBoth approaches agree on the solution. Therefore, I will declare the final solution.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{6}**"
