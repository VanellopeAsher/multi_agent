In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Therefore, the price of a half-gallon jar is \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Number of Jars Purchased**: \n   - Cecelia purchased 10 one-gallon jars.\n   - Cecelia purchased 16 half-gallon jars.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Cost for Each Jar Type**: \n   - Total cost for the one-gallon jars:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of one-gallon jars} = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n   - Total cost for the half-gallon jars:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of half-gallon jars} = 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Sum the Total Costs**:\n   - The total expenditure is the sum of the costs for the one-gallon and half-gallon jars.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Cecelia expended a total of $98 on purchasing the jars. Let's discuss if there are other insights or checks to ensure correctness."
