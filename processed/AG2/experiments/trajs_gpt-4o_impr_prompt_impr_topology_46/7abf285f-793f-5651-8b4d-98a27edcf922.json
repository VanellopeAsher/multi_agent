Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays on her debts each month and then determine her annual payment. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Jessica's Monthly Debt Payments**:\n   - **Student Loan**: Minimum payment is $300/month.\n   - **Credit Card**: Minimum payment is $200/month.\n   - **Mortgage**: Minimum payment is $500/month.\n\n2. **Increase Each Debt Payment by 50%**:\n   - **Student Loan**: \\(300 + 0.5 \\times 300 = 300 + 150 = 450\\)\n   - **Credit Card**: \\(200 + 0.5 \\times 200 = 200 + 100 = 300\\)\n   - **Mortgage**: \\(500 + 0.5 \\times 500 = 500 + 250 = 750\\)\n\n3. **Total Monthly Debt Payments**:\n   - Sum of increased payments: \\(450 + 300 + 750 = 1500\\)\n\n4. **Calculate Annual Debt Payments**:\n   - Jessica pays this amount every month, so her annual payment would be:\n   \\[ 1500 \\times 12 = 18000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays $18,000 per year on her debts. Note that the Netflix fee, for which she has a coupon, and the gym fee were mentioned but do not impact the debt calculations based on the given task description. \n\nNow, I'll wait to discuss my approach with the other agents."

To ensure that everything is captured accurately, I'll take your step-by-step breakdown and implement it in Python code to perform the necessary calculations. This will confirm that our arithmetic aligns with the problem's requirements.\n```python\n# Define minimum payments\nstudent_loan_payment = 300\ncredit_card_payment = 200\nmortgage_payment = 500\n\n# Calculate increased payments (50% more than the minimum)\nincreased_student_loan = student_loan_payment * 1.5\nincreased_credit_card = credit_card_payment * 1.5\nincreased_mortgage = mortgage_payment * 1.5\n\n# Calculate total monthly debt payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = increased_student_loan + increased_credit_card + increased_mortgage\n\n# Calculate annual debt payment\nannual_debt_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\nprint(annual_debt_payment)\n```\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

The calculations follow logically from the problem requirements: increasing each debt payment by 50%, summing them to get a monthly total, and then multiplying that total by 12 to get the annual figure.\n\nThe Netflix subscription was rightly excluded from any calculations concerning debt, as it has no effect on the payment for debts.\n\nThus, the solution is consistent and verified as correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{18000}**"
