Calculate Gerald's earnings for the week:**\n\n- Gerald earns $30 per day.\n- There are 7 days in a week.\n\nTherefore, his total earnings for the week are:\n\\[ \\text{Earnings per week} = 30 \\text{(dollars/day)} \\times 7 \\text{(days/week)} = 210 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\n**2. Calculate the amount Gerald spent:**\n\n- Total earnings for the week are $210.\n- He saved $110.\n\nThe amount spent is:\n\\[ \\text{Amount spent} = \\text{Total earnings} - \\text{Savings} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Amount spent} = 210 \\text{ dollars} - 110 \\text{ dollars} = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, Gerald spent $100."
