Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate Boating and Swimming Time:**\n   - John spent 6.6 hours boating.\n   - He spent half of the boating time swimming: \\( \\frac{6.6}{2} = 3.3 \\) hours swimming.\n   - Total time spent boating and swimming is \\( 6.6 + 3.3 = 9.9 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the Time Spent Watching Shows:**\n   - John watched 3 shows, each lasting 2.5 hours.\n   - Total time spent watching shows: \\( 3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Determine the Total Time Spent, Using the Information that Show Watching is 30%:**\n   - The shows took 30% of his total time, so we calculate total time \\( T \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   7.5 = 0.3 \\times T\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} = 25 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing took 40% of his total time.\n   - Time spent sightseeing: \\( 0.4 \\times 25 = 10 \\) hours.\n\nTherefore, John spent 10 hours sightseeing."
