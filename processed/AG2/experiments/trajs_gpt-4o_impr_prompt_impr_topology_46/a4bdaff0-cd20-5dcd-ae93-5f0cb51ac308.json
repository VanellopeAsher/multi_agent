      "content": "To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she chooses to pay 50% more than the minimum for each of her debts, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minimum Monthly Payments**:\n   - **Student Loans**: $3000/month\n   - **Credit Card**: $2000/month\n   - **Mortgage**: $5000/month\n\n2. **Calculate 50% More Than the Minimum for Each Debt**:\n   - For the student loans: 50% of $3000 is $1500, so she pays $3000 + $1500 = $4500/month.\n   - For the credit card: 50% of $2000 is $1000, so she pays $2000 + $1000 = $3000/month.\n   - For the mortgage: 50% of $5000 is $2500, so she pays $5000 + $2500 = $7500/month.\n\n3. **Determine the Total Monthly Payment**:\n   - Total monthly payment = $4500 (student loans) + $3000 (credit card) + $7500 (mortgage) = $15000/month.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Annual Payment**:\n   - Total annual payment = $15000/month * 12 months = $180,000/year.\n\nTherefore, if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum required for each of her debts, she will pay $180,000 per year."

Both agents used the correct formula to compute the enhanced monthly payments and then annualized them.\n\nThe student loan, credit card, and mortgage minimum payments resulted in monthly payments of $4500, $3000, and $7500, respectively, when increased by 50%. Summing these provides a monthly payment of $15,000, and multiplying by 12 months gives the annual figure of $180,000.\n\nThus, the verified solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{180000}**"
