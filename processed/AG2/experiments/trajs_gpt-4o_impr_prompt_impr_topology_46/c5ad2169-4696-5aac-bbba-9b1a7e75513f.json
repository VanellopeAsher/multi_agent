Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Fish tank**:  \n   Scarlett bought the fish tank for $10.00.  \n\n2. **Packets of stones**:  \n   She purchased two packets of stones, each costing $2.50.  \n   Total cost for stones = \\(2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\\).\n\n3. **Coral pieces**:  \n   Scarlett bought three coral pieces, each priced at $2.00.  \n   Total cost for coral pieces = \\(3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00\\).\n\n4. **Fish**:  \n   She bought 20 fish, each priced at $0.50.  \n   Total cost for fish = \\(20 \\times 0.50 = 10.00\\).\n\n5. **Fish food**:  \n   The packet of fish food cost $2.00.\n\nFinally, to get the total amount Scarlett spent, add up all these costs:  \nTotal amount spent = $10.00 (fish tank) + $5.00 (stones) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food).\n\nThus, the total cost = $33.00.\n\nScarlett spent a total of $33.00."
