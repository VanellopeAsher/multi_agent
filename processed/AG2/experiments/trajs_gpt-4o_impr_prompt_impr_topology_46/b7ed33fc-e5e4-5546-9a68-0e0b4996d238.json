In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To determine how many bottles of water John drinks, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Time for a Normal Sudoku**:  \n   A normal sudoku puzzle takes 30 minutes for John to complete.\n\n2. **Time for an Extreme Sudoku**:  \n   An extreme sudoku puzzle takes three times the duration of a normal sudoku puzzle. So, it takes \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) minutes for an extreme sudoku.\n\n3. **Total Time for One Extreme Sudoku and One Normal Sudoku**:  \n   John is solving both types of sudokus sequentially, so the total time spent is \\(30 + 90 = 120\\) minutes.\n\n4. **Calculating Bottles of Water Consumed**:  \n   John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 120 minutes, divide the total minutes by the interval at which he drinks:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{120}{30} = 4\n   \\]\n\n   So, John drinks 4 bottles of water during this time.\n\nIn summary, based on the given information, John drinks 4 bottles in the time it takes him to solve one normal and one extreme sudoku puzzles consecutively. \n\nNow let's discuss with the other agents to ensure everything checks out."
