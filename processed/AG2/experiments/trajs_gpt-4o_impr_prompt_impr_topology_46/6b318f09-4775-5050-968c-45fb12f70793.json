In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate the total number of people from the families invited:\n   - There are 12 families with 6 people each: \n     \\[\n     12 \\times 6 = 72 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n   - There are 15 families with 4 people each:\n     \\[\n     15 \\times 4 = 60 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the total number of people invited:\n   \\[\n   72 + 60 = 132 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of people who couldn't attend due to illness:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the number of people who had previous commitments:\n   - 1/4 of those who couldn't attend due to illness:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n\n5. Calculate the total number of people who couldn't attend:\n   \\[\n   16 + 4 = 20 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n6. Calculate the number of people who will show up for the party by subtracting those who couldn't attend from the total invited:\n   \\[\n   132 - 20 = 112 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\nSo, 112 people will show up for Martha's party."
