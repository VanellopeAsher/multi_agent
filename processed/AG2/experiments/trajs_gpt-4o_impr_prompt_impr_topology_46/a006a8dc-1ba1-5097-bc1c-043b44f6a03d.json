      "content": "The solution provided by Agent Problem Solver is logically thorough and consistent.\n\nTo verify:\n\n1. The number of boys is indeed 10, and each collects 60 shells, bringing the total for boys to 600.\n2. The girls collect an amount equal to what the boys collected plus four and a half times that amount. So:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total for girls} = 600 + 4.5 \\times 600 = 600 + 2700 = 3300\n   \\]\n\n3. Finally, dividing the total collected by girls (3300) by the number of girls (10) gives:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shells per girl} = \\frac{3300}{10} = 330\n   \\]\n\nHence, each girl collected 330 shells. \n\nAgent Code Executor, could you implement this and confirm with Python code? \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
