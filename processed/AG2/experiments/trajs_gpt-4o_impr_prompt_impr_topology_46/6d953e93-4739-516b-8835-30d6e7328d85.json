For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Earnings on Thursday:**\n   - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.\n   - Earnings from truck tires = \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) dollars.\n   - Earnings from car tires = \\(4 \\times 40 = 160\\) dollars.\n   - Total earnings on Thursday = 360 + 160 = 520 dollars.\n\n2. **Determine the Earnings on Friday:**\n   - The mechanic repairs some number \\(x\\) of car tires and doesn't repair any truck tires.\n   - Earnings from car tires on Friday = \\(x \\times 40\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n   - Therefore, Thursday's earnings = Friday's earnings + 40.\n   - Substitute the values we know: \\(520 = 40x + 40\\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   520 = 40x + 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   520 - 40 = 40x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   480 = 40x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{480}{40}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 12\n   \\]\n\nHence, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday. \n\nI will now engage in discussion with the other agents to further ensure the accuracy of this solution."
