Calculate the cost of non-food items and apply the 10% tax to these.\n4. Sum all the costs to find the total cost.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Food and Non-Food Items**\n   - **Food Items**: Milk and eggs\n   - **Non-Food Items**: Light bulbs, cups, roach traps\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost of Food Items:**\n   - Milk: $2\n   - Eggs: $3\n   - Total cost for food items = $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost of Non-Food Items Before Tax:**\n   - Light bulbs: $3\n   - Cups: $3\n   - Roach traps: $4\n   - Total cost for non-food items before tax = $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10\n\n4. **Apply 10% Tax to Non-Food Items:**\n   - Tax on non-food items = 10% of $10 = $1\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of food items + Cost of non-food items + Tax\n   - Total cost = $5 (food items) + $10 (non-food items) + $1 (tax) = $16\n\nThe total cost of all items, including the tax on non-food items, is $16."
