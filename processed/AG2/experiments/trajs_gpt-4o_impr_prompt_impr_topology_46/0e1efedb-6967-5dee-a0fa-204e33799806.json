Start by adding the cost of the pots and the garden soil:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of pots} = 19 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of garden soil} = 26 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost before discount} = 19 + 26 = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Apply the discount voucher:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount spent after discount} = 45 - 7 = 38 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, your mother spent a total of $38 at the gardening store."
