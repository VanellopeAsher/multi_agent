      "content": "To calculate the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing, we need to break down the costs component by component and then add them together.\n\n1. **Calculate the Service Fee:**  \n   Patty's Plumbing charges a flat service fee of $40 for every house call. This is a fixed cost, so for this job, the service fee is $40.\n\n2. **Calculate the Labor Cost:**  \n   The labor is charged at $35 per hour or fraction of an hour. For the given job, the time spent on labor is 2.25 hours. Since Patty's Plumbing charges for every fraction of an hour as a full hour, we need to round up the hours to the next whole number:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rounded Hours} = \\lceil 2.25 \\rceil = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   So, the labor cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Labor Cost} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$35/\\text{hour} = \\$105\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Parts:**  \n   The cost of parts for this job is directly given as $60.\n\n4. **Total Amount Billed:**  \n   Finally, add the service fee, labor cost, and cost of parts together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Amount Billed} = \\$40 + \\$105 + \\$60 = \\$205\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing for this particular job is $205."
