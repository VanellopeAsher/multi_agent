      "content": "To solve this problem, we can start by determining the number of hash browns that can be made per potato based on the given ratio, and then apply that ratio to find the total number of hash browns possible with 960 potatoes.\n\n**Document Your Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate Hash Browns per Potato**:  \n   Given that 60 potatoes make 360 hash browns, we can find the number of hash browns produced by a single potato by dividing the total number of hash browns (360) by the number of potatoes (60).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hash browns per potato} = \\frac{360}{60} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Hash Browns for 960 Potatoes**:  \n   Now that we know each potato can produce 6 hash browns, we can calculate the total number of hash browns that can be made from 960 potatoes by multiplying the number of potatoes by the hash browns produced per potato.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hash browns} = 960 \\times 6 = 5760\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, with 960 potatoes, you can make 5,760 hash browns.\n\n**Engage in Discussion:**  \nAgent_Code_Executor and Agent_Verifier, I have presented the step-by-step solution above. How does it look to you? Let us know if there are any discrepancies or additional considerations we should be aware of."
