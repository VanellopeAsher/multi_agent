Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Jacket and Shoes**:  \n   - One jacket costs $120.\n   - Each pair of shoes costs $100, and she wants 2 pairs.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \\( 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\).\n   - The overall cost for both the jacket and the shoes combined is \\( 120 + 200 = 320 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Earnings from Babysitting**:  \n   - Sara babysits 10 times, earning $5 each time.\n   - Her total earnings from babysitting are \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Sara's Current Savings**:  \n   - Sara had initially saved $100.\n   - Adding her babysitting earnings, her total savings are \\( 100 + 50 = 150 \\).\n\n4. **Determine Remaining Money Needed**:  \n   - Sara needs $320 in total for the jacket and shoes.\n   - With $150 already saved, she still needs \\( 320 - 150 = 170 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Times She Must Mow the Lawn**:  \n   - She earns $10 each time she mows the lawn.\n   - To cover the remaining $170, she must mow the lawn \\( \\frac{170}{10} = 17 \\) times.\n\nThus, Sara needs to mow the lawn 17 times to afford the jacket and shoes."

After accounting for Sara's savings and babysitting earnings, which total $150, it was identified that Sara still needs $170. Since she earns $10 per lawn mowing session, she needs to mow the lawn \\( \\frac{170}{10} = 17 \\) times to make up the difference.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor** also calculated that Sara needs to mow the lawn 17 times and verified this through a Python code execution, yielding the same result.\n\nBoth solutions align perfectly, affirming the correctness of the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{17}**"
