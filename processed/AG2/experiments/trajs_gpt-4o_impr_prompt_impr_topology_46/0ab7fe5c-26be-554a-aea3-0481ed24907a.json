I will translate the outlined solution into Python code to see if it leads us to the same result. \n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Calculate the number of red and blue tulips Jackson buys.\n2. Determine how many rows he can plant with each.\n3. Sum up the rows for both red and blue tulips to find the total number of rows.\n\nLet me compute these steps. \n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of tulips Jackson buys\nred_tulips = 3.6 * 10\nblue_tulips = 2.4 * 10\n\n# Calculate the number of rows needed for each type of tulip\nred_rows = red_tulips / 6\nblue_rows = blue_tulips / 8\n\n# Total number of rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
