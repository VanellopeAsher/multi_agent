      "content": "**Document Your Solution:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken meal:**  \n   The cost of one chicken meal is $12.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the milk packs:**  \n   Marie bought 5 packs of milk, each costing $3.50. So, the total cost for milk is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3.50 = 17.50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**  \n   Marie bought 4 apples, each costing $1.50. So, the total cost for apples is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 1.50 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the total cost of these items (excluding the pizza):**  \n   The total cost for the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 17.50 + 6 = 35.50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the remaining amount spent on pizza:**  \n   Marie paid a total of $52.50. Therefore, the amount spent on pizza is:\n   \\[\n   52.50 - 35.50 = 17 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of pizza boxes:**  \n   Each box of pizza costs $8.50. So, the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \\text{ boxes}\n   \\]\n\nMarie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. \n\nPlease proceed with the discussion to verify this solution."

By using subtraction to find the leftover amount spent on pizza and then dividing the resultant amount by the cost per box of pizza, Agent Problem Solver effectively calculates the number of pizzas ordered. \n\nTo ensure the accuracy of this solution, I will verify by performing the calculations using Python code. This will confirm that the arithmetic was done correctly and ensure accuracy.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

The calculations provided by both agents show that Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. \n\nThe steps were as follows:\n- Calculate the cost for each category of items (chicken meal, milk, apples).\n- Deduct these from the total amount paid to find the amount spent on pizzas.\n- Divide this remaining amount by the cost per pizza box to determine how many boxes she ordered.\n\nAll calculations appear accurate based on the original problem statement.
