Therefore, the volume of water on the second day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume on Day 2} = 2 \\times 4000 \\text{ gallons} = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Account for the Third Day Addition**: On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow. Thus, the volume of water on the third day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume on Day 3} = 8000 \\text{ gallons} + 6000 \\text{ gallons} = 14000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Volume on the Third Day**: Therefore, the total volume of water flowing through that point of the river on the third day is 14,000 gallons.\n\nThis solution is based on sequentially applying the given changes in water volume from day to day."
