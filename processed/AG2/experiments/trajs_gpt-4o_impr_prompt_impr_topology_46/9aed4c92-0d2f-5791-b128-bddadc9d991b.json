Create an equation to find out how many days, \\( x \\), he needs to work to afford the bike.\n\nLet's formulate it:\nMark's total money after \\( x \\) days can be expressed as: \n\\[ \\text{Total money} = \\text{Initial money} + (\\text{Daily earnings} \\times \\text{Number of days}) \\]\n\\[ 50.5 + 12.5x \\]\n\nWe need this to be equal to or greater than the cost of the bike, which is $300.5:\n\\[ 50.5 + 12.5x \\geq 300.5 \\]\n\nLet's solve this inequality for \\( x \\).\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
