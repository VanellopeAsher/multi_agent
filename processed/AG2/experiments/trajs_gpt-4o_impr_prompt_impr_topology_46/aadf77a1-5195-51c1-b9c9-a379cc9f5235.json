In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this, let's establish an equation based on the information provided.\n\n1. First, identify what we know:\n    - Medium t-shirts (M) contribute 4 square feet each, and there are 8 of them.\n    - Large t-shirts (L) contribute 6 square feet each, and there are 6 of them.\n    - We need to find out how many small t-shirts (S) Octavia used, and each small t-shirt contributes 3 square feet.\n\n2. Set up the equation for the total area of the quilt:\n   \\[\n   3S + 4M + 6L = 101\n   \\]\n\n3. Plug in the values for M and L:\n   \\[\n   3S + 4(8) + 6(6) = 101\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   3S + 32 + 36 = 101\n   \\]\n\n5. Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   3S + 68 = 101\n   \\]\n\n6. Solve for S by subtracting 68 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3S = 33\n   \\]\n\n7. Divide both sides by 3 to find S:\n   \\[\n   S = 11\n   \\]\n\nThus, Octavia used 11 small t-shirts to make the quilt. \n\nNow, let's discuss this approach for accuracy with other agents."
