      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of Karate classes Manny can miss before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.\n\nHere's how we approach it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Total Cost of Karate Classes**: \n   Manny signed up for Karate classes costing $60.\n\n2. **Number of Total Karate Classes**: \n   There are 10 Karate classes in total.\n\n3. **Cost per Class Calculation**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per class} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Number of Classes Attended}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify Maximum Acceptable Cost Per Class**: \n   The cost per class must not exceed $10.\n\n5. **Set Up Inequality**: \n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of classes Manny attends. Then, the inequality representing the condition is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve the Inequality**: \n   To find \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the inequality by \\( x \\) and divide both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   60 \\leq 10x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 6\n   \\]\n\n   This implies Manny must attend at least 6 classes.\n\n7. **Determine Classes Manny Can Miss**:\n   If there are 10 classes total, and Manny must attend at least 6 classes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Classes Manny can miss} = 10 - 6 = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10."
