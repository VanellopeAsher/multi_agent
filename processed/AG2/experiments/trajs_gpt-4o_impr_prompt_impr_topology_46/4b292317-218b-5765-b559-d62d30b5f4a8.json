      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the length of the final cuts Marty makes with his ribbon. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Cut of the Ribbon**: Marty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon, which needs to be divided into 40 equal parts. \n    - To find the length of each of these parts, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts: \n      \\[\n      \\text{Length of each part} = \\frac{10,000 \\text{ mm}}{40} = 250 \\text{ mm}\n      \\]\n    So, each of the 40 parts is 250 millimeters long.\n\n2. **Second Set of Cuts**: Each of these 250-millimeter parts must be divided further into 50 equal parts.\n    - To find the length of each final cut, we divide the length of each 250-millimeter part by 50:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Length of each final part} = \\frac{250 \\text{ mm}}{50} = 5 \\text{ mm}\n      \\]\n    Therefore, each final cut is 5 millimeters long.\n\nSo, each of the final cuts Marty makes will be 5 millimeters long."
