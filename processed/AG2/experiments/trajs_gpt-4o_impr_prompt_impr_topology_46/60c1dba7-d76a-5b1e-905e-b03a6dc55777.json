      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's assign variables to each person's card count:\n\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of cards Becca has.\n- Let \\( S \\) be the number of cards Smendrick has.\n- Let \\( P \\) be the number of cards PJ has.\n\nFrom the problem, we can establish the following relationships:\n\n1. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick: \n   \\[\n   B = S + 15\n   \\]\n\n2. Smendrick has 4 times the number of cards that PJ has:\n   \\[\n   S = 4P\n   \\]\n\n3. The total number of cards is 447:\n   \\[\n   B + S + P = 447\n   \\]\n\nWith these equations, we can solve for the number of cards each person has. Let's substitute the expressions for \\( B \\) and \\( S \\) in terms of \\( P \\) into the total equation:\n\nSubstitute \\( B = S + 15 \\) into the total:\n\\[\n(S + 15) + S + P = 447\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( S = 4P \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n(4P + 15) + 4P + P = 447\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n9P + 15 = 447\n\\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\\[\n9P = 432\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\\[\nP = 48\n\\]\n\nNow we know \\( P = 48 \\). Use this to find \\( S \\) and \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\nS = 4P = 4 \\times 48 = 192\n\\]\n\n\\[\nB = S + 15 = 192 + 15 = 207\n\\]\n\nSo, Becca has 207 cards."
