The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:\n   \\[\n   P + Pa + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul is 18 years older than Jean:\n   \\[\n   Pa = J + 18\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean’s age:\n   \\[\n   P = Pa + J\n   \\]\n\nWith these equations, we can substitute equation (2) into equation (3):\n\n\\[\nP = (J + 18) + J = 2J + 18\n\\]\n\nNow we’ll use this expression for Peter's age in equation (1):\n\n\\[\n2J + 18 + J + J = 100\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4J + 18 = 100\n\\]\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4J = 82\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to find Jean’s age:\n\n\\[\nJ = 20.5\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( J = 20.5 \\) into the expression for Peter’s age, \\( P = 2J + 18 \\):\n\n\\[\nP = 2(20.5) + 18\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = 41 + 18\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = 59\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Peter is 59 years old.\n\nNext, I will discuss this solution with the other agents to confirm its accuracy."

Let's review the problem again to ensure we have interpreted the information correctly.\n\nI realized there was an oversight in the transcription of the names in my initial problem statement translation:\n- Paul is 18 years older than \"John,\" not \"Jean.\"\n- The combined age of \"Peter, Paul, and Jean\" should include John instead of Jean, as Peter's age equation relied on an incorrect assumption. The problem should involve Peter, Paul, and John.\n\nHere's the corrected approach using the original written equations:\n\n1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100. Correct the names:\n   \\[\n   P + Pa + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul is 18 years older than John:\n   \\[\n   Pa = J + 18\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:\n   \\[\n   P = Pa + J\n   \\]\n\nWith these equations set up correctly, my next move will be to correct the computation based on these corrected interpretations. \n\nWould it be best to reexamine the algebra setup itself or re-run the code with possible changes?"
