      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many OLED TVs Samwell's appliance store sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Fraction of TVs Sold that are Not OLED TVs**: First, identify the fractions of TVs sold that are smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs. Then, sum these fractions to determine the portion of TVs that are not OLED.\n\n    - Smart TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n    - Analog TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n    - Projection TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\n2. **Sum the Fractions of Non-OLED TVs**: Add the fractions of the TVs that are not OLED.\n\n    \\[\n    \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{5}\n    \\]\n\n   To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 8, and 5 is 40. Convert each fraction:\n\n    - Smart TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10}{40}\\)\n    - Analog TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{5}{40}\\)\n    - Projection TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{8}{40}\\)\n\n   Sum them:\n\n    \\[\n    \\frac{10}{40} + \\frac{5}{40} + \\frac{8}{40} = \\frac{23}{40}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Fraction for OLED TVs**: Subtract the summed fraction of non-OLED TVs from 1 to find the fraction of OLED TVs.\n\n   Fraction of OLED TVs:\n\n    \\[\n    1 - \\frac{23}{40} = \\frac{17}{40}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of OLED TVs Sold**: Multiply the total number of TVs sold by the fraction of OLED TVs:\n\n   Total TVs = 40\n\n   Number of OLED TVs = \\(\\frac{17}{40} \\times 40 = 17\\)\n\nTherefore, Samwell's store sold 17 OLED TVs."
