In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Since it was 3 inches at the end of the first week, it grows to \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches by the end of the second week.\n\n3. **Third Week**:\n   - We know the beanstalk is 10 inches tall by the end of the third week.\n   - It was 6 inches at the end of the second week.\n   - The growth during the third week is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Height at the end of the third week} - \\text{Height at the end of the second week} = 10 \\text{ inches} - 6 \\text{ inches} = 4 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the beanstalk grew 4 inches during the third week."
