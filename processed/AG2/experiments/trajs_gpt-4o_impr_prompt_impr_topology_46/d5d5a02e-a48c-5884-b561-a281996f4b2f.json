Let \\( D \\) be Emil's dad's current age.\n3. Let \\( B \\) be Emil's brother's current age.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- In 5 years (when Emil turns 26), he will be half the age of his dad. Thus, his dad's age in 5 years will be \\( 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\).\n  \\[\n  D + 5 = 52 \\implies D = 47\n  \\]\n\n- In 5 years, Emil will also be twice as old as his brother. Thus, his brother's age in 5 years will be \\( \\frac{26}{2} = 13 \\).\n  \\[\n  B + 5 = 13 \\implies B = 8\n  \\]\n\nNow to find the sum of Emil's dad's current age and brother's current age:\n\\[\nD + B = 47 + 8 = 55\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 55."

Here's a brief check of the logic:\n\n- Emil will be 26 in 5 years.\n- At that time, he will be half the age of his dad and twice the age of his brother.\n- Setting up the equations based on these conditions and solving them reveals that:\n  - Emil's dad's current age is 47.\n  - Emil's brother's current age is 8.\n\nTherefore, the sum of their current ages is \\( 47 + 8 = 55 \\).\n\nBased on this consistent reasoning and verification of both agents' results, the solution is confirmed.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{55}**"
