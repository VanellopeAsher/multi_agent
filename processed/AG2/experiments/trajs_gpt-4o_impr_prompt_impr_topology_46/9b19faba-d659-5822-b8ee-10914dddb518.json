On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pies sold on each day before calculating the total revenue generated over the three days. Letâ€™s break down the problem day by day:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Saturday:\n- **Gingerbread Sold**: Let \\( G_s = 10 \\) (as given).\n- **Apple Pie Sold**: It was mentioned that Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. We'll calculate this once we find out how many apple pies were sold on Sunday.\n\n#### Sunday:\n- **Gingerbread Sold**: It was mentioned that on Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Thus, \\( G_{sun} = G_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \\).\n- **Apple Pie Sold**: \\( A_{sun} = 15 \\) (as given).\n\nSince Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than Sunday:\n- **Apple Pie on Saturday**: \\( A_s = A_{sun} - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \\).\n\n#### Monday:\n- **Gingerbread Sold**: \\( G_m = 2 \\) (as given).\n- **Apple Pie Sold**: \\( A_m = 4 \\) (as given).\n\n### Revenue Calculation:\nNow, we calculate the total earnings for each type of sale.\n\n#### Prices:\n- **Cost per Gingerbread box**: $6\n- **Cost per Apple Pie box**: $15\n\n#### Total Gingerbread Earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Gingerbread Sold} = G_s + G_{sun} + G_m = 10 + 15 + 2 = 27 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Gingerbread Earnings} = 27 \\times 6 = 162 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n#### Total Apple Pie Earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Apple Pie Sold} = A_s + A_{sun} + A_m = 11 + 15 + 4 = 30 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Apple Pie Earnings} = 30 \\times 15 = 450 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n#### Total Earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Gingerbread Earnings} + \\text{Apple Pie Earnings} = 162 + 450 = 612 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, Sunny earned a total of $612 over the three days. \n\nNow, let's discuss and verify this approach with any other agents interested."
