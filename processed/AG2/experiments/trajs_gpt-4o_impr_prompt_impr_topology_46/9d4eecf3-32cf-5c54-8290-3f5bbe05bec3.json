Therefore, Jerry's share can be calculated by subtracting Richard's and Robert's cherries from the total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jerry's cherries} = 6000 - (3000 + 2000) = 1000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the difference in cherries between Robert and Jerry:**\n   To find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000\n   \\]\n\nThus, Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry."

Jerry's share is \\(6000 - (3000 + 2000) = 1000\\) cherries.\n5. The difference between Robert and Jerry is \\(3000 - 1000 = 2000\\).\n\nEach step aligns between the Agent Problem Solver's and the Agent Code Executor's outputs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2000}**"
