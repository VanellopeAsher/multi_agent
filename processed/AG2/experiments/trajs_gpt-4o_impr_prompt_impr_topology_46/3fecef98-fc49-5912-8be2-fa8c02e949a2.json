      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of fabric required for both the comforter and the duvet cover separately, and then sum them up to determine the total fabric Jim needs.\n\n1. **Calculate the Fabric for the Comforter**:\n   - Jim needs two pieces of fabric for the comforter.\n   - The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.\n   - Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\n   - Thus, each piece of fabric should be:  \n     Length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet  \n     Width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet  \n   - The area for each piece of fabric = Length × Width = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet.\n   - Since Jim needs two pieces, the total fabric for the comforter = 2 × 80 square feet = 160 square feet.\n\n2. **Calculate the Fabric for the Duvet Cover**:\n   - The duvet cover needs one piece of fabric.\n   - The required dimensions for the duvet cover are 9 feet long by 11 feet wide.  \n   - The area of the duvet cover = 9 feet × 11 feet = 99 square feet.\n\n3. **Determine the Total Fabric Needed**:\n   - Add the fabric needed for the comforter and the duvet cover together.\n   - Total fabric = 160 square feet (for comforter) + 99 square feet (for duvet cover) = 259 square feet.\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy a total of 259 square feet of fabric."

For the comforter:\n   - Each piece requires 8 feet by 10 feet of fabric, and two pieces are necessary.\n   - Total area for the comforter: 160 square feet.\n\n2. For the duvet cover:\n   - A single piece measuring 9 feet by 11 feet is needed.\n   - Total area for the duvet cover: 99 square feet.\n\nBy adding these two areas together, the total fabric required is indeed 259 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{259}**"
