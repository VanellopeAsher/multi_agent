      "content": "To solve this problem, let's define the number of chimichangas they make on Tuesday (and Wednesday) as \\( x \\).\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:  \n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday. \n   - Since they make the same amount on Wednesday, they also make \\( x \\) chimichangas on Wednesday.\n   - On Friday, they make twice the amount made on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is \\( 2x \\).\n\n2. **Set up the Equation**:  \n   According to the problem, the total number of chimichangas made across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is 500. Thus, the equation will be:\n   \\[\n   x + x + 2x = 500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:  \n   Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   4x = 500\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   They make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.\n\nThis concludes my solution to the problem. I'll await any discussion or verification from the other agents."
