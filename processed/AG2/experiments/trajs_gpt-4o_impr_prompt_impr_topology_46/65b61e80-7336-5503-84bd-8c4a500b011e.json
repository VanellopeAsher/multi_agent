      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of eggs found by the friends of the Smith twins using the information provided:\n\n1. **Smith Twins' Findings**:\n   - Each of the Smith twins found 30 eggs.\n   - Thus, the Smith twins together found: \\(30 \\text{ eggs} + 30 \\text{ eggs} = 60 \\text{ eggs}\\).\n\n2. **Eggs Hidden but Unfound**:\n   - It's stated that all the other eggs, except 10, were found by their friends.\n   - This implies that the total eggs minus those found by the Smith twins and the 10 unfound eggs will give us the eggs found by the friends.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   - If \\(E\\) represents the total number of hidden eggs, then the equation reflecting the situation is:\n     \\[\n     (E - 10) - 60 = \\text{Eggs found by friends}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine Number of Eggs Found by Friends**:\n   - Equally, since the Smith twins found 60 eggs and 10 eggs were left unfound, the remaining in-between part is found by the friends.\n   - The number of eggs the friends found is simply:\n     \\[\n     E - 70\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solution Conclusion**:\n   - Given the problem's info that all eggs except for 10 were found (meaning the 60 found by the twins + 10 unfound ones = 70), any calculated total eggs \\(E\\) minus 70 corresponds to the number of eggs the friends found.\n   - Thus, the number of eggs the friends found equals \\(E\\) - 70.\n\nHowever, without the explicit total number of eggs \\(E\\), I cannot compute a numeric value for the friends' findings. The problem setup implies we've computed the roles in finding but not solved an explicit equation for \\(E\\). If more concrete total hidden data is provided, we could calculate an explicit value.\n\n**Revised Simplification**:\nUpon reviewing, the eggs found by friends are effectively all found eggs except for those by the twins and the 10 unfound:\n\\[ \n(E - 60) - 10 = \\text{Eggs found by friends} = E - 70 \n\\]\n\nThis implies any given or determined total eggs \\(E\\), subtracted by both the Smith twins and remaining unfound directly gives the friend's findings numerically if stated in the embedding altogether."

      "content": "To confirm the situation:\n\n- The Smith twins found a total of 60 eggs.\n- There are 10 eggs that were not found by anyone.\n\nThe problem asks how many eggs the friends found, which is determined by the eggs not found by the Smith twins and not left unfound. This means all other hidden eggs except:\n\n\\[ \nTotal\\, Eggs - 60\\, (Twins) - 10\\, (Unfound) = Friends' Eggs \n\\]\n\nUltimately needing a direct numeric setup of:\n- If the total hidden eggs \\( Total\\, Eggs \\) were distinctly known or set, say \\( X \\), the outcome would be:\n\n\\[ \nX - 70 = Friends' Eggs \n\\]\n\nGiven no explicit total, if handing further completions, one declares any result pending total values or validations directly manipulated under assumptions here. If providing or specifying the total initially hidden \\( E \\) grants full computation. Since \\( X - 70 \\) arrives from derivations assuming all compositional eggs precise absent explicit numeral acknowledgment over unequivocal seed formulation."

The Smith twins found 60 eggs in total.\n2. There are 10 eggs that were not found by anyone.\n3. The friends would have found \\( E - 70 \\) eggs assuming we knew how many were hidden in total.\n\nHowever, evaluating the problem statement, it doesn't specify the total number of eggs initially hidden, \\( E \\). This makes it impossible to determine exactly how many eggs the friends found.\n\nTherefore, given the data available:\n- We cannot solve for the precise number of eggs found by the friends.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**\n\nThe problem is unsolvable without the explicit number of total eggs that were hid initially."
