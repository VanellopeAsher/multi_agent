      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many dozens of eggs Claire will use in 12 weeks, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day:**  \n   Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she uses 3 eggs per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed per week:**  \n   Since there are 7 days in a week, she will consume:  \n   \\[ 3 \\, \\text{eggs/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days/week} = 21 \\, \\text{eggs/week}.\\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in 12 weeks:**  \n   Over 12 weeks, she will consume:  \n   \\[ 21 \\, \\text{eggs/week} \\times 12 \\, \\text{weeks} = 252 \\, \\text{eggs}.\\]\n\n4. **Convert the total eggs into dozens:**  \n   Since one dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, the number of dozens she uses in 12 weeks is:  \n   \\[ \\frac{252 \\, \\text{eggs}}{12 \\, \\text{eggs/dozen}} = 21 \\, \\text{dozens}.\\]\n\nTherefore, Claire will use 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks. \n\nNow, let's discuss and verify this method with other agents."
