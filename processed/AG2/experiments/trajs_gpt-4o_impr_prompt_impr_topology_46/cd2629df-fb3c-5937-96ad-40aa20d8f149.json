      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Stephen promises to pay his sister after including the 2% interest, and then calculate how much he will owe after making monthly payments of $25 for 11 months.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Debt Including Interest:**\n   - Stephen borrowed $300.\n   - Agreed to pay an additional 2% interest on $300.\n   - Interest = 2% of $300 = \\( \\frac{2}{100} \\times 300 = 6 \\).\n   - Total debt including interest = $300 + $6 = $306.\n\n2. **Determine the Total Amount Paid in the First 11 Months:**\n   - Stephen pays $25 each month for 11 months.\n   - Total paid in the first 11 months = $25 \\times 11 = $275.\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month:**\n   - Total debt = $306.\n   - Total paid in the first 11 months = $275.\n   - Remaining amount = $306 - $275 = $31.\n\nTherefore, Stephen will pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month, excluding any expenses related to his coin purchases."

Calculating a 2% interest on the borrowed amount of $300, which equals $6.\n2. Adding this interest to the principal to get the total debt of $306.\n3. Calculating the total amount Stephen manages to pay over the first 11 months at $25 per month, totaling $275.\n4. Subtracting what Stephen has already paid from the total debt to determine the outstanding amount.\n\nThus, the solution is consistent and verified as correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{31}**"
