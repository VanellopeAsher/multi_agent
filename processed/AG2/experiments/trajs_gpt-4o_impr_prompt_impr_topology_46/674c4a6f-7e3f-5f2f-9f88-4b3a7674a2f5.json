We need to calculate this average and determine if it's 85 or higher.\n\n2. **Calculating the Average**: The current math grade is calculated by summing all the test scores and dividing by the number of scores.\n    - Sum of test scores: \n      \\[\n      70 + 95 + 88 + 90 + 78 = 421\n      \\]\n    - Number of test scores: 5\n    - Average score (math grade): \n      \\[\n      \\frac{421}{5} = 84.2\n      \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Wilson's current math grade is 84.2, which is below the threshold of 85 needed to have the car for the weekend.\n\nLet's discuss this solution and ensure all angles are covered."
