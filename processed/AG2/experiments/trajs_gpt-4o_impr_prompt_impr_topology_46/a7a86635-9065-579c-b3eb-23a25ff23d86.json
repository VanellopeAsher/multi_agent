Let’s break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Number of Kids**: There are 200 kids in total.\n2. **Division into Groups**: They were divided equally into girls and boys, which means there are:\n   - 100 boys\n   - 100 girls\n\n3. **Seashells Collected by Boys**:\n   - Each boy collected 600 seashells.\n   - Therefore, the total number of seashells collected by boys = 100 boys × 600 seashells per boy = 60,000 seashells.\n\n4. **Seashells Collected by Girls**:\n   - The total number of seashells brought by the girls is equal to the number collected by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\n   - Therefore, the total number of shells collected by the girls = 60,000 (collected by boys) + 4 × 60,000 = 300,000 seashells.\n\n5. **Seashells Collected by Each Girl**:\n   - Since 100 girls collected a total of 300,000 seashells, the number of seashells brought by each girl equals:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000\n   \\]\n\nHence, each girl collected 3,000 seashells. \n\nLet's move on to discussion to make sure everything is clear and verify the solution."

There are 100 boys, and each brings back 600 seashells, totaling 60,000 seashells.\n2. The number of seashells collected by the girls is the total shells by the boys (60,000) plus four times that amount, making it 300,000 seashells.\n3.
