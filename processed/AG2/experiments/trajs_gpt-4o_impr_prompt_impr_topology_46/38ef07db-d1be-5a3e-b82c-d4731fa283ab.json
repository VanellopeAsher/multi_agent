      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many feet of crepe-paper streamers James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\]\n\nGiven the dimensions of the backyard fence:\n- The long side (Length) is 20.5 feet.\n- The short side (Width) is 15.5 feet.\n\nLet's perform the calculation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Add the Length and the Width**:\n   - \\( 20.5 + 15.5 = 36.0 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply the Result by 2**:\n   - \\( 2 \\times 36.0 = 72.0 \\)\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the backyard fence is 72.0 feet. Thus, James needs to buy 72.0 feet of crepe-paper streamers.\n\nIn summary, James should purchase 72.0 feet of crepe-paper to cover the entire perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence."
