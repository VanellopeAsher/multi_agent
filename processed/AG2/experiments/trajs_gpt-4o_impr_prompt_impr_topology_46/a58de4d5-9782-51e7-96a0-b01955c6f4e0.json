  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture and then use that information to determine the profit for selling 10 jars.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:**\n   - **Passion fruit**: 2 pounds at $6 per pound.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of passion fruit} = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n   - **Jackfruit**: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of jackfruit} = 1.5 \\times 8 = 12 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n   - **Honey**: 2 pounds at $10 per pound.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of honey} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n   - The water as the secret ingredient doesn't add any cost, so it's not included in the calculation.\n\n2. **Total cost of ingredients for one jar:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the profit from selling 1 jar:**\n   - Selling price per jar is $50.\n   - Profit per jar is the selling price minus the total cost.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit per jar} = 50 - 44 = 6 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total profit for selling 10 jars:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total profit for 10 jars} = 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tim makes a profit of $60 by selling 10 jars of his special mixture. \n\nLet's discuss this solution to ensure everyone agrees with these calculations."
