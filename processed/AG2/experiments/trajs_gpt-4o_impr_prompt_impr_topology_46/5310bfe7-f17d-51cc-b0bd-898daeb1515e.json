According to the problem statement, Richie scored 90 goals:\n   \\[\n   R = 90\n   \\]\n\n2. Let \\( M \\) be the number of goals Mark scored. According to the problem, Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark:\n   \\[\n   R = M + 30\n   \\]\n\n3. Let \\( A \\) be the number of goals Anna scored. According to the problem, Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna:\n   \\[\n   R = A + 55\n   \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( R = 90 \\) into the equations for Mark and Anna:\n- For Mark:\n  \\[\n  90 = M + 30\n  \\]\n  Solving for \\( M \\) gives:\n  \\[\n  M = 90 - 30 = 60\n  \\]\n\n- For Anna:\n  \\[\n  90 = A + 55\n  \\]\n  Solving for \\( A \\) gives:\n  \\[\n  A = 90 - 55 = 35\n  \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:\n\\[\nR + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35 = 185\n\\]\n\nTherefore, all three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."
