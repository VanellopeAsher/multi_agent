Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Days:**\n\n   - There are 31 days in March.\n   - From March 1st to April 19th is 19 days in April.\n\n   Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.\n\n2. **Calculate Days Off:**\n\n   - Billy takes 20% of these days off.\n   - Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.\n\n3. **Calculate Working Days:**\n\n   - Working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of People He Can Help per Day:**\n\n   - He helps 2 people per hour.\n   - He works for 3.5 hours a day.\n\n   People per day = 2 people/hour * 3.5 hours/day = 7 people/day.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Number of People Helped:**\n\n   - Total people helped = Number of people per day * Working days = 7 people/day * 40 days = 280 people.\n\nThus, Billy can help 280 people in total."
