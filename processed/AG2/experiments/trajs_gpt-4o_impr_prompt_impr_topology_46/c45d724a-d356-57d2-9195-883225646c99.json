In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

The cost of one notebook is $15.00.\n2. William bought 50 notebooks.\n3. The total cost for the notebooks is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of notebooks} = 50 \\times 15 = 750 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Calculating the Cost of Ballpens**\n1. The cost of one ballpen is $5.00.\n2. William bought 10 ballpens.\n3. The total cost for the ballpens is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of ballpens} = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Calculating the Total Cost**\n1. Add the total cost of notebooks and the total cost of ballpens:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of notebooks} + \\text{Cost of ballpens} = 750 + 50 = 800 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, William spent a total of $800.00. \n\nI look forward to discussing this approach with Agent Code Executor and Agent Verifier to confirm its completeness and accuracy."
