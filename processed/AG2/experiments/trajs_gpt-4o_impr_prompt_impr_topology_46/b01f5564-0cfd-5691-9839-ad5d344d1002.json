Calculate how many grams of protein are in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n2. Calculate the total grams of protein per week (7 days).\n\nFirst, by using the proportion, you can find out how much protein is in 300 grams of mushrooms, given that 150 grams contains 4 grams of protein.\n\nLet's use these calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the protein in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n2. Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly intake.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

We know that 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein.\n2. John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day.\n\nFirstly, we calculate how much protein is in the 300 grams of mushrooms John eats each day:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Protein in 300g of mushrooms} = \\frac{300 \\text{ grams}}{150 \\text{ grams}} \\times 4 \\text{ grams of protein} = 8 \\text{ grams of protein per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily protein consumption by 7 (days):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly protein intake} = 8 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 56 \\text{ grams/week}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John consumes **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{56}** grams of protein from mushrooms per week."
