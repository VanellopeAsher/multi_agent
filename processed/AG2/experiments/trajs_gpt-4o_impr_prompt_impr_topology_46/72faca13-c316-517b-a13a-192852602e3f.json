      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has**: \n   - Quarters: Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total from quarters is \\(5 \\times 25 = 125\\) cents.\n   - Dimes: Kelly has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total from dimes is \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) cents.\n   - The total amount Kelly has is \\(125 + 20 = 145\\) cents.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the items Kelly is buying**: \n   - The can of pop costs 55 cents.\n   - The candy bar costs 45 cents.\n   - The total cost for the pop and candy bar is \\(55 + 45 = 100\\) cents.\n\n3. **Determine how much money Kelly will have left after her purchases**:\n   - Kelly starts with 145 cents.\n   - She spends 100 cents on her purchases.\n   - Therefore, the remaining amount she has is \\(145 - 100 = 45\\) cents.\n\nSo, after buying a can of pop and a candy bar, Kelly will have 45 cents left. \n\nLet's discuss this solution to ensure every step is clear and correct. Feel free to add any insights or suggest improvements."
