      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine Mark's initial weight before he became unwell.\n\n1. **Weight Loss Calculation**: \n   - Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. \n   - Total weight loss over these 3 months = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.\n\n2. **Weight Gain Calculation**: \n   - During his recovery, Mark gained 5 pounds each month for 2 months. \n   - Total weight gain over these 2 months = 5 pounds/month * 2 months = 10 pounds.\n\n3. **Net Weight Change**: \n   - Net weight change after recovery = Total weight loss - Total weight gain = 30 pounds - 10 pounds = 20 pounds (Net loss).\n\n4. **Final Weight Calculation**:\n   - Mark's final weight after the illness and recovery period is 70 pounds. \n   - Since he had a net loss of 20 pounds, we can set up the equation for his initial weight:\n     Initial weight - 20 pounds (net loss in weight) = 70 pounds (final weight).\n\n5. **Solve for Initial Weight**:\n   - Initial weight = 70 pounds + 20 pounds = 90 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Mark's initial weight before he fell ill was 90 pounds."

The net weight loss was therefore 20 pounds.\n\nGiven that Mark's weight after recovery was 70 pounds, adding back the 20 pounds loss gives us the initial weight:\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial Weight} = 70 + 20 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the conclusion that Mark's initial weight was 90 pounds is corroborated by both approaches.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{90}**"
