  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

      "content": "To determine how much money Elvira will have left to spend on her new outfit, we need to calculate the total cost of her computer setup and accessories, then subtract this total from her budget.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Cost of Items Purchased**:\n   - Computer (includes screen, keyboard, and mouse): €1090\n   - Scanner: €157\n   - CD burner: €74\n   - Printer: €102\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Expenditure**:\n   - Total = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102\n\n3. **Subtract the Total Expenditure from the Budget**:\n   - Budget = €1500\n   - Remaining Money = Budget - Total Expenditure\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\n1. Total cost of items purchased:\n   - Total = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = €1423\n\n2. Subtract this total from Elvira's budget:\n   - Remaining Money = 1500 - 1423 = €77\n\nTherefore, Elvira will have €77 left to spend on her new outfit."
