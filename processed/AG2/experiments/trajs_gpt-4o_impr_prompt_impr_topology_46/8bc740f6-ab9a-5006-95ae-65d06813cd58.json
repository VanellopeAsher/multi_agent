      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites during February. February can have either 28 or 29 days depending upon whether it's a leap year or not. Since the problem states that there are \"2.8 times of ten days\" in the month, we interpret this as 28 days in the month, which aligns with a non-leap year February.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Political and Weather News Articles:**\n   - Average daily articles: 20\n   - Number of days in February: 28\n   - Total articles: \\( 20 \\text{ articles/day} \\times 28 \\text{ days} = 560 \\text{ articles} \\)\n\n2. **Business News Articles:**\n   - Average daily articles: 10\n   - Number of days in February: 28\n   - Total articles: \\( 10 \\text{ articles/day} \\times 28 \\text{ days} = 280 \\text{ articles} \\)\n\n3. **Total Articles Published in February:**\n   - Total articles from both websites: \\( 560 \\text{ articles} + 280 \\text{ articles} = 840 \\text{ articles} \\)\n\nThus, the two websites together published a total of 840 articles in February.\n\nIf any clarifications or discussions are needed, please feel free to reach out!"
