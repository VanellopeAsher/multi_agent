Sum all the individual costs.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure we consider every step:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of each item\nnotebook_price = 1.50\nballpen_price = 0.5\n\n# Calculate the cost for 5 notebooks and 1 ballpen\nnotebooks_cost = 5 * notebook_price\nballpen_cost = ballpen_price\n\n# Calculate the cost of one notebook and two ballpens\none_notebook_two_ballpens_cost = notebook_price + (2 * ballpen_price)\n\n# Since the pencil case costs twice as much, calculate the pencil case cost\npencil_case_cost = 2 * one_notebook_two_ballpens_cost\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = notebooks_cost + ballpen_cost + pencil_case_cost\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

So, the total cost for 5 notebooks is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of 1 Ballpen**:  \n   The ballpen costs $0.50. So, the total cost for 1 ballpen is:\n   \\[\n   0.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Pencil Case**:  \n   A pencil case costs twice as much as the combined cost of 1 notebook and 2 ballpens. First, calculate the cost of 1 notebook and 2 ballpens:\n   \\[\n   1.50 + (2 \\times 0.50) = 2.50\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the pencil case costs:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost**:  \n   Add up all the individual costs:\n   \\[\n   7.50 (notebooks) + 0.50 (ballpen) + 5.00 (pencil case) = 13.00\n   \\]\n\nThus, William spent a total of $13.00. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT STEPS: Discussion and Verification with Agent Verifier."

      "content": "Both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have arrived at the same numerical solution for the total amount William spent. Let us verify this step-by-step:\n\n1. Cost of 5 notebooks:\n   - Each notebook costs $1.50.\n   - Total for 5 notebooks: \\(5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50\\).\n\n2. Cost of 1 ballpen:\n   - Ballpen costs $0.50.\n   - Total for 1 ballpen: \\(0.50\\).\n\n3. Cost of the pencil case:\n   - The pencil case is twice the sum of the cost of 1 notebook and 2 ballpens.\n   - 1 notebook and 2 ballpens cost: \\(1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50 = 2.50\\).\n   - Pencil case costs: \\(2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\\).\n\n4. Total spending:\n   - Summing all costs: \\(7.50 + 0.50 + 5.00 = 13.00\\).\n\nBoth agents' calculations match and evaluating them shows no assumptions were made outside the original context of the given problem statement.\n\nTherefore, I conclude:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{13.0}**"
