      "content": "To determine how much crepe paper James needs to buy for hanging around the fence, we will calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence, since James wants to hang the streamers along the fence. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions of the fence:**\n   - Long side of the rectangle = 20 feet\n   - Short side of the rectangle = 15 feet\n\n2. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:**\n   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n     \\]\n   - Length (long side) = 20 feet\n   - Width (short side) = 15 feet\n\n   Substituting these values into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Consider any obstructions:**\n   - Since the tree is in the middle of the yard and no streamers are being hung from it, it does not affect the calculation of the streamers around the perimeter of the yard.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe-paper streamers to hang them around the perimeter of his backyard fence.\n\nLet's discuss this approach and finalize the solution."
