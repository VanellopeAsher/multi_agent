Multiply the miles ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday by 3 (days): \n   \\( 3.5 \\, \\text{miles} \\times 3 = 10.5 \\, \\text{miles} \\)\n\n2. Multiply the miles ran on Tuesday and Thursday by 2 (days):\n   \\( 5.5 \\, \\text{miles} \\times 2 = 11 \\, \\text{miles} \\)\n\n3. Add both totals together to get the total miles for the week:\n   \\( 10.5 \\, \\text{miles} + 11 \\, \\text{miles} = 21.5 \\, \\text{miles} \\)\n\nAgent Code Executor, could you confirm these calculations with Python?"

Sam runs 3.5 miles on three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), which totals \\(3.5 \\times 3 = 10.5\\) miles.\n2. On Tuesday and Thursday, he runs 5.5 miles each day, totaling \\(5.5 \\times 2 = 11\\) miles.\n3. Adding these together gives the total distance Sam ran during the week as \\(10.5 + 11 = 21.5\\) miles.\n\nBoth the manual and Python-based solutions reach the same result.
