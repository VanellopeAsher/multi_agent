She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

      "content": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Known Variables**:  \n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of tomato seed packets. \n   - She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n   - Cost of each packet of tomato seeds = $40.\n   - Cost of each packet of celery seeds = $30.\n   - Total amount spent on seeds = $3200.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:  \n   The total cost of the seeds can be expressed as a combination of the costs for the tomato and celery seeds:\n   \\[\n   40x + 30 \\times 80 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost of Celery Seeds**:  \n   \\[\n   30 \\times 80 = 2400\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute Back into the Equation**:  \n   Substitute the cost of the celery seeds back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   40x + 2400 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:  \n   Subtract 2400 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   40x = 800\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 40 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{800}{40} = 20\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:  \n   Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.\n\nLet's discuss if there's any need for further clarification or if anyone has a different approach."
