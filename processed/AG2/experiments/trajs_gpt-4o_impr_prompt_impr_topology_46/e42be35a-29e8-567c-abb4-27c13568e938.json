At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?",

      "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of brownies Greta made for herself.**\n   - Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.\n   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 individual brownies, she initially had 12 brownies.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of brownies she received from her office party.**\n   - She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office.\n   - 1/2 dozen equals 6 individual brownies.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of brownies prepared by her friends for the surprise party.**\n   - Her friends prepared 4 dozen brownies.\n   - 4 dozen equals 48 individual brownies.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before any were eaten.**\n   - Add the brownies she made herself, received from her office, and from her friends:\n   - Total = 12 (her own) + 6 (office) + 48 (friends) = 66 brownies.\n\n5. **Subtract the brownies eaten during the party.**\n   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.\n   - 1 1/2 dozen equals 18 individual brownies.\n\n6. **Calculate the remaining brownies.**\n   - Subtract the 18 eaten brownies from the total of 66 brownies before the party:\n   - Remaining = 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.\n\nSo, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over after the entire day."
