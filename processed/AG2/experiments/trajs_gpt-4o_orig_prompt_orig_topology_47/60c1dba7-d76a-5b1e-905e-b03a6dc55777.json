You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

We will translate the relationships into a system of equations and solve for the unknowns.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( B \\) as the number of Magic Cards Becca has.\n- \\( S \\) as the number of Magic Cards Smendrick has.\n- \\( P \\) as the number of Magic Cards PJ has.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following relationships:\n1. The total number of cards is 447: \\( B + S + P = 447 \\).\n2. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick: \\( B = S + 15 \\).\n3. Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards that PJ has: \\( S = 4P \\).\n\nWe'll now solve this system of equations using Python and SymPy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nB, S, P = symbols('B S P')\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\nequation1 = Eq(B + S + P, 447)\nequation2 = Eq(B, S + 15)\nequation3 = Eq(S, 4*P)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2, equation3), (B, S, P))\n\n# Extract the number of cards Becca has\nbecca_cards = solution[B]\nprint(becca_cards)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of Magic Cards that Becca has."
