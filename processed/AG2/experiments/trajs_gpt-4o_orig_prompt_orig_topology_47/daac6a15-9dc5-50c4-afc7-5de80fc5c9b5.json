You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDerrick has a bakery that makes doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut.

      "content": "To find out how much money Derrick makes in June from selling doughnuts, we need to determine the total number of doughnuts sold in the month and then calculate the total revenue based on the selling price per doughnut.\n\nKey Idea:\nSince June typically has 30 days, if Derrick sells a constant number of doughnuts every day and sells all of them, we can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of days, the number of doughnuts sold per day, and the price per doughnut.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the number of doughnuts sold per day, so let's assume Derrick sells \\( x \\) doughnuts every day. In that case, the approach to solve this would be:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts sold in June: \\( \\text{Total Doughnuts} = 30 \\times x \\).\n2. Calculate the total revenue: \\( \\text{Revenue} = 2 \\times \\text{Total Doughnuts} = 2 \\times 30 \\times x \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\) is not specified, we can't calculate the exact revenue Derrick makes. Let's write the formula in Python, which can be used once \\( x \\) is known:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Let x be the number of doughnuts sold per day.\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total revenue calculation\ntotal_revenue = 2 * 30 * x\n\n# Printing the expression for total revenue\nprint(\"Total Revenue in June if Derrick sells all doughnuts is:\", total_revenue)\n```\n\nThis will give you the expression for revenue in terms of \\( x \\). When you know how many doughnuts Derrick sells daily, you can substitute that value in for \\( x \\) to get the total revenue."

Once you have that information, you can substitute it into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Revenue} = 60 \\times x\n\\]\n\nPlease provide the daily sales figure for \\(x\\), and we can calculate the total revenue Derrick makes in June by substituting this value into the formula."
