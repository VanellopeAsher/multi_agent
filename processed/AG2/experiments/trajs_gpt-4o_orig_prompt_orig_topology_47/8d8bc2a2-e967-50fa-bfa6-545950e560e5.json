  "problem": "George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000.5. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGeorge needs to pay for dental work.

We can use Python to perform these calculations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.\n2. Subtract the deposit from the total cost to find the remaining amount George has to pay.\n3. Divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.\n\nLet's write the Python code to do this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, ceiling\n\n# Costs associated with the dental work\nbase_price_per_implant = 2000.5  # Base price per implant\ncrown_extra_cost = 500.5         # Cost of the crown for one implant\ndeposit = 600                    # Already paid deposit\n\n# Hourly wage\nhourly_wage = 15.3\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = 2 * base_price_per_implant + crown_extra_cost\n\n# Calculate remaining amount\nremaining_amount = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Calculate hours needed\n# We use ceiling to ensure we round up to the next whole number of hours\nhours_needed = ceiling(Rational(remaining_amount) / Rational(hourly_wage))\n\nprint(hours_needed)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and print the number of hours George needs to work."
