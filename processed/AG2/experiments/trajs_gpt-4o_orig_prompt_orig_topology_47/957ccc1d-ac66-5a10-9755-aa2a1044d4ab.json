You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow Case 1 since it involves direct calculation using given data.\n\n**Key Idea**: We need to calculate the total calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his weight loss goal and then find the daily deficit required from now until his birthday. This involves determining the number of days between December 31st and July 19th and calculating the daily calorie deficit based on calories needed to lose a pound.\n\nLet's solve the problem using Python:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pounds Andy wants to lose: 30 pounds.\n2. Calculate the total calorie deficit needed: 30 pounds × 3500 calories per pound.\n3. Determine the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.\n4. Calculate the daily calorie deficit by dividing the total calorie deficit by the number of days.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total calorie deficit needed\npounds_to_lose = 30\ncalories_per_pound = 3500\ntotal_calorie_deficit = pounds_to_lose * calories_per_pound\n\n# Calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th\nstart_date = date(2022, 12, 31)\nend_date = date(2023, 7, 19)\nnumber_of_days = (end_date - start_date).days\n\n# Calculate the daily calorie deficit as a fraction\ndaily_calorie_deficit = Rational(total_calorie_deficit, number_of_days)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(daily_calorie_deficit)\n```\n\nThis code will provide the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain to achieve his weight loss goal by his birthday. The output will be in fraction form as requested."
