You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will apply basic algebra to find the length of the shark. Let's follow Case 1, where we use Python code to calculate the solution.\n\n**Key Idea**: We will express the relationship between the lengths of the remoras and the shark using an equation. Since the combined length of the remoras is given as 10% of the shark's body length, we can set up the equation accordingly and solve for the shark's body length.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Let \\( L \\) be the length of the shark.\n2. The combined length of the remoras is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) inches.\n3. According to the problem, this combined length is 10% of the shark's body length, i.e., \\( 0.1 \\times L = 12 \\).\n\nLet's solve this equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(0.1 * L, 12)\n\n# Solve the equation\nshark_length = solve(equation, L)[0]\n\n# Print the shark's length\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the length of the shark's body using sympy's `solve` function and provide the length in exact form."
