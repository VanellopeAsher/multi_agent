You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many action figures Peter can buy with his $70 if he spends an equal amount each day over one week (7 days). \n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the amount Peter can spend per day by dividing his total money by the number of days in the week.\n2. For the first four days (Sunday through Wednesday), determine how many wooden action figures Peter can buy each day at $5 each.\n3. For the remaining three days (Thursday through Saturday), determine how many plastic action figures Peter can buy each day at $2.5 each.\n4. Sum up the total number of action figures purchased throughout the week.\n\nLet's write the corresponding Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Import the sympy library to work with fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total money Peter has\ntotal_money = 70\n# Number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# The amount Peter spends per day\ndaily_spending = Rational(total_money, days_in_week)\n\n# Prices of the action figures\nwooden_price = 5\nplastic_price = 2.5\n\n# Calculate wooden action figures Peter can buy each day from Sunday to Wednesday\nwooden_days = 4\nwooden_figures_per_day = daily_spending // wooden_price\ntotal_wooden_figures = wooden_figures_per_day * wooden_days\n\n# Calculate plastic action figures Peter can buy each day from Thursday to Saturday\nplastic_days = 3\nplastic_figures_per_day = daily_spending // plastic_price\ntotal_plastic_figures = plastic_figures_per_day * plastic_days\n\n# Calculate the total number of action figures\ntotal_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_figures)\n```\n\nRun this code to find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week."

If you received 20 as the answer, it means that we need to make sure those calculations are correct.\n\nHere's the reasoning again, and let's check the math explicitly:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount Peter can spend per day**:\n   - Total money: $70\n   - Number of days: 7\n   - Daily spending = $70 / 7 = $10 per day\n\n2. **Days 1 to 4 (Sunday through Wednesday)**:\n   - Cost of wooden action figures: $5 each\n   - Number of wooden action figures per day = $10 / $5 = 2\n   - Total wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday = 4 days * 2 figures/day = 8 figures\n\n3. **Days 5 to 7 (Thursday through Saturday)**:\n   - Cost of plastic action figures: $2.5 each\n   - Number of plastic action figures per day = $10 / $2.5 = 4\n   - Total plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday = 3 days * 4 figures/day = 12 figures\n\n4. **Total action figures**:\n   - Total wooden figures = 8\n   - Total plastic figures = 12\n   - Total action figures = 8 + 12 = 20\n\nThus, Peter will indeed have \\(\\boxed{20}\\) action figures by the end of the week."
