You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Calculate the depth on Tuesday.\n2. Calculate the depth on Wednesday, which is two-thirds of the Tuesday's depth.\n3. Compute the depth on Thursday by adding half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday to the depth on Wednesday.\n\nLet's use these steps to write a Python program with sympy to perform the exact calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Monday's depth\nmonday_depth = 17\n\n# Tuesday's depth\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + 7\n\n# Wednesday's depth (two thirds of Tuesday's depth)\nwednesday_depth = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_depth\n\n# Difference between Tuesday's and Wednesday's depths\ndifference = tuesday_depth - wednesday_depth\n\n# Thursday's depth\nthursday_depth = wednesday_depth + Rational(1, 2) * difference\n\nprint(thursday_depth)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `Rational` class to ensure that all operations are performed symbolically and results are exact fractions rather than float approximations. The final depth on Thursday will be printed in fraction form."
