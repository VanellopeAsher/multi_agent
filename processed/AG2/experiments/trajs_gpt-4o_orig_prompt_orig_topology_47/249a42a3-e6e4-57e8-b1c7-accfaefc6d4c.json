You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.\n2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.\n3. Calculate the number of people Billy can help on the days he works.\n\nSince we have calculations that can be fulfilled by Python, we'll use approach Case 1, to write a program for this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total number of days\nmarch_days = 31\napril_days = 19\ntotal_days = march_days + april_days\n\n# Calculate the number of days off\ndays_off = total_days * Rational(20, 100)\n\n# Calculate the number of working days\nworking_days = total_days - days_off\n\n# Calculate the number of people Billy can help per day\npeople_per_hour = 2\nhours_per_day = Rational(7, 2)  # 3.5 hours is represented as a fraction\npeople_per_day = people_per_hour * hours_per_day\n\n# Calculate the total number of people helped\ntotal_people_helped = working_days * people_per_day\n\n# Print the total number of people helped in fraction form\nprint(total_people_helped)\n```\n\nLet's see the calculation step-by-step:\n- Calculate the total days: \\(31 + 19 = 50\\).\n- Calculate the days off: \\(50 \\times 0.2 = 10\\).\n- Calculate the days Billy works: \\(50 - 10 = 40\\).\n- Calculate people helped per day: \\(2 \\times 3.5 = 7\\).\n- Total people helped: \\(40 \\times 7 = 280\\).\n\nThus, the total number of people Billy helps is \\(\\boxed{280}\\)."
