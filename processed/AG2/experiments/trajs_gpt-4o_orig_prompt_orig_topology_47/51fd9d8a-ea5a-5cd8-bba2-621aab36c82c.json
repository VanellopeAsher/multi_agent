You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

This means that without a specific age for Jean, we express Peter's age as a function of Jean's age. Let's break the expression down:\n\n\\[ P_t = 83.3333333333333 - 0.916666666666667 \\times J_e \\]\n\nThis implies that Peter's age is \\( \\frac{250}{3} - \\frac{11}{12} \\times J_e \\).\n\nSince we don't have specific information about Jean's age, we'd typically need it to find a numerical value for Peter's age. However, if we assume Jean's age is such that Peter's age is a whole number or we need to express it based on the integer values, we can leave it as is or make an assumption about Jean.\n\nFor completeness, let's express Peter's age in fractional form:\n\nPeter's age = \\(\\frac{250}{3} - \\frac{11}{12} J_e\\)\n\nGiven no additional information on Jean's age, the solution is expressed as above, with Jean's age required for a specific numerical answer."
