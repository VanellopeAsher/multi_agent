  "problem": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has, subtract the number of cards she keeps, and then divide what remains by the number of cards each student receives.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks with 25 cards each.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards each.\n3. Find the total number of all cards by adding the basketball and baseball cards.\n4. Subtract the 50 cards Miss Maria keeps.\n5. Divide the remaining number of cards by 10 to find the number of students.\n\nThis problem can be solved directly using Python. Let's write the code to solve it:\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy for fraction representation if needed\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n\n# Total number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n\n# Total number of cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\n\n# Cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_miss_maria_keeps = 50\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_miss_maria_keeps\n\n# Each student receives 10 cards\nstudents = cards_given_to_students / 10\n\n# Print the number of students\nprint(Rational(students))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can find the number of students."
