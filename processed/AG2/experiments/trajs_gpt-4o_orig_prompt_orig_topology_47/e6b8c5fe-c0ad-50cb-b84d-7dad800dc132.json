You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nColby wants to buy some gumballs.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has in total and then determine how many gumballs he can buy with that amount. Let's assume that each gumball costs 5 cents.\n\nHere's how we can break down the solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total value of each type of coin:\n   - Quarters are worth 25 cents each.\n   - Dimes are worth 10 cents each.\n   - Nickels are worth 5 cents each.\n   - Pennies are worth 1 cent each.\n\n2. Sum up all the values to get the total amount of money Colby has.\n\n3. Divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball (5 cents) to find out how many gumballs Colby can purchase.\n\nSince this problem can be solved directly using a calculation, we'll use Python to do the math:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Values of the coins in cents\nquarter_value = 25\ndime_value = 10\nnickel_value = 5\npenny_value = 1\n\n# Number of each type of coin\nnum_quarters = 8\nnum_dimes = 6\nnum_nickels = 14\nnum_pennies = 15\n\n# Total amount of money in cents\ntotal_cents = (num_quarters * quarter_value +\n               num_dimes * dime_value +\n               num_nickels * nickel_value +\n               num_pennies * penny_value)\n\n# Cost of one gumball in cents\ngumball_cost = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of gumballs he can buy\nnum_gumballs = Rational(total_cents, gumball_cost)\n\nprint(num_gumballs)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we will get the number of gumballs Colby can purchase. The answer will be a whole number since the Rational function will simplify the division. The result should be enclosed in a box: \\(\\boxed{ \\text{result} }\\). Let's proceed to find the answer."
