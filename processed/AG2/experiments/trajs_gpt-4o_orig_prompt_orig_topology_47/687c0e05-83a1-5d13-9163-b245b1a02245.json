You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

Let \\( x \\) be the total number of unicorns in the world.\n2. A third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Thus, the number of unicorns in Scotland is \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\).\n3. Two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{x}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq((2/3) * (x/3), 6)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# The solution gives the total number of unicorns in the world\ntotal_unicorns = solution[0]\n\n# Calculate how many are left in the world\n# Deduct those in Scotland from the total\nleft_unicorns = total_unicorns - (total_unicorns / 3)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The number of unicorns left in the world is:\", left_unicorns)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of unicorns that are left in the world after accounting for those in the Scottish Highlands."
