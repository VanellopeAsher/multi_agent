      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow these steps systematically to determine how many articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday compared to Tuesday. This problem can be approached using algebraic reasoning and Python code for calculations.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe can use algebraic expressions to model the number of articles written over the three days and then solve for the unknowns.\n\n1. **Identify Variables and Equations**:\n    - Let \\( A_m \\) be the number of articles written on Monday.\n    - Let \\( A_t \\) be the number of articles written on Tuesday.\n    - Let \\( A_w \\) be the number of articles written on Wednesday.\n\n2. **Model the Problem**:\n    - From the problem statement, \\( A_m = 5 \\).\n    - On Tuesday, Meredith wrote \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) more articles than on Monday, so \\( A_t = A_m + \\frac{2}{5}A_m = 5 + 2 = 7 \\).\n    - Let \\( x \\) be the factor by which Wednesday's articles differ from Tuesday's. Thus, \\( A_w = x \\times A_t = 7x \\).\n\n3. **Use the Time Information**:\n    - Each article takes 4 hours, and the total time spent is 104 hours:\n    \\[\n    4A_m + 4A_t + 4A_w = 104\n    \\]\n    Substitute known values:\n    \\[\n    4 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 7 + 4 \\times 7x = 104\n    \\]\n\n4. **Simplify and Solve the Equation**:\n    \\[\n    20 + 28 + 28x = 104\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    48 + 28x = 104\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    28x = 56\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = 2\n    \\]\n\nHence, Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMeredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\nUsing the format, here is the Python code to solve it: \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Known articles on Monday and Tuesday\nA_m = 5\nA_t = 7\n\n# Equation for total hours spent\nequation = Eq(4*A_m + 4*A_t + 4 * (x * A_t), 104)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Meredith wrote\", solution[0], \"times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\")\n```\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."

We determined through calculations that Meredith wrote \\(2\\) times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\nLet me summarize the solution process without queries:\n\n1. We identified the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday (\\(A_m = 5\\)) and Tuesday (\\(A_t = 7\\)).\n2. Each article takes 4 hours to write, and the total hours spent over the three days are 104.\n3. Set up the equation based on the total time:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times A_m + 4 \\times A_t + 4 \\times (x \\times A_t) = 104\n\\]\n\n4. Substituted known values and solved for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n28 + 28x = 104 \\implies 28x = 76 \\implies x = 2\n\\]\n\nThe solution shows that Meredith wrote \\(\\boxed{2}\\) times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\nIf there's anything else you'd like help with, feel free to ask!"
