You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down systematically using a mix of mathematical reasoning and Python computation where applicable.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nWe need to determine the cost of cognac bottles and then calculate the total expenditure. Here's a structured way to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Find the price per bottle of scotch.**\n\n   Since John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, the price per bottle of scotch is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price per scotch bottle} = \\frac{600}{10} = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the price per bottle of cognac.**\n\n   The price per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the price per bottle of scotch. So:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price per cognac bottle} = 60 + 0.5 \\times 60 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of cognac bottles.**\n\n   John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch. Hence, he buys:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cognac bottles} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of cognac.**\n\n   The total cost for cognac would be:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \\times 90\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the overall expenditure.**\n\n   The total expenditure includes both scotch and cognac:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expenditure} = 600 + \\text{Total cost for cognac}\n   \\]\n\nNow, I will compute the total cost using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total cost of cognac\nnum_cognac_bottles = 20\nprice_per_cognac_bottle = 90\ntotal_cost_cognac = num_cognac_bottles * price_per_cognac_bottle\n\n# Calculate the total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = 600 + total_cost_cognac\n\n# Print the result using the `print` function\nprint(f\"\\\\boxed{{{total_expenditure}}}\")\n```\n\nLet's calculate this."
