You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $300 every day.

Calculate the total earnings for the week.\n2. Subtract the total amount spent from the total earnings to find out how much Gerald has left.\n\nWe can easily write a Python program to do this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of days Gerald worked in a week\ndays_worked = 7\n# Daily earning\ndaily_earning = 300\n# Total amount spent\namount_spent = 1000\n\n# Calculate total earnings for the week\ntotal_earnings = days_worked * daily_earning\n\n# Calculate amount left\namount_left = total_earnings - amount_spent\n\n# Print the result\nprint(amount_left)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the amount of money Gerald has left after his expenses. \nAfter running this, the answer should be printed. Let's evaluate the code."

Number of days worked in a week = 7\n3. Total earnings for the week = \\( 300 \\times 7 = 2100 \\)\n4. Amount spent = $1000\n5. Amount left = Total earnings - Amount spent = \\( 2100 - 1000 = 1100 \\)\n\nSo, Gerald has \\(\\boxed{1100}\\) dollars left."
