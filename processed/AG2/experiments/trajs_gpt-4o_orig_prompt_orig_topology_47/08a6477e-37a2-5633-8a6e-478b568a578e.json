You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Let's break the problem down step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: Let \\( x \\) be the number of bandages used on the first day.\n\n2. **First Day**: \n   - Start with 19 bandages.\n   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.\n   - Total bandages available at the end of the day: \\( 19 + 50 - x \\).\n\n3. **Second Day**: \n   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is \\( x - 10 \\).\n   - Total bandages available at the end of the second day: \\( 19 + 50 - x - (x - 10) = 69 - 2x \\).\n\n4. **Third Day**:\n   - They ordered two bulk packs of bandages, so they received \\( 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\) bandages.\n   - They used half a pack, which is \\( 50 \\div 2 = 25 \\) bandages.\n   - Total bandages available at the end of the third day: \\( 69 - 2x + 100 - 25 = 144 - 2x \\).\n\n5. **Final Condition**:\n   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n   - Therefore, \\( 144 - 2x = 78 \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - We will solve the equation \\( 144 - 2x = 78 \\) to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\nLet's proceed with solving the equation using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(144 - 2*x, 78)\n\n# Solve the equation\nbandages_used_on_first_day = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(bandages_used_on_first_day)\n```\n\nThis code will provide the number of bandages used on the first day."
