You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRaymond initially had $2100.

This is a straightforward arithmetic problem that can be solved using a simple calculation.\n\n**Key Idea**: Case 1 - We can write a Python program to carry out the arithmetic operations directly.\n\nHereâ€™s the plan:\n- Start with the initial amount of money Raymond has.\n- Add the amount he saved from his allowance.\n- Subtract the amounts he spent on the comic book and the puzzle.\n- Print the final amount of money he has left.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Initial amount of money\ninitial_money = 2100\n\n# Amount saved from allowance\nsaved_money = 1100\n\n# Amount spent on comic book and puzzle\nspent_on_comic = 500\nspent_on_puzzle = 1900\n\n# Calculating the remaining money\nremaining_money = initial_money + saved_money - spent_on_comic - spent_on_puzzle\n\n# Output the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\nExecuting this Python code will give us the amount of money Raymond has left.
