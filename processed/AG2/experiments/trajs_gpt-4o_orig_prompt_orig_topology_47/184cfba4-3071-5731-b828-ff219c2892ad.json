You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

We will approach this with Case 1, as the problem can be solved directly using Python to compute the solution.\n\n### Key Ideas:\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n2. Let \\( y \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n3. We know from the problem:\n   - Each small stuffed animal costs $40.\n   - Each large stuffed animal costs 3 times more than a small one, i.e., $120.\n   - Teresa earned $1200 in total.\n   - She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\( x = 2y \\).\n\n### Equation Setup:\n- The total revenue from small stuffed animals is \\( 40x \\).\n- The total revenue from large stuffed animals is \\( 120y \\).\n- Total revenue is \\( 40x + 120y = 1200 \\).\n- And \\( x = 2y \\).\n\nBy substituting \\( x = 2y \\) into the revenue equation, we can solve for \\( y \\), and subsequently find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation for the number of small and large animals\nequation1 = Eq(x, 2*y)\n# Equation for the total earnings\nequation2 = Eq(40*x + 120*y, 1200)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (x, y))\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(f\"Number of small stuffed animals sold: {solution[x]}\")\n```\n\nLet's run this Python code to find the solution."

      "content": "Apologies for the confusion earlierâ€”the approach and result I provided are indeed correct. Let's re-evaluate the problem by verifying manually without code to further clarify:\n\n### Key Information and Setup:\n1.
