      "content": "To solve this math problem, we need to determine Mark's initial weight before he started losing weight. The problem states that he lost weight at a rate of 10 pounds per month and that his final weight was 70 pounds.\n\nKey Idea:\nSince the problem involves a straightforward calculation based on his final weight and the rate at which weight was lost, it can be directly solved using basic arithmetic in Python. We assume that we know over how many months the weight loss occurred, or we could simply express the formula based on an unknown number of months if that information is not supplied. For this example, let's assume he lost weight for \\( n \\) months.\n\nLet's solve the problem using Python:\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of months.\n- Initial weight = Final weight + (Rate of weight loss \\(\\times\\) Number of months).\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the initial weight if we assume a certain number of months of weight loss:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Let 'n' be the number of months Mark was unwell.\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Mark's rate of weight loss per month\nrate_of_weight_loss = 10\n\n# Mark's final weight\nfinal_weight = 70\n\n# Calculate the initial weight\ninitial_weight = final_weight + rate_of_weight_loss * n\n\n# Solve for initial weight when n is known\n# For example, let's assume he lost weight for 3 months\nmonths_of_loss = 3\ncalculated_initial_weight = initial_weight.subs(n, months_of_loss)\nprint(calculated_initial_weight)\n```\n\nIf the number of months \\( n \\) is not given, the expression will be left in terms of \\( n \\). Here we assume 3 months for illustration. Adjust the `months_of_loss` variable to reflect the actual duration if necessary."

      "content": "Thank you for providing the number of months. Mark lost weight over a period of 3 months. Let's use this information to find out his initial weight before the weight loss.\n\nSince we know he lost weight for 3 months at a rate of 10 pounds per month, we can calculate his initial weight using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Initial Weight} = \\text{Final Weight} + (\\text{Rate of Weight Loss} \\times \\text{Number of Months}) \\]\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Initial Weight} = 70 + (10 \\times 3) = 100 \\]\n\nHence, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds. To confirm this programmatically, see below:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the variables\nn = symbols('n')\nrate_of_weight_loss = 10\nfinal_weight = 70\n\n# Substitute n = 3\nmonths_of_loss = 3\ninitial_weight = final_weight + rate_of_weight_loss * months_of_loss\n\nprint(initial_weight)  # This should output 100\n```\n\nTherefore, the initial weight of Mark was \\(\\boxed{100}\\) pounds."
