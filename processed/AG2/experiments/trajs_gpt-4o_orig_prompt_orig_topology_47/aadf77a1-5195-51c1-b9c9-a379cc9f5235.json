You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

Calculate the area covered by the medium and large shirts separately.\n2. Subtract this combined area from the total area of the quilt.\n3. Divide the remaining area by the area of one small shirt to find out how many small shirts were used.\n\nGiven:\n- Total area of the quilt = 101 square feet\n- Medium shirt covers 4 square feet\n- Large shirt covers 6 square feet\n- Number of medium shirts used = 8\n- Number of large shirts used = 6\n- Small shirt covers 3 square feet\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n1. **Calculate the area covered by 8 medium shirts:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of medium shirts} = 8 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area covered by 6 large shirts:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of large shirts} = 6 \\times 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total area covered by medium and large shirts:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total covered area} = (\\text{Area of medium shirts}) + (\\text{Area of large shirts})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the remaining area to be covered by small shirts:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining area} = 101 - \\text{Total covered area}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of small shirts used:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of small shirts} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining area}}{3}\n   \\]\n\nLet's implement these calculations in Python:\n\n```python\n# Using sympy for exact calculations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Known values\ntotal_area = 101\nmedium_shirt_area = 4\nlarge_shirt_area = 6\nnumber_of_medium_shirts = 8\nnumber_of_large_shirts = 6\nsmall_shirt_area = 3\n\n# Calculate areas\nmedium_area_total = number_of_medium_shirts * medium_shirt_area\nlarge_area_total = number_of_large_shirts * large_shirt_area\ntotal_covered_area = medium_area_total + large_area_total\n\n# Calculate remaining area for small shirts\nremaining_area = total_area - total_covered_area\n\n# Solve for the number of small shirts\nsmall_shirts = remaining_area / small_shirt_area\n\n# Print the result\nprint(small_shirts)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find the number of small shirts Octavia used."
