You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

Let's proceed using Case 1, as we can solve this using straightforward calculations.\n\nKey idea: \n1. Use the relationships between the number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna to determine the goals scored by each.\n2. Sum their goals to find the total goals scored by all three teenagers.\n\nRichie's goal count, \\( R \\), is given as 90.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n- Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( M \\) as the number of goals scored by Mark.\n- \\( A \\) as the number of goals scored by Anna.\n\nThus, we have the equations:\n\\[ R = M + 30 \\]\n\\[ R = A + 55 \\]\n\nGiven \\( R = 90 \\):\n\n\\[ 90 = M + 30 \\]\n\\[ 90 = A + 55 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( M \\) and \\( A \\):\n\n1. Calculate the number of goals scored by Mark (\\( M \\)).\n2. Calculate the number of goals scored by Anna (\\( A \\)).\n3. Sum the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Given\nR = 90\n\n# Solving for Mark\nM = R - 30\n\n# Solving for Anna\nA = R - 55\n\n# Calculating total goals\ntotal_goals = R + M + A\n\n# Print the results in fraction form\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(\"Richie scored:\", R)\nprint(\"Mark scored:\", M)\nprint(\"Anna scored:\", A)\nprint(\"Total goals scored by all three:\", Rational(total_goals))\n```\n\nThe code should provide us the total goals scored by all three teenagers \\(\\boxed{}\\) in a fraction form."
