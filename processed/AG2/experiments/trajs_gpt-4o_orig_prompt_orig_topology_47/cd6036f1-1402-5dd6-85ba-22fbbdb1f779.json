You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the process described to find Mark's initial weight before he fell ill.\n\nKey Idea:\nSince the problem involves a sequence of weight loss and gain over several months, we can calculate the changes in reverse to determine Mark's starting weight.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Mark's final weight is 70 pounds after his recovery.\n2. During his recovery, he gained 5 pounds per month for 2 months, so the total weight gain during recovery is \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) pounds.\n3. Before his recovery, he lost weight for 3 months, losing 10 pounds per month. The total weight loss during illness is \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\) pounds.\n\nCalculating Mark's initial weight:\n- Start with his final weight (70 pounds), subtract the weight gained during recovery, and then add back the weight lost during illness.\n\nLet's perform this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initialization of variables\nfinal_weight = 70  # Mark's weight after recovery\nweight_gain_recovery = 5  # Pounds gained per month during recovery\nmonths_recovery = 2  # Number of months of weight gain\n\nweight_loss_illness = 10  # Pounds lost per month during illness\nmonths_illness = 3  # Number of months of weight loss\n\n# Calculate total weight change\ntotal_gain = weight_gain_recovery * months_recovery\ntotal_loss = weight_loss_illness * months_illness\n\n# Calculate initial weight before illness\ninitial_weight = final_weight - total_gain + total_loss\n\n# Output the result\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nRunning this program will give us Mark's initial weight before he fell ill."

Final weight after recovery: 70 pounds\n2. Total weight gained during recovery (5 pounds/month for 2 months): \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) pounds\n3. Total weight lost during illness (10 pounds/month for 3 months): \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\) pounds\n\nInitial weight calculation:\n- Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost - Total weight gained\n- Initial weight = \\(70 + 30 - 10 = 90\\) pounds\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."
