      "content": "For exact arithmetic handling and using fractional values rather than floating point, we can leverage the `sympy` library, which allows us to represent the numbers as fractions to avoid any floating-point precision issues. This ensures that calculations are done symbolically with exact values.\n\nLet's modify the previous Python code to use `sympy` to ensure we get an exact fraction (even though the result will ultimately be an integer). \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define prices using Rational to ensure exact values\nnotebook_price = Rational(3, 2)  # Represents $1.50\nballpen_price = Rational(1, 2)   # Represents $0.50\n\n# Calculate cost of 5 notebooks\ncost_notebooks = 5 * notebook_price\n\n# Calculate cost of 1 ballpen\ncost_one_ballpen = ballpen_price\n\n# Calculate cost of pencil case\ncost_pencil_case = 2 * (notebook_price + 2 * ballpen_price)\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_notebooks + cost_one_ballpen + cost_pencil_case\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nWhen this code runs, it will provide the exact total cost, which is \\(\\boxed{13}\\). This is consistent with the arithmetic steps we outlined, but using the `sympy` library reassures us of obtaining the exact result in the fractional or whole number form without any floating-point arithmetic issues."
