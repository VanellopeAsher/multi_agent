You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow the steps outlined in Case 3, since it's a word problem that requires some reasoning and simple algebraic calculations.\n\n1. Define the variables:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the amount in mL of the first medicine per dose.\n   - The second medicine per dose is \\( 3x \\) (as stated in the problem).\n\n2. According to the problem, the total combined dosage of both medicines per dose is \\( x + 3x = 4x \\).\n\n3. There are 8 doses in total, and they collectively add up to 448 mL. So we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 4x = 448\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve this equation to find \\( x \\), which represents the amount of the first medicine per dose.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(8 * 4 * x, 448)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount of the first medicine combined by Saanvi each time."
