You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

To find the total:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total money} = 4 \\times 10 + 6 \\times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the money Ali gives to his sister.**\n   - Ali gives half of the total money to his sister:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Money to sister} = \\frac{160}{2} = 80\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining amount of money after giving money to his sister.**\n   - After giving money to his sister, Ali has:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining money} = 160 - 80 = 80\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate how much money Ali uses for dinner.**\n   - Ali uses \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the remaining money to buy dinner:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Money for dinner} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = 48\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of money he has after buying dinner.**\n   - After buying dinner, the money he has left:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Money left} = 80 - 48 = 32\n     \\]\n\nWe will now write a Python code to compute these values and print the final amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner.\n\n```python\n# Python code to solve the problem\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial money calculation\ntotal_money = 4 * 10 + 6 * 20  # Four $10 bills and six $20 bills\n\n# Money given to sister\nmoney_to_sister = total_money / 2\n\n# Money remaining with Ali\nremaining_money = total_money - money_to_sister\n\n# Money used for dinner (3/5 of the remaining)\nmoney_for_dinner = Rational(3, 5) * remaining_money\n\n# Money left after dinner\nmoney_left = remaining_money - money_for_dinner\n\n# Output the result\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the amount of money Ali has left in fractional form. According to the calculations we have done, the amount should be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]"
