You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJenna shares her living space with four other people.

We'll calculate how much each person would contribute monthly and then multiply by 12 to find their annual contribution.\n\nKey idea: \n1. Calculate the monthly contribution per person by dividing the total monthly electricity cost by the number of people.\n2. Multiply the monthly contribution by 12 to find the annual contribution for each person.\n\nLet's write the code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Monthly cost of electricity\nmonthly_cost = 100\n\n# Number of people sharing the cost\npeople_count = 5\n\n# Calculate monthly contribution per person\nmonthly_contribution_per_person = monthly_cost / people_count\n\n# Calculate annual contribution per person\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_contribution_per_person * 12\n\n# Output the result as a fraction\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(annual_contribution_per_person))\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill in fractional form."

Let's verify and explain the solution given:\n\n1. **Monthly cost**: The total electricity cost is $100.\n2. **People sharing cost**: There are 5 people sharing this cost.\n3. **Monthly contribution per person**: \\( \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\text{ dollars per person per month} \\).\n4. **Annual contribution per person**: \\( 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\text{ dollars per year} \\).\n\nThus, the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill is \\(\\boxed{240}\\) dollars."
