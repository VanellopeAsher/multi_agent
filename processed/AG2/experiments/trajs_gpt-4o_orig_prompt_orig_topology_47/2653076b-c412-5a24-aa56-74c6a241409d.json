You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We will use Python to make this calculation straightforward.\n\nHere is the key idea for solving the problem:\n\nCase 1: This problem can be solved directly with Python code by calculating the total amount before discount and then applying the discount.\n\nWe'll calculate the total price for each type of item, sum them up, and then apply a 10% discount to find the total bill.
