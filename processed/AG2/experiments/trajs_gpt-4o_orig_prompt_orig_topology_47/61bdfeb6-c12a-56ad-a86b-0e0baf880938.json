You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSamwell owns an appliance store.

Calculate the number of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs sold using their respective fractions of the total sales.\n\n2. Subtract the calculated number of TVs from the total to find the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nNow, let's convert these steps into Python code.\n\nWe'll use the `sympy` library to handle any required fraction operations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, nsimplify\n\n# Total number of TVs sold\ntotal_tvs = 40\n\n# Fractions for each type of TV sold\nsmart_tv_fraction = Rational(1, 4)\nanalog_tv_fraction = Rational(1, 8)\nprojection_tv_fraction = Rational(1, 5)\n\n# Calculate number of smart TVs sold\nsmart_tv_sold = total_tvs * smart_tv_fraction\n\n# Calculate number of analog TVs sold\nanalog_tv_sold = total_tvs * analog_tv_fraction\n\n# Calculate number of projection TVs sold\nprojection_tv_sold = total_tvs * projection_tv_fraction\n\n# Calculate number of OLED TVs sold\noled_tv_sold = total_tvs - (smart_tv_sold + analog_tv_sold + projection_tv_sold)\n\n# Print the number of OLED TVs sold in fraction form\nprint(\"Number of OLED TVs sold:\", oled_tv_sold)\n```\n\nRun the above code to find out how many OLED TVs were sold. The answer will be displayed in fractional form."
