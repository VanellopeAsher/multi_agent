  "problem": "There are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can proceed with Case 1: Use Python to calculate the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France.\n\n### Key Idea:\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of flights made by the first aircraft.\n2. According to the problem, three-fourths of its flights go to Greece, and the rest are evenly divided between France and Germany.\n3. The second aircraft flies 44 flights to Poland, which is half of the total flights of the first aircraft.\n4. Therefore, the equation for the total flights of the first aircraft will be \\( x = 2 \\times 44 = 88 \\).\n5. With \\( x = 88 \\), calculate the number of flights to France.\n\n### Calculation:\n- Total flights, \\( x = 88 \\).\n- Flights to Greece = \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 88\\).\n- Remaining flights = \\( 88 - \\text{flights to Greece} \\).\n- Flights to France = \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{remaining flights}\\).\n\nNow, we can write a Python program to do the calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of flights by the first aircraft\nx = 2 * 44\n\n# Flights to Greece\nflights_to_greece = Rational(3, 4) * x\n\n# Remaining flights are divided between France and Germany\nremaining_flights = x - flights_to_greece\nflights_to_france = Rational(1, 2) * remaining_flights\n\nprint(flights_to_france)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will give you the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France. Let's compute that:\n\n```python\nprint(flights_to_france) # Running this line in the code\n```\n\nThis will result in:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
