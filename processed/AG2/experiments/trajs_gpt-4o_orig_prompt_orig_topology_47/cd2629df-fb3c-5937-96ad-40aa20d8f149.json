  "problem": "Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To make things more interesting, he decided to pay her back in a unique way. For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month. On the twelfth month, he will pay the remaining amount, including the interest, and also plans to buy a coin worth $100.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Stephen owes after adding the interest and then determine how much he pays in the twelfth month after making regular payments for 11 months. Hereâ€™s how we can calculate it:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount owed including interest.\n2. Determine how much Stephen has paid after 11 months.\n3. Subtract the amount paid from the total owed to find out how much he needs to pay in the twelfth month.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial amount borrowed\nborrowed = 300\n\n# Interest rate\ninterest_rate = Rational(2, 100)  # 2%\n\n# Total amount to be repaid including interest\ntotal_amount_owed = borrowed + borrowed * interest_rate\n\n# Amount paid per month for 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\ntotal_paid_in_11_months = 11 * monthly_payment\n\n# Amount remaining to be paid\nremaining_amount = total_amount_owed - total_paid_in_11_months\n\n# Print the remaining amount in exact form\nprint(f\"Remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month: {remaining_amount}\")\n```\n\nRun the above code to find out how much Stephen needs to pay his sister in the twelfth month. This will give us the final amount using exact fractions as required."
