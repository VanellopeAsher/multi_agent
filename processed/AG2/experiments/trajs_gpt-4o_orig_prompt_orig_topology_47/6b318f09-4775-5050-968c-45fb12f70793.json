You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow Case 1, as the problem involves direct calculation using arithmetic operations. We can use Python to perform these calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of people invited. Then, subtract those who couldn't come due to illness and those who had previous commitments. Let's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of people invited\nfamilies_with_6_people = 12\npeople_per_family_6 = 6\nfamilies_with_4_people = 15\npeople_per_family_4 = 4\n\ntotal_people = (families_with_6_people * people_per_family_6) + (families_with_4_people * people_per_family_4)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of people who couldn't make it\npeople_ill = 16\nprevious_commitment = Rational(1, 4) * people_ill\n\n# Total people not attending\npeople_not_attending = people_ill + previous_commitment\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of people who show up\npeople_show_up = total_people - people_not_attending\n\n# Print the result\nprint(people_show_up)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We compute the total number of people invited by multiplying the number of families by the number of people in each family and adding those together.\n- We calculate the number of people with previous commitments as a fraction of those who are ill.\n- We then subtract those who couldn't attend due to illness and previous commitments from the total number to find out how many people actually show up.\n- Finally, we print the number of people who show up, keeping fractions in their exact form."
