You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun above the ground from the perspective of Sahir's house after a series of movements. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, making an initial angle of 32 degrees above the ground.\n\n2. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours. So, the total additional angle after these 10 hours is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 50 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n3. After moving for 10 hours, the sun is at an angle of:\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ degrees} + 50 \\text{ degrees} = 82 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n4. The sun then moves at 3 degrees per hour for 2 more hours. The additional angle is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n5. Therefore, the total angle from the ground to the sun after all its movement is:\n   \\[\n   82 \\text{ degrees} + 6 \\text{ degrees} = 88 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\nThus, after all this movement, the sun will be at an angle of 88 degrees from the ground.\n\nUsing this analysis, I will compute this in Python using the constraints described:\n```python\n# Initial angle from the pyramid ground\ninitial_angle = 32\n\n# Sun movement for the first 10 hours at 5 degrees per hour\nfirst_movement = 5 * 10\n\n# Sun movement for the next 2 hours at 3 degrees per hour\nsecond_movement = 3 * 2\n\n# Total angle calculation\nfinal_angle = initial_angle + first_movement + second_movement\n\nprint(final_angle)\n```\n\nRunning this code will yield the result of \\(\\boxed{88}\\) degrees."
