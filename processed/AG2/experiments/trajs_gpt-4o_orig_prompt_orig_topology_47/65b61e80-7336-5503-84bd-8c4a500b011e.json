You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by the friends based on the information given.\n\nKey Idea: This problem can be solved using a simple calculation without needing a program. We'll solve it using Case 2: Reasoning.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. The Smith twins found a total of \\( 30 + 30 = 60 \\) eggs.\n2. We know that all other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that, out of the total number of eggs, 10 eggs were not found, and the rest were discovered by either the twins or their friends.\n3. By this information, the total number of eggs found is the sum of eggs found by the Smith twins and their friends. If we let the variable \\( x \\) represent the total number of eggs, then the number of eggs the friends found is \\( x - 60 - 10 \\).\n\nSince we are not given the total number of eggs, we infer it as:\n\\[ x = 60 + \\text{eggs found by friends} + 10 \\]\n\\[ 70 = 60 + \\text{eggs found by friends} + 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs the friends found is:\n\\[\n\\text{eggs found by friends} = 70 - 60 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's write the calculation explicitly:\n\nThe total eggs found by people = Total eggs - Eggs not found.\n\nSo, friends find the rest:\n\\[\n\\text{Total eggs} = \\text{eggs found by twins} + \\text{eggs found by friends} + 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\n70 = 60 + \\text{eggs found by friends}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{eggs found by friends} = 0\n\\]\n\nSince what was asked is:\nHow many eggs did the friends find?\nWe conclude the number of eggs the friends found is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"
