On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "Key Idea: We can solve this problem by directly calculating the hourly wages of both Billy and Sally at various points in time and then computing how much they earn for working 20 hours.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate their hourly wages over time:\n\n1. Billy's initial rate: $10 per hour.\n2. After 2 months, Billy's rate: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n3. On his first anniversary (12 months), Billy's rate: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.\n\nSally's wage progression:\n1. Sally's starting rate is $0.50 more than Billy’s starting rate. Therefore, Sally’s starting rate: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n2. After 2 months, Sally's rate: $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.\n\nSince we're asked to find how much more Billy will earn than Sally if both work 20 hours, we will use their latest rates:\n\n- Billy’s latest rate (after his first anniversary) is $11.50 per hour.\n- Sally’s latest rate (after 2 months) is $11.00 per hour.\n\nKnowing these rates, we can now calculate their total earnings for working 20 hours each.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the earnings\nbilly_hourly_rate = 11.50  # Billy's rate after one year\nsally_hourly_rate = 11.00  # Sally's rate after two months\n\n# Both work 20 hours\nbilly_earnings = billy_hourly_rate * 20\nsally_earnings = sally_hourly_rate * 20\n\n# Find the difference\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Output the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nRun this code to find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally."
