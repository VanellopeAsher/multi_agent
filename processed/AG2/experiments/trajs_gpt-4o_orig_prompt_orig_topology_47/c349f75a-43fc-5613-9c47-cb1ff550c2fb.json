You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters.

We will calculate the total age by adding the ages of the brothers and sisters.\n\nSteps:\n1. We have 10 sisters, each 16 years old.\n2. We have 2 brothers. One brother is 12 years old, and the other brother, being twice the age of the 12-year-old brother, is 24 years old.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate the total age.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total age\nnumber_of_sisters = 10\nage_of_each_sister = 16\nage_of_younger_brother = 12\nage_of_older_brother = 24  # twice the age of the younger brother\n\n# Total age of all sisters\ntotal_age_sisters = number_of_sisters * age_of_each_sister\n\n# Total age of both brothers\ntotal_age_brothers = age_of_younger_brother + age_of_older_brother\n\n# Total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_age_sisters + total_age_brothers\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nAfter running the code, we can determine the total age of all the siblings."
