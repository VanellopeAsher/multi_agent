You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80.

Calculate the total number of classes Manny can afford to attend, based on the $20 per class restriction.\n2. Subtract this number from the total number of classes (12) to find out how many classes he can miss.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\n# Variables\ntotal_fee = 80\ncost_per_class_allowed = 20\ntotal_classes = 12\n\n# Let 'x' be the number of classes Manny actually attends\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation: Cost per class <= $20\nequation = Eq(total_fee / x, cost_per_class_allowed)\n\n# Solve the equation for the number of classes Manny needs to attend\nclasses_to_attend = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can miss\nclasses_missed = total_classes - classes_to_attend\n\n# Display result\nprint(f\"Manny can miss at most {classes_missed} classes.\")\n```\n\nBy solving this, we can find the number of classes Manny can afford to miss."
