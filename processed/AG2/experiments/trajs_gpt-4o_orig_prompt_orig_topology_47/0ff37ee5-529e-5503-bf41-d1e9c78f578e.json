You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

Since each $10 bill is worth $10, the total amount from the $10 bills is \\( 10x \\).\n\n2. Ali also has six $20 bills. The total amount from the $20 bills is \\( 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\).\n\n3. Ali's total amount of money is \\( 10x + 120 \\).\n\n4. Ali gives half of his total money to his sister, which means he is left with \\(\\frac{1}{2}(10x + 120)\\).\n\n5. Ali uses 3/5 of this remaining amount to buy dinner, leaving him with $32. Therefore, he spends \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2}(10x + 120)\\) on dinner, and the amount left after buying dinner is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2}(10x + 120) = 32\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of $10 bills Ali originally had using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total money Ali originally had\ntotal_money = 10*x + 120\n\n# Money after giving half to his sister\nremaining_after_giving = total_money / 2\n\n# Money left after buying dinner\nremaining_after_dinner = (2/5) * remaining_after_giving\n\n# Equation that represents the situation\nequation = Eq(remaining_after_dinner, 32)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nRunning this code will yield the number of $10 bills Ali originally had."
