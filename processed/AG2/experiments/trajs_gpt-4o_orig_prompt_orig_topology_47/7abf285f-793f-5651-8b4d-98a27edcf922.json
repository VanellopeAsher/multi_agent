Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

Jessica has three debts: student loans, a credit card, and a mortgage. \n\n### Key Details\n- **Minimum Monthly Payments:**\n  - Student loans: $300\n  - Credit card: $200\n  - Mortgage: $500\n\n- **Additional Details:**\n  - Jessica plans to pay 50% more than the minimum on these debts.\n  - Jessica continues to subscribe to Netflix, but it doesn't contribute to the debt calculation since she has a coupon covering the cost.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment for debts.\n2. Calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment.\n3. Calculate the total amount paid each month by adding the 50% increase.\n4. Calculate the yearly total by multiplying the monthly payment by 12 (months).\n\nLet's calculate these steps using Python.\n\n```python\n# Given minimum payments\nstudent_loan_min = 300\ncredit_card_min = 200\nmortgage_min = 500\n\n# Calculate the total minimum monthly payment\ntotal_min_monthly_payment = student_loan_min + credit_card_min + mortgage_min\n\n# Calculate 50% more than the minimum monthly payment\nadditional_amount = total_min_monthly_payment * 0.5\n\n# Total monthly payment with the additional amount\ntotal_monthly_payment_with_addition = total_min_monthly_payment + additional_amount\n\n# Calculate yearly payment\nyearly_payment = total_monthly_payment_with_addition * 12\n\n# Print the yearly payment\nprint(yearly_payment)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year."
