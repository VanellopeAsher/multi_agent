You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

Finally, we can calculate how many students received the cards based on the number of cards each student got.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, with 25 cards per deck.\n   - She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards per box.\n   - Additionally, she owns a special collection of 30 soccer cards.\n   \n2. **Determine the Number of Cards Given to Students:**\n   - Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.\n   - The remaining cards are given to students.\n   \n3. **Calculate the Number of Students:**\n   - Each student receives 10 cards.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python to find how many students received the cards.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Total number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n\n# Total number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n\n# Total number of soccer cards\nsoccer_cards = 30\n\n# Total number of cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards + soccer_cards\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - 50\n\n# Each student gets 10 cards, solve for number of students\nstudents = symbols('students')\nequation = Eq(students * 10, cards_given_to_students)\nsolution = solve(equation, students)\n\nprint(solution[0])  # This should give the number of students\n```\n\nWhen you run the code, it will calculate and print the number of students Miss Maria has."
