You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

We'll express the total amount paid in terms of the number of pizza boxes and solve for the unknown.\n\nLet's break down the cost items:\n- One chicken meal costs \\$120.\n- Five packs of milk at \\$30 each cost \\( 5 \\times 30 = \\$150 \\).\n- Forty apples at \\$1.50 each cost \\( 40 \\times 1.50 = \\$60 \\).\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of boxes of pizza, each costing \\$57.\n\nThe total amount paid is \\$900, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 120 + 150 + 60 + 57x = 900 \\]\n\nNow we solve for \\( x \\), the number of pizza boxes.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples\nchicken_meal = 120\nmilk = 5 * 30\napples = 40 * 1.5\n\n# Create an equation\ntotal_cost = chicken_meal + milk + apples\nequation = Eq(total_cost + 57 * x, 900)\n\n# Solve for x\nnumber_of_pizzas = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_pizzas)\n```\n\nRun this code to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered."
