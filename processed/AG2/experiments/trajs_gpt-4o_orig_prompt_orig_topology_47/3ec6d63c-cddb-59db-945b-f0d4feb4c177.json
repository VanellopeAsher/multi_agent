You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are 80 deer in a field.  30 percent of them are bucks.  50 percent of the bucks are 6 points.

Calculate the number of bucks from the total number of deer.\n2. Calculate the number of 6 point bucks from the total number of bucks.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Import SymPy to utilize proper fraction display when applicable\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of deer\ntotal_deer = 80\n\n# Percentage of deer that are bucks\npercentage_bucks = Rational(30, 100)\n\n# Calculate the number of bucks\nnum_bucks = total_deer * percentage_bucks\n\n# Percentage of bucks that are 6 points\npercentage_6_point_bucks = Rational(50, 100)\n\n# Calculate the number of 6 point bucks\nnum_6_point_bucks = num_bucks * percentage_6_point_bucks\n\n# Output the result\nprint(num_6_point_bucks)\n```\n\nThis code will output the number of 6 point bucks using fractions, which meets the requirement of providing the answer in fraction/radical form instead of decimals."
