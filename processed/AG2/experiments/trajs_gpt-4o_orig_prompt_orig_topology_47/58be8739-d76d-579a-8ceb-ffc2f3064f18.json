You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow Case 1, as the problem involves some straightforward calculations that can be handled directly with Python code.\n\n**Key Idea:** We need to determine the total time John spent on activities and calculate the sightseeing time based on the percentage provided.\n\nLet's break down the solution step-by-step:\n1. Calculate the time spent on each activity:\n   - Boating: 6 hours.\n   - Swimming: Half the time of boating = 3 hours.\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows, 2 hours each = 3 * 2 = 6 hours.\n   \n2. The total time these activities took is the sum of boating, swimming, and shows:\n   - Total activity time = 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours.\n   \n3. This total activity time represents 30% of the overall time he spent. Therefore, we can calculate the full time spent using the formula:\n   - Total time spent = Total activity time / 0.3\n   \n4. Once we have the total time, the sightseeing time can be calculated as:\n   - Sightseeing time = Total time spent - Total activity time\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Times spent on activities\nboating_time = 6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 3 * 2\n\n# Total time spent on the activities\ntotal_activity_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time\n\n# Compute the total vacation time using the given percentage\ntotal_time = total_activity_time / Rational(30, 100)\n\n# Compute the time spent sightseeing\nsightseeing_time = total_time - total_activity_time\n\n# Print the result using the Rational form\nprint('Total time spent:', total_time)\nprint('Sightseeing time:', sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nThis will provide you the total time spent and the sightseeing time in rational forms. Let's run this code and see the result."
