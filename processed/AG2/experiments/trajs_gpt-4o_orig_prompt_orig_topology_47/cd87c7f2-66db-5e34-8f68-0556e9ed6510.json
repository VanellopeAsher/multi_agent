You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.

Calculate the total number of balloons at the start.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end to find out how many balloons were thrown.\n\nWe'll translate these steps into Python code.\n\n```python\n# Total number of packs\npacks = 10\n\n# Balloons per pack\nballoons_per_pack = 100\n\n# Total initial number of balloons\ntotal_balloons = packs * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Balloons left after the fight\nballoons_left = 120\n\n# Balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will give you the number of balloons thrown during the water balloon fight. Please execute the code to find the answer."
