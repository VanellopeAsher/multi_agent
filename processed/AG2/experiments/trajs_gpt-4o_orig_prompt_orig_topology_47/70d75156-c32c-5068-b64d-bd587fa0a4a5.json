Each box contains 20 oranges.\n\n### Solution Steps\n1. **Determine Initial Conditions:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of boxes initially.\n   - Therefore, total oranges = \\( 20x \\).\n\n2. **Oranges Given Away:**\n   - Oranges given away = \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Oranges After Giving Away:**\n   - Remaining oranges = \\( 20x - 80 \\).\n\n4. **Oranges Mrs. Harrington Kept:**\n   - She keeps 1/4 of the remaining oranges, hence kept oranges = \\( \\frac{1}{4}(20x - 80) \\).\n\n5. **Oranges Sold:**\n   - Sold oranges = Remaining oranges - kept oranges = \\( 20x - 80 - \\frac{1}{4}(20x - 80) \\).\n\nNow we will find the solution assuming a simple real-world scenario.
