Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many crayon muffins Kate can make and use the total sales to find out the price per muffin crayon.\n\nKey steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of crayons.\n2. Determine how many crayon muffins can be made from the total number of crayons.\n3. Use the total sales amount to determine the price per muffin crayon.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Crayons**:\n   - Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. So, the total number of crayons is \\(3 \\times 64\\).\n\n2. **Number of Crayon Muffins**:\n   - Each muffin is made by melting 8 crayons. To find out the number of muffins, divide the total number of crayons by 8.\n\n3. **Price Per Muffin Crayon**:\n   - Divide the total sales amount ($36) by the number of muffins to find out how much each muffin sells for.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate total number of crayons\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# Step 2: Calculate number of muffin crayons\nmuffins = total_crayons // 8\n\n# Step 3: Calculate price per muffin crayon\ntotal_sales = 36  # dollars\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(total_sales, muffins)\n\n# Print price per muffin\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will provide the price per muffin crayon in fraction form."

      "content": "Great! The calculation shows that each muffin crayon sells for \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) dollars, or $1.50. This result makes sense because with 3 boxes of 64 crayons, you have \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\) crayons total. Dividing the crayons into groups of 8 gives \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\) muffins. If $36 is earned from selling all muffins, then dividing the total earnings by 24 muffins gives \\(\\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2}\\) dollars per muffin.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\\)."
