You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon.

We're given that the price of a one-gallon jar is \\$5.\n2. A one-gallon jar costs \\$2 more than a half-gallon jar.\n3. We'll first calculate the price of a half-gallon jar.\n4. Then, we'll calculate the total cost for 10 one-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.\n\nLet's solve this problem with Python:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to work with rational arithmetic if needed (not actually needed here since everything is integral).\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices\nprice_one_gallon = 5\nprice_half_gallon = price_one_gallon - 2\n\n# Number of jars\none_gallon_jars = 10\nhalf_gallon_jars = 16\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = one_gallon_jars * price_one_gallon + half_gallon_jars * price_half_gallon\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will output the sum of money Cecelia expended on purchasing the jars.
