  "problem": "It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's follow the steps below:\n\n1. Define Variables:\n   - Let \\( t \\) be the number of packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought.\n   - We know she bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n\n2. Set up Equations:\n   - The cost for tomato seeds is \\( 40t \\).\n   - The cost for celery seeds is \\( 30 \\times 80 \\).\n   - The total cost for all seeds is $3200.\n\n3. Formulate the equation to find \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   40t + 30 \\times 80 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve this equation for \\( t \\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy to perform the algebraic manipulation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nt = symbols('t')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(40 * t + 30 * 80, 3200)\n\n# Solve the equation for t\nnumber_of_tomato_packets = solve(equation, t)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_tomato_packets)\n```\n\nThis code will give the number of packets of tomato seeds she bought. After getting the solution, we can put the answer in the box format \\(\\boxed{}\\). Let's run this code to get the result."
