You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

Calculate the total time spent on different activities mentioned in the problem.\n2. Use percentages to find out the total amount of time John spent on vacation.\n3. Calculate the amount of time spent on sightseeing using the percentage.\n\nLet's proceed with this step-by-step solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define a variable for the unknown total time spent on vacation\ntotal_time = symbols('total_time')\n\n# Calculate the time John spent on each activity\ntime_boating = 6.6  # hours\ntime_swimming = 6.6 / 2  # half the boating time\ntime_shows = 3 * 2.5  # 3 shows, each lasting 2.5 hours\n\n# Calculate total known time spent\ntotal_known_time = time_boating + time_swimming + time_shows\n\n# 30% of the total time was spent on the activities above\n# Formulate the equation: 0.3 * total_time = total_known_time\nequation = Eq(0.3 * total_time, total_known_time)\n\n# Solve for total_time\ntotal_time_value = solve(equation, total_time)[0]\n\n# Calculate the time spent sightseeing which was 40% of the total time\ntime_sightseeing = 0.4 * total_time_value\n\n# Print the results in fraction form\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(\"Total time spent on vacation:\", total_time_value)\nprint(\"Time spent sightseeing:\", Rational(time_sightseeing).limit_denominator())\n```\n\nThis will give us the time John spent on sightseeing, expressed in a fraction. Let's run this code to obtain the result."
