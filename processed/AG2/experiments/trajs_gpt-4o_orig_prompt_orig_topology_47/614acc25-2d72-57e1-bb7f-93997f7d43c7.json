You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nLast night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting.

Let \\( c_t \\) be the number of cougars killed today.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- Last night, \\( w_n = 10 \\).\n- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars: \\( w_t = 3c_t \\).\n- Rick killed three fewer cougars today than last night: \\( c_t = c_n - 3 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of animals Rick killed across both nights:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total animals} = w_n + c_n + w_t + c_t\n\\]\n\nLet's translate this into Python using sympy to solve for the variables and obtain the total number of animals killed.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nc_n, c_t = symbols('c_n c_t')\n\n# Set up the equations based on the given conditions\nequations = [\n    Eq(c_t, c_n - 3),  # Today, three fewer cougars than last night\n    Eq(3 * c_t, 10 + c_n - 3)  # Today killed three times as many wolves as cougars\n]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve(equations, (c_n, c_t))\nc_n_value = solution[c_n]\nc_t_value = solution[c_t]\n\n# Calculate the total number of animals killed\nw_n = 10  # given from the problem statement\nw_t = 3 * c_t_value\ntotal_animals = w_n + c_n_value + w_t + c_t_value\n\n# Print the result\nprint('Total number of animals killed =', total_animals)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of animals Rick killed over the two days."
