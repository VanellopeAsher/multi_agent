You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCaroline has 4 children.

First Child: \\( x \\) feet\n2. Second Child: \\( x \\) feet + 2 inches\n3. Third Child: Second Child's height - 5 inches\n4. Fourth Child: Third Child's height + 3 inches\n\nWe know the Fourth Child is 72 inches tall. Let's solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Convert the first child's height to inches: \\( x \\) feet = \\( 12x \\) inches\n2. Second Child's height: \\( 12x + 2 \\) inches\n3. Third Child's height: \\( (12x + 2) - 5 \\) inches\n4. Fourth Child's height: \\( (12x + 2 - 5) + 3 \\) inches\n\nThe equation based on the given details is:\n\\[ (12x + 2 - 5 + 3) = 72 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation: Fourth Child's height = 72\n# (12x + 2 - 5 + 3) = 72\nequation = Eq((12*x + 2 - 5 + 3), 72)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the first child's height in feet\nprint(f'The first child is {solution[0]} feet tall.')\n```"
