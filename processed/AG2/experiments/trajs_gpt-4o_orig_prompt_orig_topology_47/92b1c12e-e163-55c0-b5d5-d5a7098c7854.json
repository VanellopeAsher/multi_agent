You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.

Carver's age (\\( C \\)) is 45.\n2. Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter, which gives us the equation: \n   \\[\n   C = 2D - 5\n   \\]\n3. The daughter is 4 years older than three times the son's age:\n   \\[\n   D = 3S + 4\n   \\]\n\nNow, we will substitute \\( C = 45 \\) into the first equation to find \\( D \\), and then use the second equation to find \\( S \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nC, D, S = symbols('C D S', integer=True)\n\n# given C = 45\nC_value = 45\n\n# Equation 1: C = 2D - 5\neq1 = Eq(C_value, 2 * D - 5)\n\n# Equation 2: D = 3S + 4\neq2 = Eq(D, 3 * S + 4)\n\n# Solving the equations\nsolutions = solve((eq1, eq2), (D, S))\n\n# Calculate the son's age\nson_age = solutions[S]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(son_age)\n```\nWhen you execute this code, it will provide the son's age, which is what we are looking for."
