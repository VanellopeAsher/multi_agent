You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

      "content": "To find out how much Walter's lawyer contributes, we need to determine the total amount donated by Walter's neighbors, the online fund, and his friend. The lawyer then donates three times this total amount. Let's proceed to calculate this.\n\n1. Calculate the total amount donated excluding the lawyer:\n   - Neighbors contribute $300.\n   - Online fund contributes $1200.\n   - Friend contributes $120.\n   - Total contribution excluding the lawyer is the sum of these amounts.\n\n2. Calculate the lawyer's donation as three times the total contribution excluding himself.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic mathematics\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the contributions\nneighbors_contribution = 300\nonline_fund_contribution = 1200\nfriend_contribution = 120\n\n# Total contribution excluding the lawyer\ntotal_excluding_lawyer = neighbors_contribution + online_fund_contribution + friend_contribution\n\n# Lawyer's contribution is three times the above total\nlawyers_contribution = 3 * total_excluding_lawyer\n\n# Print the lawyer's contribution\nprint(lawyers_contribution)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the lawyer's contribution based on the total other contributions."
