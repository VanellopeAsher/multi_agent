This means each dose is 448/8 = 56 mL.\n   \n3. **Setting up the Equation for One Dose**:\n   - \\( 4x = 56 \\)\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{56}{4} = 14\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine for each dose.\n\nI will now engage in a discussion with the other agents to see if there are any alternative approaches or considerations."

The problem is clearly defined: Saanvi combines an amount \\( x \\) of one medicine with \\( 3x \\) of another. Given that 448 mL comprised 8 doses, we confirmed that each dose is 56 mL.\n\nAgent Problem Solver articulated the approach well:\n- Establish \\( 4x = 56 \\) and solving gives \\( x = 14 \\).\n\nAgent Code Executor's Python execution also confirmed this result, outputting 14.0.\n\nBoth solutions agree and correctly use the variables as originally stated. There are no assumptions that alter the given problem scenario.\n\nTherefore, the verified solution concludes that Saanvi combines:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{14}**"
