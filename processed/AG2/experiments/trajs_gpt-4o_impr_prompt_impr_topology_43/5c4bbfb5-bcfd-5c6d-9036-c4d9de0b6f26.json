Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon.

      "content": "In order to determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to break down the cost of each item she's purchasing and compare the total cost to her budget.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of bacon:**\n   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total.\n   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is $10.5 / 5 = $2.1.\n   \n2. **Calculate the cost of chicken:**\n   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\n   - Therefore, each packet of chicken costs 2 * $2.1 = $4.2.\n   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is 6 * $4.2 = $25.2.\n   \n3. **Calculate the cost of strawberries:**\n   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.5.\n   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is 3 * $4.5 = $13.5.\n   \n4. **Calculate the cost of apples:**\n   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, i.e., $4.5 / 2 = $2.25.\n   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is 7 * $2.25 = $15.75.\n   \n5. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples.\n   - Total cost = $10.5 + $25.2 + $13.5 + $15.75 = $64.95.\n   \n6. **Determine remaining budget:**\n   - Kelly's budget is $65.\n   - Remaining budget = Budget - Total cost.\n   - Remaining budget = $65 - $64.95 = $0.05.\n\nSo, Kelly has $0.05 left in her budget after purchasing all the items."

Total cost for 6 packets is \\($4.2 \\times 6 = $25.2\\).\n   - Strawberries: Each pack costs $4.5, totaling \\($4.5 \\times 3 = $13.5\\).\n   - Apples: Each costs half as much as a pack of strawberries, i.e., $2.25. Total cost for 7 packs is \\($2.25 \\times 7 = $15.75\\).\n\n2. **Total Cost Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 10.5 + 25.2 + 13.5 + 15.75 = 64.95\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remaining Budget:**\n   \\[\\text{Remaining budget} = 65 - 64.95 = 0.05\\]\n\nAgent Problem Solver calculated the remaining budget as $0.05, while the code provided by Agent Code Executor resulted in a number very close to $0.05 (due to floating-point arithmetic precision issues).\n\nUpon verifying, both solutions effectively arrive at Kelly having $0.05 left in her budget when rounded appropriately. Therefore, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{0.05}**"
