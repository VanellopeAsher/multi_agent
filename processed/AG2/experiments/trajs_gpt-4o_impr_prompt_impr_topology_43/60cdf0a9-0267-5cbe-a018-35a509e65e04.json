Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she sold all her muffin crayons and made $36, how much each muffin crayon sells for?",

In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve the problem, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Crayon Pieces**:  \n   Kate took home 3 boxes, and each box contains 64 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 64 = 192 \\text{ crayon pieces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Muffin Crayons Made**:  \n   Since each muffin crayon is made by melting 8 small pieces together, we need to calculate how many muffin crayons Kate can make:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{192}{8} = 24 \\text{ muffin crayons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Selling Price per Muffin Crayon**:  \n   Kate sold all her muffin crayons for a total of $36. Therefore, the selling price for each muffin crayon is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{24} = 1.5 \\text{ dollars per muffin crayon}\n   \\]\n\nHence, each muffin crayon sells for $1.50."
