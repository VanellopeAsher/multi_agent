Here's a breakdown of the costs:\n\n1. **Spaying Cost**: \n   - The cost of spaying is given as $200.\n\n2. **Vaccine Costs**: \n   - Each vaccine costs $20, and there are 3 vaccines.\n   - Total vaccine cost without discount = 3 * $20 = $60.\n   - Leah received a 10% discount on the total vaccine cost.\n   - Amount of discount = 10% of $60 = 0.10 * $60 = $6.\n   - Total vaccine cost with discount = $60 - $6 = $54.\n\n3. **Cost of Broken Vases**:\n   - Each vase costs $12, and the kitten broke 4 vases.\n   - Total cost for broken vases = 4 * $12 = $48.\n\nAdding up all the costs gives us the total expenditure by Leah:\n\n- Total cost = Spaying cost + Vaccine cost (after discount) + Cost of broken vases\n- Total cost = $200 + $54 + $48 = $302\n\nThus, the kitten has cost Leah $302 so far."
