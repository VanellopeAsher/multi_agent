Since he delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson, the number of messages to Mr. Yu is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 84 = 28\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of messages delivered.\n\nTo find the total number of messages James delivers, add the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and the messages delivered to Mr. Yu:\n\n\\[\n84 + 28 = 112\n\\]\n\nSo, James delivers a total of 112 messages."
