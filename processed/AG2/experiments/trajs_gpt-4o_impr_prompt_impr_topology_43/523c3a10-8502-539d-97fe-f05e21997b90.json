      "content": "To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we need to follow a few steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of S'mores Needed:**\n   - Each of the 9 children wants 2 s'mores, so the total number s'mores for the children is: \n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ children} \\times 2 \\text{ s'mores/child} = 18 \\text{ s'mores}\n     \\]\n   - Each of the 6 adults wants 1 s'more, so the total number of s'mores for the adults is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ adults} \\times 1 \\text{ s'more/adult} = 6 \\text{ s'mores}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total S'mores Needed:**\n   - Add the number of s'mores needed for the children and adults: \n     \\[\n     18 \\text{ s'mores (children)} + 6 \\text{ s'mores (adults)} = 24 \\text{ s'mores total}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Graham Cracker Packets Needed:**\n   - Each packet can make bases for 8 s'mores, so:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{24 \\text{ s'mores needed}}{8 \\text{ s'mores/packet}} = 3 \\text{ packets}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Boxes Needed:**\n   - Since each box contains 3 packets, divide the total packets needed by the number of packets per box:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 \\text{ packets needed}}{3 \\text{ packets/box}} = 1 \\text{ box}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, only 1 box of graham crackers is necessary to make the required 24 s'mores."

The expected output should be `1`, confirming that only 1 box of graham crackers is necessary. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent_Verifier"
