      "content": "I'm going to verify and cross-check the solution provided by Agent Problem Solver using a structured approach:\n\n1. **Calculation of Richard's Cherries**:\n   - Since Robert has 3000 cherries and this is 1000 more than Richard's, we calculate Richard's cherries as follows:\n     \\[\n     R = 3000 - 1000 = 2000\n     \\]\n\n2. **Total Cherries**:\n   - The problem states the total number of cherries between Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 6000.\n\n3. **Calculate Jerry's Cherries**:\n   - We know Richard has 2000 cherries and Robert has 3000, adding up to 5000.\n   - Consequently, Jerry's cherries can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     J = 6000 - 5000 = 1000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Difference in Cherries between Robert and Jerry**:\n   - Robert has 3000 cherries and Jerry has 1000, hence the difference:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, after verifying, Robert does indeed have 2000 more cherries than Jerry.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2000}**"
