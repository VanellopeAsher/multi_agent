Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand Polly's Throwing Range with the Gemstone**: Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 4,000 feet. Holding the sapphire gemstone increases her range to three times that distance:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Throwing distance with gemstone} = 3 \\times 4,000 = 12,000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Range of the Dragon's Flames**: The dragon's flames reach up to 10,000 feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the Safe Distance for Polly**: Polly needs to stand at a spot where her throwing range allows the javelin to reach the dragon, but she is outside of the reach of the dragon's flames.\n\n   To be outside the flame range and still hit the dragon:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum distance Polly can safely stand} = \\text{Throwing distance with gemstone} - \\text{Flame range}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum distance} = 12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Polly can stand 2,000 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the javelin. This ensures she is safe from the dragon's fire while still being able to effectively throw the javelin.\n\nIn summary, Polly can safely stand at 12,000 feet from the dragon (2,000 feet outside the dragon's 10,000-foot flame reach) while holding the gemstone."
