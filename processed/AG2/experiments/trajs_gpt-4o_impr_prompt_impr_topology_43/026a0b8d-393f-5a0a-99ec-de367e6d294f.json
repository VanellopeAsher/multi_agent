She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

      "content": "Sure, let's work through this problem step by step.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( x \\) as the number of packets of tomato seeds.\n- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.\n- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.\n- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n\nWe know that the total cost for all the seed packets is $3200. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[\n40x + 30 \\times 80 = 3200\n\\]\n\nLet's now solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, calculate how much she spent on celery seeds:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 80 = 2400\n\\]\n\nNow substitute this back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n40x + 2400 = 3200\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2400 from both sides to solve for \\( 40x \\):\n\n\\[\n40x = 800\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 40:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{800}{40} = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds."
