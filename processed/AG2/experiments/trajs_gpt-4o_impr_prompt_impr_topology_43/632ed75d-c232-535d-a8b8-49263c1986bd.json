The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll start by defining the variables and translating the problem details into mathematical expressions.\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the total number of daily flights made by the first aircraft.\n\n2. **Set Up the Relationships**:\n   - According to the problem, the second aircraft makes 44 flights, which is half of the total flights made by the first aircraft. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     x = 88\n     \\]\n   So, the first aircraft makes a total of 88 flights daily.\n\n3. **Break Down Flight Destinations**:\n   - The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its flights. Hence, the number of flights to Greece is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n     \\]\n   - The remaining flights are divided equally between France and Germany. To find the number of remaining flights:\n     \\[\n     88 - 66 = 22\n     \\]\n   - These 22 flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n     \\]\n\nSo, the first aircraft makes 11 flights to France each day."
