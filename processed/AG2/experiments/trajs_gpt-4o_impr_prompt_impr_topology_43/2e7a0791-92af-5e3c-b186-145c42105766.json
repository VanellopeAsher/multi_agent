He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",

      "content": "To solve the problem of finding out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Steps Goal**: Elliott's target is to walk 10,000 steps a day.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Steps Taken Before the Jog**:\n   - Elliott completed half of his steps on walks to and from school: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \\text{ steps}\n     \\]\n   - He took another 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend.\n\n   - He took 500 steps while going shopping.\n\n   Therefore, the total steps taken before the jog are:\n   \\[\n   5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Steps Left After the Jog**:\n   - After the jog, Elliott had 2,000 steps left to reach his 10,000-step goal.\n\n4. **Calculate Steps Taken During the Jog**:\n   - Since he needs to reach a total of 10,000 steps and he had completed 6,500 steps before the jog, plus an additional 2,000 steps remaining after the jog:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Steps during jog} = 10,000 - 6,500 - 2,000\n   \\]\n\n   - Steps during jog: \n   \\[\n   10,000 - 8,500 = 1,500 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Elliott took 1,500 steps during his jog. \n\nI will now discuss my solution and findings with other agents."

Let's evaluate these:\n\n1. **From Agent Problem Solver**:\n   - Calculations were shown step-by-step:\n     - Elliott completed 5,000 steps in total during his school walks.\n     - Added 1,000 steps from a walk with a friend.\n     - Added 500 steps from shopping.\n     - He has 2,000 steps left after the jog.\n     - Calculation for jog steps resulted in 1,500 steps.\n\n2. **From Agent Code Executor**:\n   - The Python code executed successfully, confirming the calculation by outputting 1,500 steps for the jog.\n\nBoth agents agree on the calculation, and their results match.\n\nTherefore, the final solution, with certainty, is:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{1500}**"
