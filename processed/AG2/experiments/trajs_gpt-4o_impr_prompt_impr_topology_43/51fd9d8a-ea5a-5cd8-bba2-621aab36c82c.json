So Paul's age \\( P \\) can be represented as:\n     \\[\n     P = J + (0.1 \\times 100) = J + 10\n     \\]\n\n   - Peter’s age is the sum of Paul's and John's age. So Peter's age \\( A \\) is:\n     \\[\n     A = P + J = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute into Combined Age Equation**:\n\n   Substitute Peter's and Paul's expressions in the combined age equation:\n\n   \\[\n   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + \\text{Jean's age} = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for Jean's Age**:\n\n   Let Jean's age be denoted as \\( Q \\). Therefore, we have:\n   \n   \\[\n   2J + 10 + J + 10 + Q = 100\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   3J + 20 + Q = 100\n   \\]\n\n   Rearrange to find:\n   \n   \\[\n   Q = 100 - 3J - 20\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   Q = 80 - 3J\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclude Peter's Age**:\n   \n   Since we only need Peter's age and we understand it in terms of \\( J \\), we can express Peter's age further depending on \\( J \\).\n\nUsing these equations we can interpret and further calculate if we had the exact value of either John or Jean's age. This provides a structural view of the relationships until more specific values or conditions are provided."
