Since he earns $300 per day and he worked for an entire week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 300 \\text{ (dollar/day)} \\times 7 \\text{ (days)} = 2100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Remaining Money**: Next, we calculate how much money Gerald has left after spending $1000 from his total earnings.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining Money} = \\text{Total Earnings} - \\text{Total Spent} = 2100 \\text{ dollars} - 1000 \\text{ dollars} = 1100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Gerald has $1100 left after spending $1000.\n\nI will now engage with Agent_Code_Executor to see if a code implementation or any further discussion is necessary."
