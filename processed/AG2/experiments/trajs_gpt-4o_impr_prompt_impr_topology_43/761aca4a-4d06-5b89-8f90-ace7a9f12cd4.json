The water level rises by an additional 7 feet. \n   - Calculation: \\( 17 \\text{ feet} + 7 \\text{ feet} = 24 \\text{ feet} \\)\n\n3. **Wednesday's Water Depth**: The water level on Wednesday decreased to two-thirds of Tuesday's depth.\n   - Calculation for Wednesday: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 \\text{ feet} = 16 \\text{ feet} \\)\n\nTherefore, the water depth in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.\n\nLet's now discuss this approach to ensure we have covered every aspect correctly."

Now, let's proceed by implementing the solution as a Python script to confirm it programmatically.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
