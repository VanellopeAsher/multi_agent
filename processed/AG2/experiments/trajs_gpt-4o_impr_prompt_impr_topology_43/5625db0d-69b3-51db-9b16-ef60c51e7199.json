      "content": "To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the apples on the two days, I will calculate the total cost for both Clara and Sheila, incorporating their respective discounts.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost for Clara\n\n1. Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each. \n   - Total cost without discount: \\( 15 \\text{ apples} \\times \\$15/\\text{apple} = \\$225 \\).\n\n2. Clara had a $3 discount voucher.\n   - Total cost after discount: \\( \\$225 - \\$3 = \\$222 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost for Sheila\n\n1. The next day, the price of apples increased to $25 each. Sheila also bought 15 apples.\n   - Total cost without discount: \\( 15 \\text{ apples} \\times \\$25/\\text{apple} = \\$375 \\).\n\n2. Sheila received a 15% discount on the total cost.\n   - Discount amount: \\( 15\\% \\times \\$375 = 0.15 \\times \\$375 = \\$56.25 \\).\n   - Total cost after discount: \\( \\$375 - \\$56.25 = \\$318.75 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Difference in Final Prices\n\n- Difference in total cost: \\( \\$318.75 - \\$222 = \\$96.75 \\).\n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is \\( \\$96.75 \\)."

Let's evaluate and verify them:\n\n1. **Calculation for Clara:**\n   - Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each, totaling $225.\n   - She used a $3 discount voucher, reducing her total to $222.\n\n2. **Calculation for Sheila:**\n   - Sheila bought 15 apples at the increased price of $25 each, totaling $375.\n   - She received a 15% discount on the total, amounting to $56.25.\n   - After the discount, Sheila's total cost is $318.75.\n\n3. **Difference between the final prices:**\n   - Sheila's total cost was $318.75, and Clara's was $222.\n   - Difference in costs is $318.75 - $222 = $96.75.\n\nBoth solutions agree and are consistent with each other.
