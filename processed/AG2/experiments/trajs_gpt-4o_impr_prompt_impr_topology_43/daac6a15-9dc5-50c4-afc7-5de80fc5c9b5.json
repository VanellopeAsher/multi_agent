However, if we assume Derrick sells `n` doughnuts per day consistently throughout June, you can fill in `n` accordingly to determine the revenue. Once the daily sales count is known, the total can easily be calculated using the formula above. \n\nPlease provide the number of doughnuts sold per day if you'd like a specific monetary amount for June's earnings, ensuring we can formulate the final calculation."
