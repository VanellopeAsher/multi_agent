The formula for the mean of a set of numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of all scores}}{\\text{Number of scores}}\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, we know the mean score is 70, and we have 9 scores in total including the forgotten one.\n\n1. **Calculate the sum of known scores**: \n\n\\[\n50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570\n\\]\n\n2. **Use the mean to set up the equation**:\n\nSince the mean score is 70, the sum of all 9 scores must be:\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 9 = 630\n\\]\n\n3. **Find the sum needed from the forgotten score**:\n\nThe sum needed (total sum) is 630, and the sum of the known scores is 570. Therefore, the forgotten score (\\(x\\)) can be found by subtracting the sum of known scores from the total sum.\n\n\\[\nx = 630 - 570 = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, the forgotten score is 60."
