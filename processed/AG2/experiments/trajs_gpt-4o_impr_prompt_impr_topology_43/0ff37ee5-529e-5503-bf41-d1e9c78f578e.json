      "content": "To find the number of $10 bills Ali originally had, let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information**: \n   - Ali has some $10 bills and six $20 bills.\n   - Total money is split: half is given to his sister, and 3/5 of the remaining money is spent on dinner.\n   - Ali is left with $32 after buying the dinner.\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation**:\n   - Denote the number of $10 bills as \\( x \\).\n   - The total value of $10 bills is \\( 10x \\).\n   - The total value from $20 bills is \\( 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\).\n   - The overall total money Ali has initially is \\( 10x + 120 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Money After Giving to His Sister**:\n   - Ali gives half of his total money to his sister:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining money after giving to sister} = \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Money Spent on Dinner**:\n   - 3/5 of the remaining money was used for dinner:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Money spent on dinner} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Equation for Remaining Money**:\n   - After dinner, Ali has $32. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{10x + 120}{2} = 32\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve the Equation**:\n   - Simplify and solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{5} \\times (5x + 60) = 32\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2x + 24 = 32\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2x = 32 - 24\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2x = 8\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 4\n     \\]\n\nThus, Ali originally had 4 ten-dollar bills. I would now like to engage in discussion with other agents to cross-check the solution."
