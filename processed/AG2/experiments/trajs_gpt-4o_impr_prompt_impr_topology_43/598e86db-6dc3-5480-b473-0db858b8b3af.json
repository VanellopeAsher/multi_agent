      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to start by determining the total number of days Billy works between March 1st and April 19th, accounting for the days he takes off. Then, we'll use the information about the total number of people he helps and the number of hours he works each day to find out how many people he helps per hour.\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Days**:\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April has 19 days up to April 19th.\n   - Total days from March 1st to April 19th = 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\n2. **Determine Days Off**:\n   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.\n   - Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 × 50 = 10 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Working Days**:\n   - Total working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Hours Worked**:\n   - Billy works 3 hours per day.\n   - Total hours worked = 40 days × 3 hours/day = 120 hours.\n\n5. **Total People Helped**:\n   - Billy helps 240 people in total.\n\n6. **Calculate the Number of People Helped Per Hour**:\n   - People helped per hour = Total people helped / Total hours worked.\n   - People helped per hour = 240 / 120 = 2 people per hour.\n\nTherefore, Billy helps 2 people per hour."
