      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of ribbon Monica has available for making bows and distribute it equally among all the gifts she is wrapping.\n\nLet's break down the tasks:\n\n1. **Count the Total Number of Gifts:**\n   - Monica has 6 gifts for her family.\n   - She has 4 gifts for her friends.\n   - She has 2 gifts for her teachers.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of gifts is:\n   \\[\n   6 + 4 + 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Amount of Ribbon Available:**\n   For the sake of this solution, let's assume Monica has a total ribbon length \\( R \\). Without knowing the exact value of \\( R \\), we won't be able to calculate the inches of ribbon per gift. Therefore, if the total ribbon length \\( R \\) is provided, we can proceed with the following calculation:\n   \n3. **Determine the Ribbon per Gift Bow:**\n   To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we would divide the total amount of ribbon \\( R \\) by the total number of gifts.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ribbon per gift} = \\frac{R}{12}\n   \\]\n\nIn summary, without knowing the total ribbon length \\( R \\), we cannot specify the exact ribbon inches per gift bow. But mathematically, it will be \\( R/12 \\), where \\( R \\) is the total length of the ribbon available. If \\( R \\) is provided, we can calculate the precise amount of ribbon per gift bow. \n\nLet's discuss this with Agent_Code_Executor and see if there are any additional steps or calculations needed."

Agent Problem Solver highlighted the importance of knowing the total ribbon length to determine how much ribbon Monica can use per gift.
