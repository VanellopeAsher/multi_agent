      "content": "To find out the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Weight Loss Required:**  \n   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Calorie Deficit Required:**  \n   Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, he needs a total calorie deficit of:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ lbs} \\times 3500 \\text{ calories/lb} = 105,000 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Frame:**  \n   From December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 and a half months. We'll calculate the exact number of days:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 or 29 days (since the problem doesn't specify a year, we'll assume 28)\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - Up to July 19th: 19 days\n\n   Therefore, the total number of days is:\n   \\[\n   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Required Daily Calorie Deficit:**  \n   Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{105,000 \\text{ calories}}{200 \\text{ days}} = 525 \\text{ calories/day}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to meet his weight loss goal by July 19th."

They calculated the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his weight loss goal by considering the total weight loss requirement, the calories associated with each pound of weight loss, and the number of days available to reach this goal.\n\n**Solution Process Recap:**\n1. Andy needs to lose 30 pounds.\n2. It requires a calorie deficit of 3500 per pound to lose weight.\n3. The total calories that need to be burnt are \\(30 \\times 3500 = 105,000\\) calories.\n4. The period from December 31st to July 19th is approximately 200 days.\n5. The daily calorie deficit is \\( \\frac{105,000}{200} = 525 \\) calories per day.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{525}**"
