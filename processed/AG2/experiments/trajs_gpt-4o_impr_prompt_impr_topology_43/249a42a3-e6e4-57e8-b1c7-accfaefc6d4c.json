The total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is calculated as 50 days.\n2. Billy takes 20% of those days off, resulting in 10 days off.\n3. Therefore, he works on 40 days.\n4. Billy helps 7 people per working day because he helps 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours.\n5. Multiplying the number of people he helps per day by the number of working days gives the total number of people he helps.\n\nBoth the manual calculation and the Python code give us the same result:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{280}**"
