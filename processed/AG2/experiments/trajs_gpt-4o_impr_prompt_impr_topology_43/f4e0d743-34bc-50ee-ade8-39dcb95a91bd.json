      "content": "To calculate how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we'll need to determine the total spending for each item and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Food**:\n   - Food costs $25 per week.\n   - There are 4 weeks in a month.\n   - Therefore, monthly food cost = 4 weeks * $25/week = $100 per month.\n   - Annually, the food cost = $100/month * 12 months = $1,200 per year.\n   \n2. **Treats**:\n   - Treats cost $20 per month.\n   - Annually, the treats cost = $20/month * 12 months = $240 per year.\n\n3. **Medicine**:\n   - Medicine costs $100 per month.\n   - Annually, the medicine cost = $100/month * 12 months = $1,200 per year.\n\n4. **Special Shampoo**:\n   - The special shampoo costs $15 per month.\n   - Annually, the shampoo cost = $15/month * 12 months = $180 per year.\n\n5. **Toy**:\n   - The toy costs $10 every two months.\n   - That means she buys 6 toys in a year (since 12 months / 2 months per toy = 6 toys).\n   - Annually, the toy cost = 6 toys * $10/toy = $60 per year.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the yearly expenses:\n\n- Total yearly cost = Food cost + Treats cost + Medicine cost + Shampoo cost + Toy cost\n- Total yearly cost = $1,200 + $240 + $1,200 + $180 + $60 = $2,880\n\nTherefore, Madeline spends $2,880 per year on her dog."
