  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",
