Calculate the total cost for the tablet and headphones:\n   - Tablet and headphones cost = \\(330 + 137 = 467\\) dollars\n3. Calculate the total expenses:\n   - Total expenses = \\(3500 + 467 = 3967\\) dollars\n4. Determine the change to be returned:\n   - Change = \\(4000 - 3967 = 33\\) dollars\n\nSo, the seller will return $33 in change. \n\nI will now implement this solution into Python code.
