If you happen to have this information, please share it, or if you intended for us to infer a reasonable number, let us know so I can proceed accordingly. \n\nThe formula for the balloons thrown will be quite straightforward once we have the number of packs.

      "content": "It seems we need the specific number of packs to determine how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw. Without this input, I'll develop a flexible piece of code that can calculate the result when the number of packs is specified.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation using a hypothetical example (e.g., 3 packs), which you can adjust easily later.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of packs of balloons\nnumber_of_packs = 3  # Hypothetical number, adjust as needed\n\n# Each pack contains 30 balloons\nballoons_per_pack = 30\n\n# Total balloons at the start\ntotal_balloons = number_of_packs * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Balloons left\nballoons_left = 12\n\n# Calculate balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\n# Print the result\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nThis code allows you to adjust `number_of_packs` to any number you receive or decide upon. With a concrete number of packs, you'll get the exact result. Let me know if this helps or if further clarification is needed.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Verifier"

If the number of packs differs, substitute the actual number of packs in the code to compute the correct number of balloons thrown.\n\nIf further detail on the number of packs is available or if there's any uncertainty, providing this information will refine the outcome accurately."
