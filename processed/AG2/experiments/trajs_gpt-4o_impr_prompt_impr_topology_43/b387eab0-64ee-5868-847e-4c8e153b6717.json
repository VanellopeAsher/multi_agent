      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost Before Discounts and Cashbacks:**\n   - If the gas is priced at $3.00 per gallon and the person buys 10 gallons, the total cost would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost} = 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$3.00/\\text{gallon} = \\$30.00\n     \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Cashback:**\n   - The cashback offer is $0.20 per gallon. Therefore, for 10 gallons, the cashback is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cashback} = 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$0.20/\\text{gallon} = \\$2.00\n     \\]\n   - The cost after applying the cashback is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost After Cashback} = \\$30.00 - \\$2.00 = \\$28.00\n     \\]\n\n3. **Apply the 10% Discount Coupon:**\n   - The coupon gives a 10% discount on the total price after applying the cashback. Therefore, the discount amount is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Discount} = 10\\% \\times \\$28.00 = 0.10 \\times \\$28.00 = \\$2.80\n     \\]\n   - The final cost after applying the discount is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Final Cost} = \\$28.00 - \\$2.80 = \\$25.20\n     \\]\n\nThus, after applying both the cashback and the coupon, the person will pay **$25.20** for the 10 gallons of gas. \n\nLet me know if you have any thoughts on this approach."
