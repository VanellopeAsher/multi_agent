      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss without exceeding the cost of $20 per class. Let's go through the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Cost per Class if All Classes are Attended:**\n   - If Manny attends all 12 classes, the cost per class is $80/12 = $6.67 per class.\n\n2. **Identify the Threshold Cost per Class:**\n   - His parents have set a threshold of $20 per class.\n   \n3. **Set up the Equation for Missed Classes:**\n   - If Manny misses `m` classes, he will attend `12 - m` classes.\n   - The cost per attended class becomes $80 divided by the number of attended classes: $80 / (12 - m).\n\n4. **Solve for Maximum `m` Where Cost per Class is Less or Equal to $20:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{12 - m} \\leq 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify and Solve the Inequality:**\n\n   - Rearranging gives: \\( 80 \\leq 20 \\times (12 - m) \\)\n   - Expanding the multiplication: \\( 80 \\leq 240 - 20m \\)\n   - Rearranging terms gives: \\( 20m \\leq 160 \\)\n   - Dividing through by 20 gives: \\( m \\leq 8 \\)\n\nThus, Manny can miss up to 8 classes while keeping the cost per class at $20 or below. If he misses more than 8 classes, the cost per class will exceed $20, and his parents may decide not to sign him up again."
