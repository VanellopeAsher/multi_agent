      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed on both nights.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Variables for the first night:**  \n   - Let \\( w_1 \\) be the number of wolves killed on the first night.\n   - Let \\( c_1 \\) be the number of cougars killed on the first night.\n\n   We know from the problem statement that Rick killed 10 wolves and some unknown number of cougars on the first night.\n\n    Thus, \\( w_1 = 10 \\).\n\n2. **Total animals killed on the first night:**\n   - The total number of animals killed on the first night is given by:\n     \\[\n     T_1 = w_1 + c_1 = 10 + c_1\n     \\]\n\n3. **Variables for the second night:**  \n   - Let \\( w_2 \\) be the number of wolves killed on the second night.\n   - Let \\( c_2 \\) be the number of cougars killed on the second night.\n\n4. **Relationship between wolves and cougars on the second night:**\n   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars on the second night, thus:\n     \\[\n     w_2 = 3c_2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Relation between cougars killed over the two nights:**\n   - Rick killed three fewer cougars on the second night than the first night:\n     \\[\n     c_2 = c_1 - 3\n     \\]\n\n6. **Combine the equations:**\n   - Substitute \\( c_2 = c_1 - 3 \\) into the equation \\( w_2 = 3c_2 \\):\n     \\[\n     w_2 = 3(c_1 - 3) = 3c_1 - 9\n     \\]\n\n7. **Total kills on the second night:**\n   - The total number of animals killed on the second night is:\n     \\[\n     T_2 = w_2 + c_2 = (3c_1 - 9) + (c_1 - 3) = 4c_1 - 12\n     \\]\n\n8. **Sum of kills over both nights:**\n   - The sum of animals killed on both nights is:\n     \\[\n     T = T_1 + T_2 = (10 + c_1) + (4c_1 - 12) = 5c_1 - 2\n     \\]\n\nFrom here, a crucial observation can help: James killed 3 fewer cougars the second night than the first (which implies he killed at least 4 cougars the first night). Let's confirm the solution by assuming this value and checking consistency:\n\n- Let \\( c_1 = 4 \\) (since the next integer above zero less than needing 3 killed second night).\n- Then \\( c_2 = c_1 - 3 = 1 \\).\n- So wolves second night: \\( w_2 = 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total killed:\n   - First Night: \\(10 + 4 = 14\\)\n   - Second Night: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\)\n\n**Total animals killed over both nights: \\(14 + 4 = 18\\).**\n\nThus, Rick killed a total of 18 animals."
