In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

She does this three times:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 26 = 78 \\text{ letters}\n    \\]\n\n2. **Writing Half of the Alphabet Once**:  \n    Writing half of the alphabet means writing 13 letters:\n    \\[\n    13 \\text{ letters}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Total Written Before Re-writing**:  \n    Before re-writing, Elise has written a total of:\n    \\[\n    78 \\text{ letters (full alphabets)} + 13 \\text{ letters (half alphabet)} = 91 \\text{ letters}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Re-writing Everything She Has Already Written**:  \n    Elise re-writes the total number of letters she has written so far (91):\n    \\[\n    91 \\text{ letters}\n    \\]\n\n5. **Final Total of Letters Written**:  \n    To find out the final total number of letters written, add the initial letters and the re-written letters:\n    \\[\n    91 \\text{ letters (initial)} + 91 \\text{ letters (re-written)} = 182 \\text{ letters}\n    \\]\n\nThus, in total, Elise has written 182 letters."
