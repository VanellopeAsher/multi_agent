They both followed correct logical steps:\n\n1. Three women are wearing 4.5-inch heels.\n2. Three women are wearing 2.5-inch heels.\n3. The total height of 4.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5\\) inches.\n4. The total height of 2.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\) inches.\n5. The total height of all heels combined is \\(13.5 + 7.5 = 21\\) inches.\n6. The total number of women is 6.\n7. The average height of heels is \\(\\frac{21}{6} = 3.5\\) inches.\n\nTherefore, both approaches yielded the same result.
