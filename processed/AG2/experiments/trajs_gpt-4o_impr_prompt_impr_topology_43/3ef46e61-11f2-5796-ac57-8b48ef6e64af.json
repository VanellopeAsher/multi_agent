      "content": "To solve the problem of calculating the number of calls Tim deals with in his 5-day workweek, including an extended Friday, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Work Hours Per Day**:\n   - From Monday to Thursday, Tim works 6 hours each day.\n   - On Friday, he works an additional 2 hours, making it a total of 8 hours on that day.\n\n2. **Convert Work Hours to Minutes**:\n   - Tim works 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day from Monday to Thursday.\n   - On Friday, he works 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Calls Per Day**:\n   - Each call takes 15 minutes.\n   - Therefore, calls handled per day from Monday to Thursday = 360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls.\n   - Calls handled on Friday = 480 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 32 calls.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Calls in the Work Week**:\n   - From Monday to Thursday, Tim handles 24 calls/day * 4 days = 96 calls.\n   - On Friday, he handles 32 calls.\n   - Total calls in the work week = 96 calls + 32 calls = 128 calls.\n\nThus, Tim deals with a total of 128 calls during his 5-day work week when accounting for the extra hours on Friday."
