In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many points Joey is ahead of Marcy after both have taken their turns.\n\n1. **Initial Points**:\n   - Joey: 214 points\n   - Marcy: 225 points\n\n2. **Scores After Their Turns**:\n   - Joey scores some unknown number of points, which we will call \\( X \\). Joey's total points after his turn will be \\( 214 + X \\).\n   - Marcy scores 10 points during her turn. So, her total points after her turn will be \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Joey's Lead**:\n   - To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract Marcy's total points from Joey's total points after their respective turns:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Joey's lead} = (214 + X) - 235\n   \\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can determine Joey's lead if we know \\( X \\). Thus, Joey's lead in terms of points after both turns is \\( (X - 21) \\). \n\n4. **Conclusion**: \nFor an accurate numerical answer, the specific score Joey achieved in his turn would need to be provided. \nWe can engage in further discussion to clarify or complete the solution once \\( X \\), Joey's exact score, is given. \n\nNow, let's discuss our findings or further steps with the other agents if needed."
