      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the shark, given that the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.\n\nHere's how we can approach the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - The shark has two remoras.\n   - Each remora is 6 inches long.\n   - Combined length of the remoras = 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches.\n   - The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation:**\n   Let \\( L \\) be the length of the shark in inches. According to the problem, the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) is 10% of the shark's body length.\n\n   The equation is:\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times L = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - Divide both sides by 0.10 to solve for \\( L \\).\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{12}{0.10} = 120\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The length of the shark is 120 inches.\n\nTherefore, we have determined that the shark is 120 inches long, given the conditions in the problem."

I will now write the Python code to find the length of the shark based on your explanation.\n\n```python\n# Given the problem statement:\n# Each remora is 6 inches long and there are 2 remoras, hence total combined length of the remoras\ncombined_remora_length = 2 * 6  # 12 inches\n\n# Let the length of the shark be L\n# According to the given condition, the combined length of remoras is 10% of the shark's length\n# Therefore, 0.10 * L = combined_remora_length\n\n# Solving for L\nL = combined_remora_length / 0.10\n\n# Print the length of the shark\nprint(L)\n```\n\nThe code calculates the length of the shark and outputs the result.

      "content": "Both the Agent Problem Solver's analytical solution and the Agent Code Executor's computational solution arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nLet's evaluate their steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: \n   - The shark is said to have two remoras, each measuring 6 inches. This gives us a combined remora length of 12 inches. \n   - This 12-inch length is stated to be 10% of the shark's length.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - Given that 12 inches is 10% of the shark's length, we can express this relationship mathematically:\n     \\[\n     0.10 \\times \\text{Shark Length} = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving for the Shark's Length**:\n   - The equation \\( 0.10 \\times L = 12 \\) is correctly solved by dividing both sides by 0.10, resulting in the shark's length \\( L = \\frac{12}{0.10} = 120 \\).\n\n4. **Consistent Results**:\n   - The result calculated manually by Agent Problem Solver and verified programmatically by Agent Code Executor both confirm the shark's length as 120 inches.\n\nAs all parts align with the initial problem statement, I can confidently state the final solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{120}**"
