      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand Group Division**: There were 200 kids in total, divided into equal groups of girls and boys. Thus, there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n\n2. **Boys' Contribution**: Each boy brought back 600 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ boys} \\times 600 \\text{ shells/boy} = 60,000 \\text{ shells}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Girls' Contribution**: According to the problem, the girls brought back a total number of seashells equal to the number brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys gathered. Let's express this mathematically:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Girls' seashells} = \\text{Boys' seashells} + 4 \\times \\text{Boys' seashells}\n   \\]\n   Plug in the total seashells collected by the boys:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Girls' seashells} = 60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Seashells Brought by Each Girl**: Since there are 100 girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seashells per girl} = \\frac{300,000 \\text{ shells}}{100 \\text{ girls}} = 3,000 \\text{ shells/girl}\n   \\]\n\nConclusion: Each girl brought back 3,000 seashells."
