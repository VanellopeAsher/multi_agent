Thus, if 9 unicorns are in the Highlands, they represent \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the world population of unicorns.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Unicorn Population:**\n   - If 9 unicorns constitute one-third of the total unicorn population, then:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Unicorns in the World} = 9 \\times 3 = 27\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine Unicorns Outside of Scotland:**\n   - Finally, if there are 27 unicorns in the world and 9 are in Scotland, the number of unicorns outside Scotland (in the rest of the world) is:\n     \\[\n     27 - 9 = 18\n     \\]\n\nThus, there are 18 unicorns left in the world outside of Scotland."
