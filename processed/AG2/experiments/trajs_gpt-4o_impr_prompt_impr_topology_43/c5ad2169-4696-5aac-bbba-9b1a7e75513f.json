I'll break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Fish Tank**: Scarlett bought a fish tank for $10.00.\n\n2. **Packets of Stones**: She purchased two packets of stones, each costing $2.50.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of stones} = 2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00 \n   \\]\n\n3. **Coral Pieces**: She bought three coral pieces, each costing $2.00.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of coral pieces} = 3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00 \n   \\]\n\n4. **Fish**: She bought 20 fish, each priced at $0.50.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of fish} = 20 \\times 0.50 = 10.00 \n   \\]\n\n5. **Fish Food**: The cost of the fish food is $2.00.\n\nNow, adding all these expenses together gives us the total amount Scarlett spent:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Amount Spent} = 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00. \n\nLet's proceed to discuss and verify this calculation with the other agents."
