In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Were there any additional considerations or assumptions that should be addressed?"

The problem involves simply summing up the amounts of candy brought by each individual and then dividing it by the number of individuals to find out how much each person will receive after equal distribution.\n\nGiven that there are no complications or considerations like differences in candy types or preferences specified in the problem, your solution straightforwardly and effectively addresses the requirement.\n\nOnce Agent Code Executor verifies the calculations with Python code, we can make sure the numerical division result is accurate too. Would you like Agent Code Executor to perform this calculation as well?"
