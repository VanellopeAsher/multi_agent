      "content": "To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we first need to figure out the total time he spent on activities and then use that information to calculate the time spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Time Spent Boating**: John spent 6 hours boating.\n\n2. **Time Spent Swimming**: John spent half the time he spent boating swimming. Therefore, the time spent swimming is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent swimming} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time Spent Watching Shows**: John watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long. Therefore, the time spent watching shows is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent watching shows} = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Time Spent on Activities** (excluding sightseeing): \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 6 \\text{ (boating)} + 3 \\text{ (swimming)} + 6 \\text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **30% of Total Time**: The question states that the time spent watching shows (6 hours) was 30% of the total time spent on all activities. Let \\( x \\) be the total time spent on all activities.\n   \\[\n   0.30x = 6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Total Time \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Time Spent Sightseeing**: Now, knowing the total time (20 hours), we subtract the time spent on other activities (15 hours) to find the time spent sightseeing.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent sightseeing} = 20 - 15 = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John spent 5 hours sightseeing."
