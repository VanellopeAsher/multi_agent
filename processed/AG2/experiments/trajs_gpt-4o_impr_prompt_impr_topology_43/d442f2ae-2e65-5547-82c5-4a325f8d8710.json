In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money John spent at the market based on the items he purchased.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the goats**: \n   - John buys 3 goats, each costing $500.\n   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats × $500/goat = $1500\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the cows**: \n   - John buys 2 cows, each costing $1500.\n   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows × $1500/cow = $3000\n\n3. **Sum up the total expenditure**: \n   - Add the cost of the goats and the cows to find the total amount spent.\n   - Total expenditure = $1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500\n\nSince John decided not to buy the horse, we do not include its price in the total expenditure. Therefore, John spent a total of $4500 at the market."
