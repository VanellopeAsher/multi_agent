      "content": "To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy to hang around his backyard fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Length of the fence is 20.5 feet\n- Width of the fence is 15.5 feet\n\nLet's plug in these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (20.5 + 15.5) \\]\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times 36 \\]\n\n\\[ P = 72 \\]\n\nSo, James needs to buy 72 feet of crepe paper to go around his backyard fence. \n\nLet's discuss this solution to ensure accuracy and clarity."
