Jayden initially has $70 from selling pictures.\n2. Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45.\n3. Therefore, Jayden has a total of $70 + $45 = $115.\n4. Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera.\n5. Thus, the total cost of the camera is $115 + $85 = $200.\n\nBoth approaches correctly apply the given information and arithmetic, arriving at the same conclusion. I am confident that the camera's cost is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{200}**"
