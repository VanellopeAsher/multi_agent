      "content": "Certainly! Let's outline the step-by-step solution to find the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Oranges**: \n   - Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes.\n   - Each box contains 20 oranges.\n   - Total oranges = 12 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.\n\n2. **Deduct the Gifted Oranges**:\n   - Mrs. Harrington gifted her mother 2 boxes.\n   - Mrs. Harrington gifted her sibling 2 boxes.\n   - Oranges gifted = 4 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 80 oranges.\n   - Remaining oranges after gifting = 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges.\n\n3. **Determine the Oranges Retained by Mrs. Harrington**:\n   - Mrs. Harrington kept a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself.\n   - Oranges retained = (1/4) × 160 oranges = 40 oranges.\n\n4. **Calculate the Oranges Sold**:\n   - Remaining oranges after retaining = 160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges.\n   - Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.\n\nHence, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges. \n\nI'm ready to discuss this approach with the team and see if anyone has alternate calculations or suggestions."

Let's evaluate them step by step:\n\n1. **Total Number of Oranges**: Both agents correctly calculated that Mrs. Harrington initially had 240 oranges (12 boxes × 20 oranges per box).\n\n2. **Oranges Gifted**: Both agents accounted correctly for the oranges gifted to her mother and sibling, totaling 80 oranges (4 boxes × 20 oranges per box).\n\n3. **Remaining Oranges After Gifting**: Both solutions accurately determined that 160 oranges were left after gifting (240 - 80).\n\n4. **Oranges Retained**: Both concluded that Mrs. Harrington kept 40 oranges for herself (1/4 of 160).\n\n5. **Oranges Sold**: Finally, both solutions correctly calculated that she sold 120 oranges (160 - 40).\n\nThe result from Agent Code Executor's Python code execution also matches the manually calculated result from Agent Problem Solver.\n\nTherefore, the verified solution is that Mrs. Harrington sold:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{120}**"
