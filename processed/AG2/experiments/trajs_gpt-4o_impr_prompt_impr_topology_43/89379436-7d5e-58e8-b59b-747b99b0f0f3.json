Without the shark's actual length, this remains an expression rather than a numerical answer."

Here's a breakdown of what has been accomplished:\n\n1. **Agent Problem Solver**: Provided an expression \\(\\frac{12}{S} \\times 100\\%\\) to represent the remoras' length percentage of the shark's length in terms of an unknown shark length \\(S\\).\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor**: Suggested using a hypothetical shark body length of 72 inches to execute the calculation.\n\nSince the specific length of the shark is not given in the problem statement, it is critical to stick to the algebraic expression. Therefore, due to the lack of exact numerical shark body length, the solution remains an expression rather than a concrete numerical percentage.\n\n**Final Solution**: Given a shark body length \\(S\\), the remoras' combined length is\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{12}{S} \\times 100}\n\\]\npercent of the shark's body length. This approach accounts for the missing information by accurately expressing the percentage in terms of \\(S\\). If \\(S\\) were provided, this expression could produce a precise percentage value."
