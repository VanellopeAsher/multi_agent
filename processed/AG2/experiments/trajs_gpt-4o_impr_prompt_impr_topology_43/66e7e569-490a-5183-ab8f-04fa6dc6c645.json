      "content": "To solve this problem, I will use a straightforward proportional relationship method.\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Ratio**:  \n   We are given that 60 potatoes can make 360 hash browns. Therefore, 1 potato can make:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360 \\text{ hash browns}}{60 \\text{ potatoes}} = 6 \\text{ hash browns per potato}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the Ratio to Calculate for 960 Potatoes**:  \n   If 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, then 960 potatoes will make:\n   \\[\n   960 \\text{ potatoes} \\times 6 \\text{ hash browns per potato} = 5760 \\text{ hash browns}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, you can make 5760 hash browns out of 960 potatoes.\n\nLet's discuss if anyone sees a need to address anything differently."

Here’s how I’ll calculate the number of hash browns made from 960 potatoes:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of hash browns per potato** by dividing the number of hash browns made from 60 potatoes.\n2. **Multiply the number of hash browns per potato by 960 potatoes** to get the total number of hash browns.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of hash browns per potato\nhash_browns_per_potato = 360 / 60\n\n# Calculate the total number of hash browns for 960 potatoes\ntotal_hash_browns = hash_browns_per_potato * 960\n\nprint(total_hash_browns)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
