In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To calculate the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Days in 12 Weeks**:  \n   Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply the number of weeks (12) by the number of days per week (7).  \n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ weeks} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 84 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Eggs Used**:  \n   Claire uses 3 eggs every morning. So, multiply the number of days (84) by the number of eggs used per day (3).\n   \\[\n   84 \\text{ days} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/day} = 252 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Total Number of Eggs to Dozens**:  \n   Since a dozen equals 12 eggs, divide the total number of eggs (252) by 12 to find out how many dozens she will consume.\n   \\[\n   252 \\text{ eggs} \\div 12 \\text{ eggs/dozen} = 21 \\text{ dozens}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks."
