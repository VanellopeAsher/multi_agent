      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: \n   - John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes.\n   - A normal sudoku puzzle takes 30 minutes to complete.\n   - An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 3 times longer than a normal sudoku puzzle.\n\n2. **Calculate the Time Taken for an Extreme Sudoku**:\n   - Since a normal sudoku takes 30 minutes, an extreme sudoku takes 3 times as long.\n   - Time for extreme sudoku = \\(30 \\text{ minutes} \\times 3 = 90 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Bottles Drank**:\n   - John drinks a bottle every 30 minutes.\n   - In 90 minutes, we need to calculate how many 30-minute intervals there are:\n     - 90 minutes consists of three 30-minute intervals (\\(90 / 30 = 3\\)).\n   - Therefore, John drinks 3 bottles of water in 90 minutes.\n\n**Solution**:\nJohn drinks 3 bottles of water while completing an extreme sudoku.\n\nI will now discuss this approach with the team."
