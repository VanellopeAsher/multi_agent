In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Boys and Girls:**\n   - Since there are 20 kids and they are divided equally into two groups, there would be 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Seashells Brought by the Boys:**\n   - Each boy brings back 60 seashells.\n   - Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by all the boys is \\(10 \\times 60 = 600\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Total Number of Seashells Brought by the Girls:**\n   - We are told that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys.\n   - So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls can be calculated as \\(600 + 4.5 \\times 600\\).\n\n4. **Calculate That Total:**\n   - First, calculate \\(4.5 \\times 600\\):\n     - \\(4.5 \\times 600 = 2700\\).\n\n   - Now, add this to the total seashells the boys brought:\n     - Total for the girls = \\(600 + 2700 = 3300\\).\n\n5. **Determine How Many Seashells Were Brought by Each Girl:**\n   - There are 10 girls, so we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10.\n   - Each girl brought \\( \\frac{3300}{10} = 330 \\) seashells. \n\nConclusion: Each girl brought back 330 seashells."
