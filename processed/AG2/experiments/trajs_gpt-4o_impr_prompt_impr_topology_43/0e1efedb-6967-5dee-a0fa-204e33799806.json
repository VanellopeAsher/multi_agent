Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost Before the Discount:**\n   - Cost of the pots: $19\n   - Cost of the garden soil: $26\n   - Total cost before discount = Cost of pots + Cost of garden soil\n   - Total cost before discount = $19 + $26 = $45\n\n2. **Apply the Discount:**\n   - Discount amount: $7\n   - Total amount spent = Total cost before discount - Discount amount\n   - Total amount spent = $45 - $7 = $38\n\nTherefore, your mother expended a total of $38 at the gardening store."
