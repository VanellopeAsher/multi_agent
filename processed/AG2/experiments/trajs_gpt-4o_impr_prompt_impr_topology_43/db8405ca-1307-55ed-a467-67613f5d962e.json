Total cost for wooden tables:  \n   \\[ 40 \\times 200 = 8000 \\]\n\n2. Total cost for roof frames:  \n   \\[ 20 \\times 100 = 2000 \\]\n\n3. Total amount Ali has to pay John:  \n   \\[ 8000 + 2000 = 10000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John $10,000.\n\nLet me know if you need any further clarification!"
