We need the exact value of \\( H \\) to compute the final height in numerical terms. \n\nLet me know if you need any further exploration or another viewpoint on this."

As it wasn't specified in the problem, we could consider a potential scenario where Jane noted the height at the end of the first week or assume a reasonable estimate for demonstration purposes.

Without a given value for \\( H \\), the exact height cannot be calculated.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor** assumed an initial example height of 5 inches to demonstrate the calculation process, resulting in a height of 14 inches after 3 weeks based on the formula provided.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the initial height \\( H \\). According to the Solution Requirement, assumed values are not valid for a final solution. Without an explicitly specified initial height, we cannot conclusively determine the beanstalk's height after 3 weeks.\n\nTherefore, in adherence to the requirement of not making assumptions, the final solution given the available data should be:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
