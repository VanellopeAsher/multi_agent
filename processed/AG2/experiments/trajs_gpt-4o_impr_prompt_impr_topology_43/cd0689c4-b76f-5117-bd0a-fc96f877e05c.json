If any complexities or constraints (like different ribbon lengths for different types of presents) were introduced, the solution would require adjustment to accommodate those conditions."

To find out how much ribbon she can allocate for each present, we divide the total ribbon length by the total number of presents.\n\nHere's the calculation summarized in Python code:\n\n```python\n# Total number of presents\ntotal_presents = 6 + 4 + 2\n\n# Total length of ribbon available\ntotal_ribbon_length = 144\n\n# Calculate ribbon per present\nribbon_per_present = total_ribbon_length / total_presents\n\nprint(ribbon_per_present)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and print the length of ribbon that can be allocated for each present's bow.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
