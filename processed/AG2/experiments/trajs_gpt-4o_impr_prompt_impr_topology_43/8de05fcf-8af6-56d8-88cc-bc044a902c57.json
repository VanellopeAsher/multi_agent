      "content": "To solve Meredith's article writing problem, let's proceed through the steps systematically:\n\n1. **Determine Articles Written on Tuesday:**\n   - Monday: Meredith wrote 5 articles.\n   - On Tuesday, she wrote \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more articles than on Monday.\n   - Therefore, on Tuesday, she wrote:  \n     \\[\n     5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ articles}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Hours Spent on Articles on Monday and Tuesday:**\n   - Time per article = 4 hours.\n   - Time spent on Monday = \\(5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ hours}\\).\n   - Time spent on Tuesday = \\(7 \\times 4 = 28 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n3. **Determine Hours Spent on Wednesday:**\n   - Total hours spent over three days = 104 hours.\n   - Hours spent on Monday and Tuesday = \\(20 + 28 = 48 \\text{ hours}\\).\n   - Hours spent on Wednesday = \\(104 - 48 = 56 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate Articles Written on Wednesday:**\n   - Articles written on Wednesday = \\(\\frac{56}{4} = 14\\).\n\n5. **Determine the Ratio of Articles Written on Wednesday to Tuesday:**\n   - Articles on Wednesday = 14.\n   - Articles on Tuesday = 7.\n   - Ratio of Wednesday's articles to Tuesday's articles = \\(\\frac{14}{7} = 2\\).\n\nThus, Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday."
