      "content": "To determine how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we need to calculate the area of fabric required for both the comforter and the duvet cover separately, and then sum these areas.\n\n1. **Determine the size of the fabric needed for the comforter:**\n\n   - The bed's dimensions are 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.\n   - Jim wants the comforter to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed on each side. Therefore, we add 4 feet to both dimensions (2 feet for each side).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of comforter} = 6 + 4 = 10 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Width of comforter} = 8 + 4 = 12 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   \n   - Thus, the area for one piece of the comforter is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one piece of fabric for comforter} = 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n   \n   - Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric for the comforter, the total area needed for the comforter is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area for comforter} = 2 \\times 120 = 240 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the size of the fabric needed for the duvet cover:**\n\n   - The required dimensions for the duvet cover are 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of duvet cover} = 9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total fabric needed:**\n\n   - Add the total fabric needed for both the comforter and the duvet cover.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fabric needed} = 240 + 99 = 339 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy **339 square feet** of fabric in total. \n\nLet's discuss if there are other considerations or possible errors in this calculation."
