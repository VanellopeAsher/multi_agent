  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

      "content": "To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to break down the problem and calculate the total time he spent on activities first. Once we have the total time, we can use the fact that he spent 40% of this time sightseeing to find the answer.\n\n1. **Calculate the time for each activity:**\n\n   - Boating: 6 hours.\n   - Swimming: He spent half of the boating time swimming, so \\(6 \\text{ hours}/2 = 3 \\text{ hours}\\).\n   - Watching shows: He watched 3 shows and each was 2 hours, so \\(3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n2. **Sum the times of the activities to find the total activities time:**\n\n   - Total time spent on activities = Time boating + Time swimming + Time watching shows\n   - Total time spent on activities = \\(6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\text{ hours}\\)\n  \n   According to the problem statement, this total of 15 hours represents 30% of the total time spent, including sightseeing.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time including sightseeing:**\n\n   Since 15 hours accounts for 30% of the total time spent, we can use the following formula to find the total time, \\( X \\):\n\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times X = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{15}{0.30}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   X = 50 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n\n   Since sightseeing accounted for 40% of the total time:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \\times X = 0.40 \\times 50 = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nSo, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
