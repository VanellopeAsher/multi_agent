People who couldn't come:\n   - 16 people were ill.\n   - 1/4 of 16 equals 4 people with previous commitments, making the total not attending due to either reason = 16 + 4 = 20.\n\n4. People attending = 132 initially invited - 20 not attending = 112.\n\nThis confirms that the correct number of people who show up for Martha's party is 112.
