      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother and then calculate the sum of those ages. Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:\n   - Let Emil's current age be \\( E = 21 \\) years.\n   - Let Emil's dad's current age be \\( D \\).\n   - Let Emil's brother's current age be \\( B \\).\n\n2. **Age Relations when Emil turns 26**:\n   - Emil will turn 26 in 5 years (\\(21 + 5 = 26\\)).\n   - When Emil is 26, his dad will be \\( D + 5 \\).\n   - When Emil is 26, his brother will be \\( B + 5 \\).\n   \n   The problem states:\n   - Emil will be half his dad's age. Thus, \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \\).\n   - Emil will be twice his brother's age. Thus, \\( 26 = 2(B + 5) \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Equations**:\n\n   From the first equation \\(26 = \\frac{1}{2} (D + 5)\\),\n   \\[\n   52 = D + 5 \\implies D = 47\n   \\]\n\n   From the second equation \\(26 = 2(B + 5)\\),\n   \\[\n   26 = 2B + 10 \\implies 16 = 2B \\implies B = 8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum of Ages of Dad and Brother Now**:\n   - Emil's dad is 47 years old.\n   - Emil's brother is 8 years old.\n\n   Therefore, the sum of their ages now is \\( 47 + 8 = 55 \\).\n\nThus, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 55 years."
