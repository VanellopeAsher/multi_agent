In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Here's the plan:\n\n- Calculate the total cost for notebooks.\n- Calculate the total cost for ballpens.\n- Sum the two costs to get the total expenditure.\n\nLet's execute the code:\n\n```python\n# Prices\nnotebook_price = 15\nballpen_price = 5\n\n# Quantities purchased\nnotebooks_purchased = 50\nballpens_purchased = 10\n\n# Cost calculations\ntotal_cost_notebooks = notebooks_purchased * notebook_price\ntotal_cost_ballpens = ballpens_purchased * ballpen_price\n\n# Total expenditure\ntotal_expenditure = total_cost_notebooks + total_cost_ballpens\ntotal_expenditure\n```\n\nThe result from executing the code is 800.
