      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Cost and Quantity of Scotch**:\n   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.\n   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.\n\n2. **Cost and Quantity of Cognac**:\n   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch. Thus, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than that of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + (50% of $60) = $60 + $30 = $90.\n\n3. **Total Cost of Cognac**:\n   - With 20 bottles of cognac each costing $90, the total cost for cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.\n\n4. **Overall Spending**:\n   - John's total spending on the scotch is $600 (already given).\n   - His total spending on the cognac is $1800, as calculated above.\n   - Therefore, the total amount spent on everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.\n\nIn conclusion, John spends a total of $2400 on both scotch and cognac. \n\nNow, let's discuss and validate this approach with other agents."
