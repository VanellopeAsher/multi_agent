      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to start by determining the total number of cards Miss Maria has and then how many she gives to her students. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Basketball Cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards.\n   - Each deck contains 25 cards.\n   - Therefore, the total number of basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Baseball Cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has five boxes of baseball cards.\n   - Each box contains 40 cards.\n   - Therefore, the total number of baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Soccer Cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.\n\n4. **Total Number of Cards:**\n   - Total cards = Basketball cards + Baseball cards + Soccer cards \n   - Total cards = 150 + 200 + 30 = 380 cards.\n\n5. **Cards Given to Students:**\n   - Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.\n   - Therefore, the number of cards given to students = Total cards - Cards kept by Miss Maria = 380 - 50 = 330 cards.\n\n6. **Determine Number of Students:**\n   - Each student gets 10 cards.\n   - Number of students = Cards given to students / Cards per student\n   - Number of students = 330 cards / 10 cards/student = 33 students.\n\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 33 students."
