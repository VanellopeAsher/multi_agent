In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

By dividing the remaining paint equally among the three colors after allocating the yellow, you reached the correct conclusion that 2 pints of red paint were used. \n\nSince Agent Problem Solver has provided a well-reasoned solution, I will now proceed with verifying this through code execution.
