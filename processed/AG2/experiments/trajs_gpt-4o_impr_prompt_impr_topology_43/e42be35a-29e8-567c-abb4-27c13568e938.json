At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.

The calculations in both approaches are consistent, and no assumptions were made regarding undefined variables. Here is the reasoning:\n- Greta made 12 brownies.\n- She received 6 brownies from her office.\n- Her friends provided 48 brownies (4 dozen).\n- A total of 18 brownies were eaten during the party.\n\nTherefore, the leftover brownies are calculated as:\n\n\\[ \n66 \\text{ (total received)} - 18 \\text{ (eaten)} = 48 \n\\]\n\nBoth approaches are correctly aligned with the problem statement. Therefore, the final number of individual brownies Greta had leftover from the entire day is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{48}**"
