      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll determine the number of each type of TV sold based on the given fractions of the total sales and then find out how many OLED TVs were sold.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of smart TVs sold**:\n   - The problem states that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.\n   - Total number of TVs sold = 40\n   - Number of smart TVs = (1/4) * 40 = 10\n\n2. **Calculate the number of analog TVs sold**:\n   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.\n   - Number of analog TVs = (1/8) * 40 = 5\n\n3. **Calculate the number of projection TVs sold**:\n   - One-fifth of the sales are projection TVs.\n   - Number of projection TVs = (1/5) * 40 = 8\n\n4. **Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold**:\n   - Since the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs, we subtract the sum of the other types from the total number:\n   - Number of OLED TVs = Total sales - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs + Number of projection TVs)\n   - Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5 + 8) = 40 - 23 = 17\n\nTherefore, Samwell sold 17 OLED TVs. \n\nLet's discuss the solution and see if any adjustments are needed or if there are other approaches."
