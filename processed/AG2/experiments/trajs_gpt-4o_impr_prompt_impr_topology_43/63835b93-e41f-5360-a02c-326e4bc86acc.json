In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Neutering Cost:**  \n   - The cost of neutering the kitten is \\( \\$150 \\).\n\n2. **Vaccination Cost:**  \n   - Each vaccine costs \\( \\$30 \\), and there are 2 vaccines. \n   - Therefore, the total cost for vaccines is \\( 2 \\times \\$30 = \\$60 \\).\n\n3. **Cost of Broken Vases:**  \n   - Each broken vase costs \\( \\$15 \\), and the kitten broke 3 vases.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the broken vases is \\( 3 \\times \\$15 = \\$45 \\).\n\n4. **Total Cost Calculation:**  \n   - Add up all the individual costs: \n   - Total Cost = Neutering Cost + Vaccination Cost + Cost of Broken Vases\n   - Total Cost = \\( \\$150 + \\$60 + \\$45 \\)\n\nLet's calculate the final total:\n\n\\[ Total\\, Cost = 150 + 60 + 45 = 255 \\]\n\nThus, the total cost Leah has incurred for her kitten so far is \\( \\$255 \\)."
