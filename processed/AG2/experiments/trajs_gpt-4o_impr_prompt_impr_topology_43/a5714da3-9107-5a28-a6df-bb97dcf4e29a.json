We are unable to calculate this since the number of fish (20) is mentioned, but the unit price is missing.\n\n5. **Cost of the Fish Food**: Scarlett also bought fish food for $2.00.\n\nNext, we add up all the costs to find the total expenses. However, due to the missing cost of the fish, we can only calculate the known expenses:\n\nTotal known expenses = Cost of the Aquarium + Cost of the Rocks + Cost of the Coral + Cost of the Fish Food  \n\\[ \n10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = 23.00 \n\\]\n\nTherefore, based on the given information (excluding the unknown cost of the fish), Scarlett spent $23.00.\n\nIn order to provide the complete amount spent, we either need the price per fish or another clarification on the pricing for the fish."

Given this:\n\nLet's assume the cost per fish to be a variable, say `c`. Then, the cost for 20 fish would be \\(20 \\times c\\). The overall expenditure can be calculated accordingly. Should I proceed with formulating this into a Python expression for computation or you want me to assume a specific cost per fish? Once decided, I can write the code to calculate the result.

Let me write the corresponding Python code to reflect this.\n\n```python\n# Assign known costs to variables\ncost_aquarium = 10.00\ncost_rocks = 2 * 2.50\ncost_coral = 3 * 2.00\ncost_fish_food = 2.00\n\n# Assign variable for the cost of each fish, let's say `c` is the cost per fish\nc = 1.00  # this is an assumption, change as per actual cost\n\n# Calculate total cost involving the unknown fish cost\ntotal_cost = cost_aquarium + cost_rocks + cost_coral + (20 * c) + cost_fish_food\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Total cost with assumed fish cost $1.00 each:\", total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code assumes each fish costs $1.00 and calculates the total expenditure accordingly, but this should be adjusted once the actual cost per fish is known. With the assumed price, you can adjust the value of `c` to see different possible outcomes. Shall I execute this with the assumption, or would you like to suggest a different assumed price?

Since the problem lacks information on the cost per fish, computing the exact total amount Scarlett spent is not feasible based on the given data:\n\n- Known Expenses:\n  - Aquarium: $10.00\n  - Rocks: $5.00 (2 bags at $2.50 each)\n  - Coral: $6.00 (3 pieces at $2.00 each)\n  - Fish Food: $2.00\n\n- Missing Information:\n  - Cost per fish for 20 fish: Unknown\n\nThus, the total known expenses amount to $23.00, excluding the cost of the fish.
