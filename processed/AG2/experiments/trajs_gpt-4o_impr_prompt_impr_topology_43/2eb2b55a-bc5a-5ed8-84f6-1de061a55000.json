Therefore, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 59 = 78\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 78 - 59 = 19\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, they had 19 bandages at the beginning of the first day. \n\nPlease review and consider this solution, and if further discussion or verification is required, I am open to engagement."
