  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "Let's solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the problem:**\n\n   - The mechanic charges $60 per truck tire and $40 per car tire.\n   - On Thursday, 6 truck tires and 4 car tires are repaired.\n   - On Friday, only car tires are repaired.\n   - The mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n\n2. **Calculate Thursday's earnings:**\n\n   - Earnings from truck tires on Thursday = 6 truck tires * $60 per truck tire = $360\n   - Earnings from car tires on Thursday = 4 car tires * $40 per car tire = $160\n   - Total earnings on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520\n\n3. **Set up the equation for Friday:**\n\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n   - Earnings from car tires on Friday = \\( x \\) car tires * $40 per car tire = $40x\n   - The difference in earnings between Thursday and Friday = $40\n   - Thus, Thursday's earnings are $40 more than Friday's earnings: \\( 520 = 40x + 40 \\)\n\n4. **Solve the equation for \\( x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   520 = 40x + 40 \\\\\n   520 - 40 = 40x \\\\\n   480 = 40x \\\\\n   x = \\frac{480}{40} \\\\\n   x = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday."
