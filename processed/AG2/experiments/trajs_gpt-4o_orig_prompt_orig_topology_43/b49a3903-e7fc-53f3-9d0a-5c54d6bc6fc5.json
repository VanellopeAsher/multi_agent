You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant given his constraints. This can be solved by directly applying the constraints to determine the exact number of rows needed for each type of tulip and how the yellow rows are interspersed.\n\nThe approach is:\n- Calculate the number of rows needed for red tulips.\n- Calculate the number of rows needed for blue tulips.\n- Determine how many yellow rows are needed, given they are placed between each complete set of red and blue tulip rows.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n1. Calculate the number of rows for red tulips using the formula: \\(\\text{Number of red rows} = \\lceil \\text{Total red tulips} / \\text{Tulips per red row} \\rceil\\).\n2. Do the same for blue tulips.\n3. Use the rows calculated above to determine where yellow tulips can be placed.\n\nLet's go ahead and write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom math import ceil\n\n# Constants\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\nyellow_tulips = 30\nred_per_row = 6\nblue_per_row = 8\nyellow_per_row = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of rows\nred_rows = ceil(red_tulips / red_per_row)\nblue_rows = ceil(blue_tulips / blue_per_row)\ntotal_tulip_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\n# Calculate the maximum number of yellow rows that can fit between tulip rows\nyellow_rows = ceil(yellow_tulips / yellow_per_row)\n\n# Yellow rows are placed between every pair of tulip rows\n# So there are red_rows + blue_rows - 1 possible positions for yellow rows\nactual_yellow_rows = min(yellow_rows, total_tulip_rows - 1)\n\n# Total rows of flowers\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + actual_yellow_rows\n\nprint(\"Total rows of flowers:\", total_rows)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate the number of rows required for each color and the total number of yellow rows that can practically be used, culminating in the total number of rows planted. The answer will be shown using a `print` statement."
