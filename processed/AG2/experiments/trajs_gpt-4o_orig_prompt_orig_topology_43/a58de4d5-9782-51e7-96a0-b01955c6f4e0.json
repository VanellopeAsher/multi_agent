  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

We'll calculate the cost of each ingredient per jar, sum them up for one jar, determine the selling price for 10 jars, and subtract the total cost of ingredients for 10 jars from the total revenue.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar:\n   - Cost of passion fruit: \\(2 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$6/\\text{pound}\\)\n   - Cost of jackfruit: \\(1.5 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$8/\\text{pound}\\)\n   - Cost of honey: \\(2 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$10/\\text{pound}\\)\n\n2. Sum up the total cost for one jar.\n\n3. Calculate the selling price for 10 jars.\n\n4. Compute the total cost of ingredients for 10 jars.\n\n5. Compute the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Cost per pound of each ingredient\npassion_fruit_cost_per_pound = 6  # dollars\njackfruit_cost_per_pound = 8      # dollars\nhoney_cost_per_pound = 10         # dollars\n\n# Amount needed for one jar\namount_of_passion_fruit = 2       # pounds\namount_of_jackfruit = 1.5         # pounds\namount_of_honey = 2               # pounds\n\n# Calculate cost for one jar\ncost_of_passion_fruit = amount_of_passion_fruit * passion_fruit_cost_per_pound\ncost_of_jackfruit = amount_of_jackfruit * jackfruit_cost_per_pound\ncost_of_honey = amount_of_honey * honey_cost_per_pound\n\n# Total cost for one jar\ntotal_cost_per_jar = cost_of_passion_fruit + cost_of_jackfruit + cost_of_honey\n\n# Selling price per jar\nselling_price_per_jar = 50  # dollars\n\n# Number of jars sold\nnum_of_jars_sold = 10\n\n# Total revenue from selling 10 jars\ntotal_revenue = num_of_jars_sold * selling_price_per_jar\n\n# Total cost for 10 jars\ntotal_cost_for_10_jars = num_of_jars_sold * total_cost_per_jar\n\n# Profit calculation\nprofit = total_revenue - total_cost_for_10_jars\n\nprint(f\"Profit from selling 10 jars: ${profit}\")\n```\n\nThis program will output the profit Tim makes after selling 10 jars of his special mixture."
