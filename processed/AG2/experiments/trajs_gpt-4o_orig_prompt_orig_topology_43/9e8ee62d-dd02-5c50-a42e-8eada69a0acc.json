You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the growth pattern of the beanstalk over the three weeks and determine how much it grew during the third week. \n\nKey idea:\n- We know the beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week.\n- In the second week, it doubled in height from the first week.\n- In the third week, it grew an additional number of inches, and after the three weeks, its total height was 10 inches.\n\nLet's use this information to solve the problem.\n\n# Establish the height at the end of each week:\n1. After the first week: 3 inches.\n2. After the second week: \\(2 \\times 3\\) inches.\n3. After the third week: height in the second week plus the additional inches grown in the third week.\n\nWe can set up an equation to solve for the number of inches it grew in the third week.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of inches it grew in the third week. Then:\n- After the second week, the beanstalk was \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) inches tall.\n- After the third week, the beanstalk was \\( 6 + x = 10 \\) inches tall.\n\nLet's solve for \\( x \\).\n\n\\[\n6 + x = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nx = 10 - 6\n\\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for growth in the third week\nx = Symbol('x')\n\n# Equation representing growth in third week\nequation = Eq(6 + x, 10)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\nRun this code to find the solution."
