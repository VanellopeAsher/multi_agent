You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJenna shares her living space with four other people.

This is a straightforward calculation where we need to divide the monthly cost by the number of people and then multiply the result by 12 months to find the annual cost per person.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```python\n# import sympy to represent fractions as is, but here it's fairly straightforward\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the monthly cost of electricity and the number of people sharing the cost\nmonthly_cost = 100\nnum_people = 5\n\n# Calculate the monthly cost per person\nmonthly_cost_per_person = Rational(monthly_cost, num_people)\n\n# Calculate the annual contribution per person\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_cost_per_person * 12\n\n# Use the print function to display the output\nprint(annual_contribution_per_person)\n```\n\nThis code will give the annual contribution for each roommate in fraction form by making use of the `Rational` class from the `sympy` package. If run, this program should output `240` since the annual contribution in this case is simply $20 per month per person times 12 months."
