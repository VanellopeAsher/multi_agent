You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarly wants to treat her friends.

We'll break it down as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the hamburgers.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the potato fries.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the fruit drinks.\n4. Sum these costs to find the total amount spent.\n5. Subtract the total amount spent from fifty dollars to find the change.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this.\n\n```python\n# Using sympy for rational arithmetic\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices and quantities\nhamburger_price = Rational(4)  # $4 each\nhamburger_quantity = 5\n\nfries_price = Rational(30, 100)  # $0.30 each, represented as a fraction\nfries_quantity = 10\n\n# We need to find the price of one can of fruit drink\namount_given = Rational(50)  # $50\n\n# To find the total cost\ntotal_cost_hamburgers = hamburger_price * hamburger_quantity\ntotal_cost_fries = fries_price * fries_quantity\n\n# Subtracting the cost of hamburgers and fries from the total amount given\ntotal_change = amount_given - (total_cost_hamburgers + total_cost_fries)\n\ntotal_cost_fruit_drinks = amount_given - (total_cost_hamburgers + total_cost_fries) - total_change\n\n# Calculating the total cost\ntotal_cost = total_cost_hamburgers + total_cost_fries + total_cost_fruit_drinks\n\n# Change is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the amount given\nchange = amount_given - total_cost\n\n# Output the change\nprint(\"Change: $\", change)\n```\n\nOnce you run this Python program, it will calculate and print the change Carly receives after the purchase."
