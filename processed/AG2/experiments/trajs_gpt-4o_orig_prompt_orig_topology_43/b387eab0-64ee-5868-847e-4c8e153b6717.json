If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, and they have a coupon that offers a 10% discount on the total price after cashback, how much will they pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.

      "content": "To solve the given problem, we'll take the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial cost of the gas.**\n   \n   Since the price of gas is $3.00 per gallon and the person is buying 10 gallons, the initial cost is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial Cost} = 3.00 \\times 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cashback amount.**\n\n   The cashback is $0.20 per gallon for 10 gallons:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cashback} = 0.20 \\times 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost after cashback.**\n\n   Subtract the cashback from the initial cost to get the price after cashback:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost after Cashback} = \\text{Initial Cost} - \\text{Cashback}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the coupon discount.**\n\n   The coupon provides a 10% discount on the total price after cashback. To calculate the final price:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Cost} = \\text{Cost after Cashback} \\times (1 - 0.10)\n   \\]\n\nNow let's calculate everything using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Initial cost\nprice_per_gallon = 3\ngallons = 10\ninitial_cost = price_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Step 2: Cashback\ncashback_per_gallon = Rational('0.20')\ncashback_total = cashback_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Step 3: Cost after cashback\ncost_after_cashback = initial_cost - cashback_total\n\n# Step 4: Apply 10% discount\ncoupon_discount = Rational('0.10')\nfinal_cost = cost_after_cashback * (1 - coupon_discount)\n\n# Output the final result\nprint(final_cost)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the final amount the person will pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon."
