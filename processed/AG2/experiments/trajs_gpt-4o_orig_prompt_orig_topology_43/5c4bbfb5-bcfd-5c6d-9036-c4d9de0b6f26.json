  "problem": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

      "content": "To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract this from her overall budget of $65.\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n1. **Calculate the price of a single pack of bacon**: Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total, we can find the price for one pack.\n2. **Calculate the price and total cost of chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so we can find the total cost for chicken.\n3. **Calculate the total cost for strawberries**: She has 3 packs, and each costs $4.5.\n4. **Calculate the price and total cost of apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, and she has 7 packs.\n5. **Sum up the total cost**: Add all these costs together.\n6. **Calculate remaining budget**: Subtract the total cost from her $65 budget.\n7. **Output the result in dollar form.**\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate cost of one pack of bacon\ntotal_bacon_cost = Rational('10.5')\npacks_of_bacon = 5\ncost_per_bacon = total_bacon_cost / packs_of_bacon\n\n# Calculate cost for chicken\ncost_per_chicken = 2 * cost_per_bacon\npacks_of_chicken = 6\ntotal_chicken_cost = cost_per_chicken * packs_of_chicken\n\n# Calculate cost for strawberries\ncost_per_strawberry = Rational('4.5')\npacks_of_strawberries = 3\ntotal_strawberry_cost = cost_per_strawberry * packs_of_strawberries\n\n# Calculate cost for apples\ncost_per_apple = cost_per_strawberry / 2\npacks_of_apples = 7\ntotal_apple_cost = cost_per_apple * packs_of_apples\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = total_bacon_cost + total_chicken_cost + total_strawberry_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# Calculate remaining budget\nbudget = Rational('65')\nremaining_budget = budget - total_cost\n\n# Print the remaining budget using fractions\nprint(remaining_budget)\n```\n\nBy running this code, you'll find how much money Kelly has left in her budget in fraction form."
