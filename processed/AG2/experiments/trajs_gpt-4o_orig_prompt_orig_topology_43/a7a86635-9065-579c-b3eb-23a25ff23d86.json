In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 600 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the Situation:**\n   - Total number of kids = 200.\n   - The kids are divided equally into boys and girls, so there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n\n2. **Boys' Contribution:**\n   - Each boy brings back 600 shells.\n   - Total shells brought by all boys = 100 boys * 600 shells/boy = 60,000 shells.\n\n3. **Girls' Contribution:**\n   - According to the problem, the girls collectively bring back an amount equal to what the boys brought, plus four times the number of seashells the boys collected.\n   - This means the total shells brought by the girls = shells brought by the boys + 4 * shells brought by the boys.\n   - So, total shells brought by girls = 60,000 + 4 * 60,000 = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000 shells.\n\n4. **Shells Brought by Each Girl:**\n   - There are 100 girls, and together they bring back 300,000 shells.\n   - Shells brought by each girl = Total shells brought by all girls / Number of girls = 300,000 / 100.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python. Based on the steps outlined, the problem can be solved with direct computation, so it fits into Case 1.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total shells brought by girls\ntotal_girls_shells = 300000\n\n# Number of girls\nnumber_of_girls = 100\n\n# Shells brought by each girl\nshells_per_girl = Rational(total_girls_shells, number_of_girls)\n\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will give us the number of shells each girl brought back in a fraction form, ensuring any simplification is handled."
