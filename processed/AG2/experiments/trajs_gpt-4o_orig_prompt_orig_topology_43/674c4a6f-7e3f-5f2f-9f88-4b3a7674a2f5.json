You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

This can be directly solved using Python by computing the average of the given numbers.\n\nKey Idea: Case 1 applies here as the problem is a direct calculation of the average test scores.\n\nWe will write a simple Python program to determine the average:\n\n```python\n# Given test scores\nscores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate the average\naverage = sum(scores) / len(scores)\n\n# Print the average using fractions/radical form, if applicable\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Rational will display the result as a fraction if it's not a whole number\nprint(\"Math grade:\", Rational(average))\n```\n\nLet's compute the result to find out Wilson's math grade."

Let's recalculate the average to ensure we have the correct result.\n\nI will solve it step by step without Python's aid to ensure clarity:\n\nThe average of Wilson's scores can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{70 + 95 + 88 + 90 + 78}{5}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{421}{5} = 84.2\n\\]\n\nNow, let's encode this using a more appropriate method in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given test scores\nscores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate the average\naverage = sum(scores) / len(scores)\n\n# Print the average using sympy Rational for fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Simplify and print result\nprint(\"Math grade:\", Rational(average).limit_denominator())\n```\n\nLet's use the simpler ratio to display the result. In such cases where exact fractions are given between integers, a fraction limit may still provide an impractical output, but the precise value here is straightforward.
