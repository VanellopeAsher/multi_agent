You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

Let's define the number of cards each person has as follows:\n\n- Let \\( S \\) be the number of cards Smendrick has.\n- Let \\( P \\) be the number of cards PJ has.\n- Becca has \\( B \\) cards.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following relationships:\n\n1. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick: \n   \\[ B = S + 15 \\]\n\n2. Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards PJ has: \n   \\[ S = 4P \\]\n\n3. The total number of cards is 447: \n   \\[ B + S + P = 447 \\]\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using Python and sympy. Let's implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nB, S, P = symbols('B S P')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(B, S + 15)\neq2 = Eq(S, 4 * P)\neq3 = Eq(B + S + P, 447)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (B, S, P))\n\n# Print the number of cards Becca has\nprint(solution[B])\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the number of cards Becca has."
