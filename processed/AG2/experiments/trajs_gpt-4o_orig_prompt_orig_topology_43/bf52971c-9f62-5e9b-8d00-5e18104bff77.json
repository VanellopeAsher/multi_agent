You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Calculate the total amount of money from the $10 bills.\n2. Calculate the total amount of money from the $20 bills.\n3. Add these amounts together to get the total initial amount of money Ali has.\n4. Ali gives half of this total money to his sister.\n5. Use the remaining half to calculate how much Ali spends on dinner.\n6. Calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner.\n\nLet's write Python code to calculate these values:\n\n```python\n# Use sympy to utilize fractions for output\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Ali's money in terms of $10 and $20 bills\nnum_ten_dollars = 4\nnum_twenty_dollars = 6\n\n# Calculate total amount\ntotal_money = num_ten_dollars * 10 + num_twenty_dollars * 20\n\n# Ali gives half to his sister\nali_sister_share = Rational(total_money, 2)\n\n# Remaining money Ali keeps\nali_remaining = Rational(total_money, 2)\n\n# Ali buys dinner with 3/5 of his remaining money\nali_dinner_expense = Rational(3, 5) * ali_remaining\n\n# Money Ali has after buying dinner\nali_after_dinner = ali_remaining - ali_dinner_expense\n\n# Output the result\nprint(ali_after_dinner)\n```\n\nThe code calculates the total initial amount of money Ali has, divides it among Ali and his sister, computes the dinner expenses, and finally provides the money Ali is left with. The expected output should be in terms of exact fractions rather than decimals."

Let's continue with the calculation based on the result provided.\n\nAfter executing the code, we found that Ali has $32 after buying dinner.\n\nTo explain the result in context:\n\n1. Ali initially has a total of $160, calculated as:\n   - $40 from four $10 bills (4 * 10)\n   - $120 from six $20 bills (6 * 20)\n   - Total = $40 + $120 = $160\n\n2. Ali gives half of the $160 to his sister, which amounts to $80. This leaves Ali with $80.\n\n3. Ali spends \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of his remaining $80 on dinner:\n   - \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = 48 \\)\n\n4. Therefore, the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is $80 (remaining) - $48 (dinner expense) = $32.\n\nHence, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]\n\nAli has $32 left after buying dinner."
