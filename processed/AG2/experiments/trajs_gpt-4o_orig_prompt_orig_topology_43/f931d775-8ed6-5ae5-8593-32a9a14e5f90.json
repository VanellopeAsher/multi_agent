  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of lines Sean must memorize for both scenes and the solo song. Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Solo song:** Sean has 54 lines to memorize in the solo song.\n\n2. **First scene:**\n   - The total number of lines in the first scene is twice the number of lines in the solo song.\n   - Therefore, the first scene has \\( 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\) lines.\n   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, meaning \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36 \\) lines.\n\n3. **Second scene:**\n   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, which is \\( 54 + 6 = 60 \\) lines.\n   - Sean needs to memorize four-fifths of these lines, which is \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48 \\) lines.\n   - Due to the absence of another actor, Sean has to memorize an additional 15 lines in the second scene.\n\nTherefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize includes:\n- Lines from the solo song\n- His lines from the first scene\n- His lines from the second scene, including the additional lines due to the absent actor\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Lines from the solo song\nsolo_song_lines = 54\n\n# First scene calculation\ntotal_first_scene_lines = 2 * solo_song_lines\nsean_first_scene_lines = Rational(1, 3) * total_first_scene_lines\n\n# Second scene calculation\ntotal_second_scene_lines = solo_song_lines + 6\nsean_second_scene_lines = Rational(4, 5) * total_second_scene_lines\n\n# Additional lines due to absent actor\nadditional_lines = 15\n\n# Total lines Sean must memorize\ntotal_lines = solo_song_lines + sean_first_scene_lines + sean_second_scene_lines + additional_lines\n\n# Using print to display the result in the required format\nprint(total_lines)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total number of lines Sean has to memorize."
