You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.\n2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off (20% of the total days).\n3. Calculate the number of working days.\n4. Calculate how many people Billy can help per working day.\n5. Multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of working days to get the total number of people he helps.\n\nNow, we'll implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, ceiling\n\n# Total days in March\ndays_in_march = 31\n\n# Total days from April 1 to April 19\ndays_in_april = 19\n\n# Total days from March 1 to April 19\ntotal_days = days_in_march + days_in_april\n\n# Calculate the days he takes off\ndays_off_percentage = Rational(20, 100)\ndays_off = ceiling(days_off_percentage * total_days)  # Use ceiling to ensure whole days\n\n# Calculate the number of working days\nworking_days = total_days - days_off\n\n# Calculate the number of people Billy helps per day\npeople_per_hour = 2\nhours_per_day = 3.5\npeople_per_day = people_per_hour * hours_per_day\n\n# Calculate total number of people helped\ntotal_people_helped = working_days * people_per_day\n\nprint(\"Total people helped:\", total_people_helped)\n```\n\nRun this code to find out the total number of people Billy can help."
