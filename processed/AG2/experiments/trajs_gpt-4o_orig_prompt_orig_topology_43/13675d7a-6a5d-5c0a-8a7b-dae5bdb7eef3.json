You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

Calculate the total number of wheels required to assemble all the toys.\n   - For the cars: 57 cars × 4 wheels per car\n   - For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles × 2 wheels per motorcycle\n\n2. Sum the wheels used for both the cars and motorcycles to get the total number of wheels utilized.\n\n3. Add the wheels left in the box after assembly to find out the initial number of wheels that were in the box.\n\nWe'll use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import the required package\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the initial number of wheels in the box as a variable\nW = symbols('W')\n\n# Calculate the wheels required for cars and motorcycles\nwheels_for_cars = 57 * 4\nwheels_for_motorcycles = 73 * 2\ntotal_wheels_used = wheels_for_cars + wheels_for_motorcycles\n\n# Given that 276 wheels are left in the box\nwheels_left = 276\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(W - total_wheels_used, wheels_left)\n\n# Solve for the initial number of wheels in the box\ninitial_wheels = solve(equation, W)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'The initial number of wheels in the box is: {initial_wheels[0]}')\n```\n\nThis code will solve for the initial number of wheels in the box before Henry used any of them for assembling the cars and motorcycles."
