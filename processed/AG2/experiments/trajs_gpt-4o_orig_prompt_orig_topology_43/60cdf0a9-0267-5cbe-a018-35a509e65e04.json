You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem involves calculating the number of crayon muffins Kate can make and then finding the price per muffin crayon given the total sales amount.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of crayons Kate has:**\n   - Kate has 3 boxes, each containing 64 crayons. So, the total number of crayons is \\(3 \\times 64\\).\n\n2. **Determine the number of muffins she can make:**\n   - Each muffin crayon is made by melting 8 crayons together. Therefore, the number of muffins she can make is the total number of crayons divided by 8.\n\n3. **Find the price of each muffin:**\n   - Kate made $36 from selling all the muffin crayons. To find out how much each muffin crayon sells for, we divide the total sales by the number of muffins.\n\nLet's calculate these using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total crayons\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# Number of crayons per muffin\ncrayons_per_muffin = 8\n\n# Calculate number of muffins\ntotal_muffins = total_crayons // crayons_per_muffin\n\n# Total earnings\ntotal_earnings = 36\n\n# Calculate the price per muffin\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(total_earnings, total_muffins)\n\n# Print the price per muffin\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\n\nRun this code to find out how much each muffin crayon sells for."
