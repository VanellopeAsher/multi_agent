You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRichard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 6000 cherries.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use Case 3 because it involves some straightforward arithmetic reasoning.\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. We know Robert has 3000 cherries.\n2. We also know Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard.\n\n3. Using the above information, we can calculate the number of cherries Richard has:\n   - Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 1000\n\n4. Next, we need to determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:\n   - We know the total number of cherries is 6000, so Jerry's cherries can be calculated as follows:\n   - Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)\n\n5. Finally, we find the difference in cherries between Robert and Jerry:\n   - Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python.\n\n```python\n# Given data\ntotal_cherries = 6000\nrobert_cherries = 3000\ndifference_with_richard = 1000\n\n# Calculate Richard's cherries\nrichard_cherries = robert_cherries - difference_with_richard\n\n# Calculate Jerry's cherries\njerry_cherries = total_cherries - (robert_cherries + richard_cherries)\n\n# Calculate the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries\ndifference_with_jerry = robert_cherries - jerry_cherries\n\n# Output the result\nprint(difference_with_jerry)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the result using the steps above."
