You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Joey's initial score: 214 points.\n2. Let \\( x \\) be the number of points Joey scores in his turn.\n3. So, Joey's new score will be \\( 214 + x \\).\n\n4. Marcy's initial score: 225 points.\n5. Marcy scores 10 points, so her new score is \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\).\n\nTo find out by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to find the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score:\n\n\\[ \\text{Points Joey is winning by} = (214 + x) - 235 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the variable for Joey's scoring\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Joey's current score after his turn\njoey_score = 214 + x\n\n# Marcy's score after her round\nmarcy_score = 235\n\n# Calculate by how many points Joey is winning\npoints_winning_by = simplify(joey_score - marcy_score)\n\nprint(points_winning_by)\n```\n\nThis Python code will provide us the expression for how many points Joey is winning by in terms of \\( x \\).\n\nLet me know the value of \\( x \\) if you have it, or if you would like to interpret the output further!"
