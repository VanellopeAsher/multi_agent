You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

Calculate how much he spends from Sunday through Wednesday, and determine the number of wooden action figures he buys.\n3. Calculate how much he spends from Thursday to Saturday, and determine the number of plastic action figures he buys.\n4. Add the total number of action figures he buys during the week.\n\nLet's write a Python code using these steps.\n\n```python\n# Peter's total budget\ntotal_budget = 70\n\n# Number of days in the week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Calculate daily spending\ndaily_spending = total_budget / days_in_week\n\n# Cost of wooden and plastic action figures\ncost_wooden_figure = 5\ncost_plastic_figure = 2.5\n\n# Calculate the number of wooden figures bought (Sunday to Wednesday)\nwooden_days = 4\nwooden_figures = daily_spending * wooden_days / cost_wooden_figure\n\n# Calculate the number of plastic figures bought (Thursday to Saturday)\nplastic_days = 3\nplastic_figures = daily_spending * plastic_days / cost_plastic_figure\n\n# Total number of action figures\ntotal_figures = wooden_figures + plastic_figures\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_figures)\n```\n\nRunning this code will solve the problem and provide the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{28}\n\\]"
