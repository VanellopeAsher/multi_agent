The following day, they used ten bandages less than the previous day. On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages and only expended half a pack.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack.

Use these details to set up equations for each day to calculate the remaining bandages.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of bandages at the start of the first day.\n- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and bought one pack (50 bandages).\n- On the second day, they used \\( 38 - 10 = 28 \\) bandages.\n- On the third day, they bought two packs (100 bandages) and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.\n\nGiven that there are 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\nB - 38 + 50 - 28 + 50 + 100 - 25 = 78\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve the equation using Python and sympy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nB = symbols('B')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem details\nequation = Eq(B - 38 + 50 - 28 + 50 + 100 - 25, 78)\n\n# Solve for B\ninitial_bandages = solve(equation, B)[0]\n\nprint(initial_bandages)\n```\n\nBy executing this code, we find the value of \\( B \\), which tells us the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day. Let's compute this to get the answer."
