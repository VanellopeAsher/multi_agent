You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

      "content": "To solve this problem, start by defining the variables and translating the problem details into mathematical expressions. Let's follow the steps below:\n\n1. Define the Variables:\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n   - Since each small stuffed animal costs $40, the revenue from small stuffed animals is \\( 40x \\).\n\n2. Large Stuffed Animals:\n   - Given that large stuffed animals are three times the price of small ones, each costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\).\n   - Let \\( y \\) represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n   - The revenue from large stuffed animals is \\( 120y \\).\n\n3. Relationship between Small and Large:\n   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \\( x = 2y \\).\n\n4. Total Revenue Equation:\n   - The total revenue from sales is $1200: \n   \\[\n   40x + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute \\( x = 2y \\) into the total revenue equation:\n   - Substitute and solve for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   40(2y) + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   80y + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   200y = 1200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n   \\]\n\n6. Calculate the number of small stuffed animals sold:\n   - Since \\( x = 2y \\), substitute:\n   \\[\n   x = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.\n\nFinally, let's box the answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\nHere's the equivalent Python code to verify the calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define symbols\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Define relationship and equation based on the problem statement\nequation1 = Eq(x, 2*y)\nequation2 = Eq(40*x + 120*y, 1200)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (x, y))\n\n# Print the number of small stuffed animals sold\nprint(solution[x])\n```"

The number of small stuffed animals sold is \\( \\boxed{12} \\).\n\nHere's a brief recap of the solution:\n\n1. Each small stuffed animal costs $40.\n2. Large stuffed animals cost three times more, so $120 each.\n3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\( x = 2y \\).\n4. The total revenue from sales is $1200: \n   \\[\n   40x + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n5. Substituting the relationship \\( x = 2y \\):\n   \\[\n   80y + 120y = 1200 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 200y = 1200 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 6\n   \\]\n6. Therefore, \\( x = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\).\n\nThus, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals: \\( \\boxed{12} \\). \n\nIf you have further questions or need another problem solved, feel free to ask!"
