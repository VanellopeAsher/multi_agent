You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

We are given that Richie scored 90 goals, 30 more than Mark and 55 more than Anna. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Let \\( R \\) represent the number of goals Richie scored, \\( M \\) the number of goals Mark scored, and \\( A \\) the number of goals Anna scored.\n2. We know:\n   - \\( R = 90 \\)\n   - \\( R = M + 30 \\)\n   - \\( R = A + 55 \\)\n\nWe'll use these equations to solve for \\( M \\) and \\( A \\), and then add all the goals together. Let's do this using Python and the sympy library to solve the equations algebraically.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nM, A = symbols('M A')\n\n# Richie's goals\nR = 90\n\n# Equation 1: Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark\neq1 = Eq(R, M + 30)\n\n# Equation 2: Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna\neq2 = Eq(R, A + 55)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (M, A))\n\nM_value = solution[M]\nA_value = solution[A]\n\n# Total goals scored by all three teenagers\ntotal_goals = R + M_value + A_value\n\nprint(total_goals)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers."
