That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGeorge needs to pay for dental work.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll calculate George's total cost for the dental work and then determine how many hours he needs to work at his hourly wage to cover the remaining amount, taking into account the deposit he's already made.\n\nHere’s how to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the implants:\n   - Base cost for two implants.\n   - Additional cost for one implant with a porcelain crown.\n   \n2. Subtract the deposit he’s already paid from the total cost to get the remaining balance.\n\n3. Calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining balance by his hourly wage.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute the answer:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, ceiling\n\n# Calculating the total cost of the dental work\nbase_price_per_implant = Rational('2000.5')\ncrown_price = Rational('500.5')\ndeposit = Rational('600')\nhourly_wage = Rational('15.3')\n\n# Total cost for 2 implants, one with a porcelain crown\ntotal_cost = 2 * base_price_per_implant + crown_price\n\n# Remaining cost after deposit\nremaining_balance = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Calculate hours needed to work\nhours_needed = ceiling(remaining_balance / hourly_wage)\n\nprint(hours_needed)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll get the number of hours George needs to work to pay for his dental treatment."
