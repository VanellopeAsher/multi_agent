If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items, and he also decides to buy a pack of cookies for 2 dollars and a bottle of water for 1 dollar, how much did everything cost?

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn goes shopping and buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to break down the items into food and non-food categories, as the 10% tax is only applied to the non-food items. We can then calculate the total cost accordingly.\n\n### Key Idea:\n- First, categorize the items:\n  - Food items (no tax): milk, eggs, cookies, water\n  - Non-food items (10% tax): light bulbs, cups, roach traps\n- Calculate the total cost before tax.\n- Compute the tax for non-food items.\n- Sum up the total cost including applicable taxes.\n\nLet's implement this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices of individual items\nmilk_price = 2\neggs_price = 3\ncookies_price = 2\nwater_price = 1\nlight_bulbs_price = 3\ncups_price = 3\nroach_traps_price = 4\n\n# Total cost of food items (no tax)\ntotal_food_items = milk_price + eggs_price + cookies_price + water_price\n\n# Total cost of non-food items before tax\ntotal_non_food_items_before_tax = light_bulbs_price + cups_price + roach_traps_price\n\n# Tax on non-food items (10%)\ntax_rate = Rational(1, 10)\ntax_on_non_food_items = total_non_food_items_before_tax * tax_rate\n\n# Total cost including tax\ntotal_cost = total_food_items + total_non_food_items_before_tax + tax_on_non_food_items\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(f\"The total cost inclusive of tax is: {total_cost}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total cost of John's shopping inclusive of tax in an exact fractional form."
