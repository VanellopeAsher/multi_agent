Let's proceed with the step-by-step solution, using reasoning and calculation:\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Perimeter of the Fence:**\n   The backyard fence is a rectangle with a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet.\n   The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**\n   Substitute the given values into the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (20 + 15)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the Result:**\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nSince James does not need to hang streamers on the tree, and the tree does not affect the perimeter calculation, the total length of crepe paper required will be the same as the calculated perimeter of the fence.\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform and verify the computation:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of the perimeter of the fence\nlength = 20\nwidth = 15\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Output the total length of crepe paper needed\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nRunning this script will provide the output:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{70 \\text{ feet}}\n\\]\n\nJames needs to buy 70 feet of crepe-paper streamers for his fence."

Let's revisit the problem to ensure we've addressed James's needs for his birthday party:\n\n**Problem Recap:**\nJames plans to hang crepe-paper streamers around his backyard fence. The yard is a rectangle measuring 20 feet by 15 feet, and he wants to calculate the total number of feet of streamers needed without considering any obstacles like the tree in the center (since it doesn't affect the perimeter).\n\n**Solution Outline:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle (Fence):**  \n   The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n   \\]\n\n   Using the given values:\n   - Length = 20 feet\n   - Width = 15 feet\n\n   Substitute these into the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Conclusion:**  \n   James needs to purchase 70 feet of crepe-paper streamers, which matches the perimeter we've calculated.\n\nThe final answer for the length of crepe-paper streamers that James needs to buy is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{70 \\text{ feet}}\n\\]\n\nIf further queries are necessary or additional information is needed, please let me know!"
