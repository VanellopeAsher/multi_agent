You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, given certain age conditions in the future. Let's follow the steps below:\n\n1. Define the variables:\n   - Let \\( D \\) represent Emil's dad's current age.\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent Emil's brother's current age.\n\n2. Analyze the conditions given in the problem:\n   - Emil is currently 21 years old.\n   - When Emil turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad. This can be written as:\n     \\[\n     26 = \\frac{D + 5}{2}\n     \\]\n   - When Emil turns 26, he will be twice as old as his brother. This can be written as:\n     \\[\n     26 = 2 \\times (B + 5)\n     \\]\n\n3. We can solve the system of equations derived from the conditions above:\n\n   \\[\n   26 = \\frac{D + 5}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   26 = 2 \\times (B + 5)\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's use Python to solve these equations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nD, B = symbols('D B')\n\n# Add the equations derived from the problem\nequation1 = Eq(26, (D + 5) / 2)\nequation2 = Eq(26, 2 * (B + 5))\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (D, B))\n\n# Extract the dad's and brother's ages\ndad_age = solution[D]\nbrother_age = solution[B]\n\n# Calculate the sum of their current ages\nsum_of_ages = dad_age + brother_age\nsum_of_ages\n```\n\nLet's calculate these to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother."
