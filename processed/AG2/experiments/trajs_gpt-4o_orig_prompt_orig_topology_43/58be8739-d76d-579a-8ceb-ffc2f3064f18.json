You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "**Key Idea:** To solve this problem, we need to find out the total time John spent on vacation such that the time he spent watching shows represents 30% of the total. Once we find the total time, we can determine the time spent sightseeing by excluding the known activities.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Calculate the total time John spent on known activities: boating, swimming, and watching shows.\n2. Use the percentage information to find out the total time spent on vacation.\n3. Deduct the time spent on known activities from the total to find the time spent sightseeing.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate accordingly:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Symbol, solve\n\n# Calculate the time spent on known activities\nboating_time = 6  # hours\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2  # half of boating time\nshows_time = 2 * 3  # 3 shows, each 2 hours\n\n# Total known activities time\nknown_activities_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time\n\n# Use a symbolic variable for the total time spent on vacation\ntotal_time = Symbol('total_time', positive=True, real=True)\n\n# The shows time is 30% of the total time\nshows_percentage = 30 / 100\nequation = shows_percentage * total_time - shows_time\n\n# Solve for the total_time\ntotal_vacation_time = solve(equation, total_time)[0]\n\n# Time spent sightseeing is the difference\nsightseeing_time = total_vacation_time - known_activities_time\n\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nRunning this code will provide the time John spent sightseeing. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you would like me to run this code and provide the result."
