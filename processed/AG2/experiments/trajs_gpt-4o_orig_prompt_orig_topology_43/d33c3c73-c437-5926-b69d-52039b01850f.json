However, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. On Thursday, the tank's water depth increased by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday. What is the tank’s water depth on Thursday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

Determine the depth on Wednesday as two-thirds of Tuesday's depth.\n3. Compute the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n4. Find Thursday's depth by adding half of this difference to Wednesday's depth.\n\nLet's implement these calculations using Python with the `sympy` package to work with fractions:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Depth on Monday\ndepth_monday = 17\n\n# Depth on Tuesday\ndepth_tuesday = depth_monday + 7\n\n# Depth on Wednesday\ndepth_wednesday = Rational(2, 3) * depth_tuesday\n\n# Difference between Tuesday and Wednesday\ndifference = depth_tuesday - depth_wednesday\n\n# Depth on Thursday\ndepth_thursday = depth_wednesday + Rational(1, 2) * difference\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(depth_thursday)\n```\n\nNow, execute this code to find the water depth on Thursday."
