      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of eggs found by the friends of the Smith twins. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. Determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins.\n2. Find out how many eggs were not found by anyone (it is given that 10 eggs were not found).\n3. Use these facts to find how many eggs were found by their friends.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step:\n\n- The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. Since there are two twins, the total number of eggs found by the twins is:\n  \\[\n  30 \\text{ (eggs per twin)} \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ eggs}\n  \\]\n\n- Let \\( T \\) be the total number of eggs hidden. The problem states that all the eggs except 10 were found by their friends, meaning:\n  \\[\n  T - 10 = \\text{ eggs found by Smith twins} + \\text{ eggs found by friends}\n  \\]\n\n- We can express the eggs found by their friends as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{eggs found by friends} = T - 10 - \\text{ eggs found by Smith twins}\n  \\]\n\nFrom the inputs, we use the expression:\n\\[\n\\text{eggs found by friends} = T - 10 - 60\n\\]\n\n- Since \\( T - 60 \\) eggs remain, and 10 were not found, then the eggs found by friends is:\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this straightforward calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define total number of eggs hidden\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Total eggs found by twins\neggs_by_twins = 60\n\n# Equation: Total eggs = (eggs found by twins + eggs found by friends + eggs not found)\nequation = (T - 10) - eggs_by_twins\n\n# Solve for the eggs found by friends\neggs_found_by_friends = solve(equation, T)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends)\n```\n\nPlease run the Python code to verify the calculation, and then the result will give us the eggs found by friends."

      "content": "Great! From the output of the Python code, we found that the total number of eggs hidden, \\( T \\), is 70. \n\nGiven that the Smith twins found 60 eggs combined, we can calculate the number of eggs found by their friends:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Eggs found by friends} = T - 10 - \\text{Eggs found by twins} = 70 - 10 - 60 = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misunderstanding here; let me correct it. Since the output of the equation is not correct for giving eggs found by friends (as it should be substituted), let's clarify it:\n\n- Total eggs hidden \\( T = 70 \\)\n- Total eggs found = \\( T - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \\).\n\nThe actual calculation should be from this, the friends found \\( 60 - 60 = 0 \\).\n\nCorrecting this gives us:\n\\[\n\\text{Eggs found by friends} = 0.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the friends found \\(\\boxed{0}\\) eggs.\n\nIt seems my initial interpretation of the solution step was a mix-up, and the friends found indeed not add any because the twins found all (the total found by twins = remaining hidden after 10 unfound). Sorry for the logical confusions, the statement needs to reflect that situation correctly!"
