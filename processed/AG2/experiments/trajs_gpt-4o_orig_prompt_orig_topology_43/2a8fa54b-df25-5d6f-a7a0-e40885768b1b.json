You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the forgotten score given that the mean score is 70. Here is the plan to solve it:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) represent the forgotten score.\n2. Calculate the total sum of all scores including the forgotten one.\n3. Use the formula for the mean to set up the equation: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{sum of all scores}}{\\text{total number of scores}} = \\text{mean}\n   \\]\n4. Solve for the forgotten score \\( x \\).\n\nLet's go ahead and implement this in Python using `sympy` to solve the equation symbolically:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# List of scores including the unknown score 'x'\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# Define 'x' as the unknown score\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total number of scores including the forgotten score\nn_scores = len(scores) + 1  # We include the unknown score\n\n# Mean of the scores\nmean_score = 70\n\n# Set up the equation for the mean\nequation = Eq((sum(scores) + x) / n_scores, mean_score)\n\n# Solve for the unknown score 'x'\nforgotten_score = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The forgotten score is: {forgotten_score[0]}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will tell you the forgotten score needed to reach a mean of 70. Using the symbolic solver ensures we work with fractions if needed."
