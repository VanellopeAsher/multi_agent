You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which a single individual paints and then use that rate to find out how much time it takes for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Find the rate of one individual:**\n   - A single individual takes 5 days to paint half a house.\n   - Therefore, one individual takes \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) days to paint an entire house.\n   - The rate of one individual is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) house per day.\n\n2. **Determine the rate of 5 individuals:**\n   - If 5 individuals work together, their combined rate is \\(5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) house per day.\n\n3. **Calculate the time for 5 individuals to paint one house:**\n   - To paint one entire house, they would need \\(1 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 2\\) days.\n\n4. **Convert the time from days to hours:**\n   - Since one day has 24 hours, \\(2\\) days equals \\(2 \\times 24 = 48\\) hours.\n\nUsing Python, let's confirm and print these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Individual rate (house per day)\nindividual_rate = Rational(1, 10)\n\n# Team rate for 5 individuals\nteam_rate = 5 * individual_rate\n\n# Time (days) for 5 individuals to paint the entire house\ntime_days = 1 / team_rate\n\n# Time in hours\ntime_hours = time_days * 24\n\n# Print the result as a fraction\nprint(time_hours)\n```\n\nRunning this code should confirm that it takes the team of 5 individuals \\(\\boxed{48}\\) hours to paint an entire house."
