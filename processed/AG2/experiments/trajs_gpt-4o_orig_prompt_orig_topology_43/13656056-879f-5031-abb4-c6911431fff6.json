You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $300 every day.

We will calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week, subtract the amount he spent, and then determine how much he has left.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation process:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings for the week: \\( \\text{earnings per day} \\times \\text{days in a week} \\).\n2. Subtract the total amount spent.\n3. Output the remaining money using Python.\n\nLet's go ahead and write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Gerald's earnings per day\nearnings_per_day = 300\n\n# Number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Total earnings for the week\ntotal_earnings = earnings_per_day * days_in_week\n\n# Total amount spent\namount_spent = 1000\n\n# Money Gerald has left\nmoney_left = total_earnings - amount_spent\n\n# Print the result\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nRun this code to find out how much money Gerald has left."
