You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11.

Let's follow the steps below to determine Allen's age ten years from now:\n\n1. **Establish Variables for Ages:** Let Darrell's age be \\( 7x \\) and Allen's age be \\( 11x \\) based on the age ratio given.\n2. **Use the Total Age Equation:** Given that their total age is 162, we form the equation \\( 7x + 11x = 162 \\).\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):** Solve this equation to find the value of \\( x \\).\n4. **Calculate Allen's Current Age:** Determine Allen's age now by evaluating \\( 11x \\).\n5. **Calculate Allen's Age 10 Years from Now:** Add 10 to Allen's current age to find his age ten years from now.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Establish equation based on age ratio and total age\nequation = Eq(7*x + 11*x, 162)\n\n# Solve for x\nx_value = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate Allen's current age\nallen_age_now = 11 * x_value\n\n# Determine Allen's age 10 years from now\nallen_age_10_years_later = allen_age_now + 10\n\n# Print the result\nprint(allen_age_10_years_later)\n```\n\nThis Python code will solve for Allen's age ten years from now using the given ratios and total age."
