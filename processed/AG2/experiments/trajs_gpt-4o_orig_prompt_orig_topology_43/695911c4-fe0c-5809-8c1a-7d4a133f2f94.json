The cost per visit for the first 10 years was $10, with Pauline visiting 3 times a year, resulting in a total of \\(30\\) visits during this period.\n2. After a 150% increase, the cost per visit became \\(10 \\times 2.5 = 25\\) dollars.\n3. Pauline continued visiting for an additional 3 years with 3 visits each year, resulting in \\(9\\) more visits.\n4. Calculate the total expenditure for both periods:\n   - The first 10 years: \\(30\\) visits at $10 each = $300.\n   - The next 3 years: \\(9\\) visits at $25 each = $225.\n5. The total expenditure: \\(300 + 225 = 525\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total amount Pauline spent on all of her visits is \\(\\boxed{525}\\)."
