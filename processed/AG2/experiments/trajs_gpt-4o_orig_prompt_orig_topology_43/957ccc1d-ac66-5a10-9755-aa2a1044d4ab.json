The key idea is to determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds and then calculate the daily calorie deficit required over the period from December 31st to July 19th.\n\n1. Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ pounds} \\times 3500 \\text{ calories/pound} = 105,000 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.\n\n3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit by dividing the total calorie deficit by the number of days.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Calculate total calorie deficit\ncalories_per_pound = 3500\nweight_loss_goal_pounds = 30\ntotal_calorie_deficit = weight_loss_goal_pounds * calories_per_pound\n\n# Calculate number of days between December 31st and July 19th\nstart_date = datetime(year=2023, month=12, day=31)\nend_date = datetime(year=2024, month=7, day=19)\ndays_difference = (end_date - start_date).days\n\n# Calculate daily calorie deficit\ndaily_calorie_deficit = total_calorie_deficit / days_difference\n\n# Print the result as a fraction\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Rational is used to keep the output in a fractional form if needed\ndaily_calorie_deficit_fraction = Rational(total_calorie_deficit, days_difference)\nprint(daily_calorie_deficit_fraction)\n```\n\nRunning this program will give us the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal."

So, the calculated daily calorie deficit is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{35000}{67}\n\\]\n\nIn simplest fractional form, this fraction can be further reduced if needed, but it's already quite simplified. Let's verify if the fraction can be simplified any further using Python's sympy library:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import simplify\n\n# Simplify the fraction\nsimplified_fraction = simplify(35000/67)\nprint(simplified_fraction)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the result is in its simplest form. If it's already simplified, the output will be the same.
