You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Case 1, where we'll write a Python program to compute the total amount Jessica needs to pay in a year. The key idea is to first calculate the monthly payment by including the 50% increase on the minimum payments, and then multiply it by 12 to find the annual payment.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. Calculate each monthly minimum payment:\n   - Student loans: $3000\n   - Credit card: $2000\n   - Mortgage: $5000\n\n2. Increase each monthly minimum payment by 50%:\n   - 50% increase means multiplying each minimum payment by 1.5\n\n3. Calculate the total monthly payment by summing the increased payments.\n\n4. Calculate the annual payment by multiplying the total monthly payment by 12.\n\nHere is the Python code to compute it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Minimum monthly payments\nstudent_loans_min = 3000\ncredit_card_min = 2000\nmortgage_min = 5000\n\n# Increase by 50%\nincrease_factor = Rational(3, 2)  # This denotes 1.5 in fractional form\n\n# Calculate increased monthly payments\nstudent_loans_payment = student_loans_min * increase_factor\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min * increase_factor\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min * increase_factor\n\n# Total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loans_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Annual payment\nannual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Output in fraction form\nprint(annual_payment)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount Jessica needs to pay in a year in its exact fractional form."
