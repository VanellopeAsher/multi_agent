You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSeth is twice as old as Brooke.

Let \\( S \\) be Seth's current age and \\( B \\) be Brooke's current age.\n2. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we have the equation: \n   \\[\n   S = 2B\n   \\]\n3. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36. Therefore, \n   \\[\n   (S + 3) + (B + 3) = 36\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   S + B + 6 = 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S + B = 30\n   \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\\[\nS = 2B\n\\]\n\\[\nS + B = 30\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this system using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nS, B = symbols('S B')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(S, 2 * B)\neq2 = Eq(S + B, 30)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (S, B))\n\n# Output the solution for Seth's age\nprint(solution[S])\n```\n\nThis code will solve the equations and print Seth's current age in its simplest form."
