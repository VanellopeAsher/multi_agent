We will use algebraic reasoning to set up and solve this problem with Python. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define variables:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of 5 canvas bags Tara bought.\n\n2. Define the cost and revenue:\n   - The cost for \\( x \\) packs is \\( 4x \\) dollars.\n   - The number of canvas bags is \\( 5x \\).\n   - The revenue from selling these bags is \\( 8 \\times 5x = 40x \\) dollars.\n\n3. Define the profit:\n   - Profit is revenue minus cost, so her profit is \\( 40x - 4x = 36x \\) dollars.\n\n4. Set up the equation for profit:\n   - We know the profit is $160, so \\( 36x = 160 \\).\n\n5. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the profit equation\nprofit_eq = Eq(36 * x, 160)\n\n# Solve for the number of packs Tara bought\npacks_bought = solve(profit_eq, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(packs_bought[0])\n```\n\nThis code sets up the equation and uses SymPy to solve for the number of packs of 5 canvas bags Tara bought. Once you run this code, it will give you the number of packs."
