You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We'll calculate the total amount of money Colby has and then determine how many gumballs he can purchase. Let's assume the cost of each gumball is $0.25 (25 cents), a typical price for gumball machines.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Colby has using quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.\n2. Determine how many gumballs Colby can purchase with this total amount.\n\nSteps:\n- Quarters are worth 25 cents each.\n- Dimes are worth 10 cents each.\n- Nickels are worth 5 cents each.\n- Pennies are worth 1 cent each.\n- Calculate the total cents Colby has.\n- Calculate how many gumballs he can buy (assuming each gumball costs 25 cents).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Values of coins in cents\nvalue_of_quarter = 25\nvalue_of_dime = 10\nvalue_of_nickel = 5\nvalue_of_penny = 1\n\n# Number of each type of coin\nnum_quarters = 8\nnum_dimes = 6\nnum_nickels = 14\nnum_pennies = 15\n\n# Calculate total amount of money in cents\ntotal_cents = (num_quarters * value_of_quarter + \n               num_dimes * value_of_dime + \n               num_nickels * value_of_nickel + \n               num_pennies * value_of_penny)\n\n# Each gumball costs 25 cents\ncost_per_gumball = 25\n\n# Calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy\nnum_gumballs = total_cents // cost_per_gumball\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Total money in cents: {Rational(total_cents, 1)}\")\nprint(f\"Number of gumballs Colby can buy: {Rational(num_gumballs, 1)}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of gumballs Colby can purchase with his total money."
