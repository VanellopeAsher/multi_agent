You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.

Gerald earns $30 per day.\n2. He worked for an entire week (7 days).\n3. He saved a total of $110 by the end of the week.\n\nWe want to find out how much he spent during that week. \n\nThe total amount he earned in the week is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Total Earnings} = 30 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThe amount he spent can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Amount Spent} = \\text{Total Earnings} - \\text{Savings} \\]\n\nWe'll write a Python program to do this calculation using the specified format.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the daily wage and number of days in a week\ndaily_wage = 30\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Total earnings in a week\ntotal_earnings = daily_wage * days_in_week\n\n# Saved amount\nsaved_amount = 110\n\n# Calculate the amount spent\namount_spent = total_earnings - saved_amount\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The amount spent by Gerald: {amount_spent} dollars\")\n```\n\nOnce you run this code, you'll find out how much Gerald spent."
