You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of vacation time John spent and then calculate how much time he spent on sightseeing, which is 40% of that total time.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Calculate the total time John spent on each activity:\n   - Boating: 6.6 hours\n   - Swimming: Half of the boating time\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows, each 2.5 hours\n\n2. The time spent watching shows accounts for 30% of his total vacation time. Use this information to find the total vacation time.\n\n3. Once we have the total vacation time, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing (40% of the total time).\n\nLet's use Python to compute these values.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Define variables\ntotal_time = symbols('total_time')\n\n# Time spent on activities\nboating_time = 6.6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 3 * 2.5  # 3 shows, each 2.5 hours\n\n# Set up the equation given that the time watching shows is 30% of total time\nequation = Eq(shows_time, total_time * Rational(30, 100))\n\n# Solve for total time\ntotal_time_value = solve(equation, total_time)[0]\n\n# Calculate time spent sightseeing (40% of total time)\nsightseeing_time = total_time_value * Rational(40, 100)\n\nprint(total_time_value)\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nNow let's run the code to find out how much time John spent sightseeing."
