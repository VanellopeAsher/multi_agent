You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

We know that he runs twice as much on one day and half as much on the other two days. We'll calculate the miles he runs on these days.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of miles he runs on the first day.\n2. Then, he runs \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) miles on each of the other two days.\n\nThe total distance he runs in a week is:\n\n\\[ x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} = 60 \\]\n\nWe will solve this equation to find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation representing the total weekly mileage\nequation = x + x/2 + x/2 - 60\n\n# Solve the equation\nmiles_first_day = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'Miles run on the first day: {miles_first_day}')\nprint(f'Miles run on each of the other two days: {miles_first_day/2}')\n\n# Calculate the average speed assuming these are total miles run per day\ntotal_days = 3\ntotal_miles = 60\naverage_miles_per_day = total_miles / total_days\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'Average miles per day: {average_miles_per_day}')\n```\n\nLet's solve this step to find out how many miles John runs on each day and his average distance per day.\n\nOnce we find the breakdown of miles per day, we can interpret \"how fast does he run\" in terms of miles per day since we haven't been provided with specific time data for speed. If you meant finding miles per hour or similar, additional data would be necessary."
