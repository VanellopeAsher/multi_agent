  "problem": "There are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "In this problem, we need to determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France. To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Let the total number of flights made by the first aircraft each day be \\( x \\).\n2. According to the problem, the second aircraft's 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft.\n   \\[\n   \\text{So, } \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n   \\]\n3. Solve for \\( x \\) in the equation from step 2.\n4. Once \\( x \\) is determined, calculate the flights to France:\n   - \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the flights go to Greece.\n   - The remaining \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) are divided equally between France and Germany.\n   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of \\( x \\).\n\nNow, I'll execute this reasoning in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Add the equation representing half the total flights\nequation = Eq(x / 2, 44)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_flights_first_aircraft = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate flights to France\nflights_to_France = total_flights_first_aircraft / 8\n\n# Display the number of daily flights to France\nprint(flights_to_France)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed, it will give us the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France. Let's calculate this."
