You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there.

We can use Python to perform these calculations. \n\nLet's break down the given information and structure our problem:\n\n1. We know the number of helmets, which are 2000.\n2. Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, so the number of robots is \\( \\frac{2000}{2} \\).\n3. Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs, so the number of footballs is \\( 2 \\times 2000 \\).\n\nFinally, we will sum up all the items (robots, helmets, and footballs) to find the total number.\n\n```python\n# Given\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# Calculating number of robots\nrobots = helmets // 2\n\n# Calculating number of footballs\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\n# Total number of items\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\n\n# Print the total number of items\nprint(total_items)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total number of items Dominick saw."
