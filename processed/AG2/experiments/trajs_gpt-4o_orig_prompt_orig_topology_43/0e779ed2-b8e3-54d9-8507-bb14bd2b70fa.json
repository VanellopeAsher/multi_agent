You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

Determine the age of the sisters.\n   - All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times ten.\n   - Calculate \\(1.6 \\times 10\\).\n\n2. Determine the age of the younger brother.\n   - The younger brother is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 \\) years old.\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 \\).\n\n3. Determine the age of the older brother.\n   - The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother.\n   - Use the age of the younger brother to find the older brother's age.\n\n4. Calculate the total age of all siblings.\n   - Add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python with the `sympy` package to ensure that we maintain fractions and avoid decimals where needed.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the age of each sibling\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10\nyounger_brother_age = Rational(3, 5) * 20\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Total age calculation\ntotal_age = 3 * sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nLet's execute this program."
