You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.50 apiece, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4.50 apiece and 13 blueberry muffins that were $1.50 apiece.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into straightforward calculations involving the cost of each type of item Marcus purchased and then apply the discount. Since these steps involve basic arithmetic, this can be directly handled using Python.\n\nKey Idea: This is a direct computation problem, so we can write a program to solve it.\n\nLet's write the Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total cost before discount\ncroissants_cost = 5 * 3.50\ncinnamon_rolls_cost = 4 * 2.50\nmini_quiches_cost = 3 * 4.50\nblueberry_muffins_cost = 13 * 1.50\n\ntotal_cost = croissants_cost + cinnamon_rolls_cost + mini_quiches_cost + blueberry_muffins_cost\n\n# Apply the 10% discount\ndiscount_percentage = 10\ndiscount = total_cost * (discount_percentage / 100)\ntotal_bill_after_discount = total_cost - discount\n\n# Print the total bill in fraction form using sympy\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Convert the total bill to a fraction\nfraction_total_bill = Rational(total_bill_after_discount).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(fraction_total_bill)\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the total cost of each type of item and then finds the overall total. Subsequently, it applies a 10% discount and finally presents the total bill in its fractional form using the `sympy` library. The use of `Rational` ensures that our output is shown as a fraction rather than a decimal."
