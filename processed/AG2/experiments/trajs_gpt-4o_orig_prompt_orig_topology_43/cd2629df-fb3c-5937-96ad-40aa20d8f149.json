You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount Stephen owes, including the 2% interest. Then, we determine the amount he pays back over the first 11 months and calculate the remaining balance to be paid in the twelfth month.\n\n**Key Idea**: Case 1 - We can directly calculate the amount using Python by keeping track of monthly payments and determining the final payment required.\n\nLet's execute the steps to solve this using Python:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount Stephen owes, including interest: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Owed} = \\text{Principal} + (\\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Interest Rate})\n   \\]\n   where Principal = $300 and Interest Rate = 2\\%.\n\n2. Calculate the total amount paid over the first 11 months.\n\n3. Subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount owed to find out how much he needs to pay in the twelfth month.\n\nNow, let's write a Python program to compute this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial principal\nprincipal = 300\n\n# Interest rate\ninterest_rate = Rational(2, 100) # 2%\n\n# Total amount owed including interest\ntotal_owed = principal + principal * interest_rate\n\n# Monthly payment for the first 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\nmonths_paid = 11\n\n# Total paid over the first 11 months\ntotal_paid_for_11_months = monthly_payment * months_paid\n\n# Remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month\nremaining_payment = total_owed - total_paid_for_11_months\n\n# Print the result\nprint(remaining_payment)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases. The answer will be displayed in fractional form, if necessary."
