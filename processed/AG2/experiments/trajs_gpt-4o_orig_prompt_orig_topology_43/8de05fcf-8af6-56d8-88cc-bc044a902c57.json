A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.  Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.If she spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days, how many times as many articles did she write on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

Monday: \\( m = 5 \\).\n2. Tuesday: \\( t = m + \\frac{2}{5}m = 5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5 \\).\n3. Total number of hours spent writing articles: \\( 4m + 4t + 4w = 104 \\).\n\nUsing this system, we find \\( t \\) and then \\( w \\), and finally how many times \\( w \\) is multiple of \\( t \\).\n\nLet's compute this with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nm = 5\nt = m + (2/5) * m\n\n# Define the variable for the number of articles on Wednesday\nw = Symbol('w')\n\n# Set up the equation for the total hours\nequation = Eq(4*m + 4*t + 4*w, 104)\n\n# Solve for w\nsolution_w = solve(equation, w)[0]\n\n# Find the ratio of articles written on Wednesday to those written on Tuesday\nratio = solution_w / t\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"w: {solution_w}, t: {t}, ratio: {ratio}\")\n```\n\nLet's calculate these values and see the results."
