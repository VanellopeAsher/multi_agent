You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nColby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each.

We will use Python to perform the calculations, taking advantage of the sympy package for handling fractions.\n\nLet's proceed with solving this problem using Case 1, as the calculations can be directly handled in Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the value of each type of coin in terms of nickels (since gumballs cost a nickel each)\n# A quarter is 25 cents, a dime is 10 cents, a nickel is 5 cents, and a penny is 1 cent.\nquarters = 80 * 25  # Total value from quarters in cents\ndimes = 60 * 10     # Total value from dimes in cents\nnickels = 140 * 5   # Total value from nickels in cents\npennies = 150 * 1   # Total value from pennies in cents\n\n# Total value in cents\ntotal_cents = quarters + dimes + nickels + pennies\n\n# Since gumballs cost 5 cents each, find how many gumballs Colby can buy\ngumballs = total_cents / 5\n\n# Print the number of gumballs\nprint('The total number of gumballs Colby can buy is:', gumballs)\n```\n\nThe calculation will yield the total number of gumballs Colby can purchase. Let's run this code to get the answer."
