You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJordan plays video games every day.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week, and then calculate how much money he could earn instead if he spent those hours working at his part-time job, where he earns $10 per hour.\n\nSince the problem does not specify the exact number of hours Jordan spends playing video games, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume Jordan plays video games for \\(x\\) hours per day.\n\nGiven that there are 7 days in a week, if Jordan spends \\(x\\) hours per day playing video games, he would play for \\(7x\\) hours in one week. Therefore, if he spent this time working, he would earn:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings per week} = 10 \\times 7x\n\\]\n\nThus, we follow Case 1, directly using Python to calculate his possible weekly earnings based on the number of hours \\(x\\) he plays video games each day.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the weekly earnings if Jordan spends x hours per day working\nweekly_earnings = 10 * 7 * x\n\n# Simplify and print the result\nprint(simplify(weekly_earnings))\n```\n\nThis code calculates and prints the expression for Jordan's weekly earnings based on his daily video game playing hours. All you need to do is substitute the actual number of hours he spends playing video games per day to find out the earnings."

This is calculated by multiplying the hourly wage ($10) by the total number of hours he would work in a week (7 days times \\(x\\) hours per day).\n\nHence, Jordan's potential earnings in one week can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{70x}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(x\\) is the number of hours Jordan plays video games each day."
