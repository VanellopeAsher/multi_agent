You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number.

      "content": "To find the audience size according to Courtney, we need to understand the relationship between Courtney's reported number and the actual number of people.\n\nKelly claims that Courtney overstated the audience size by 20%. This means that Courtney's reported number is 120% of the actual audience size.\n\nKey idea: We can solve this problem directly using a simple calculation.\n\nLet's go through the calculations:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the audience size according to Courtney.\n2. According to the problem, Courtney's number is 120% of the actual number of attendees, which is 40.\n3. Thus, we have the equation: \\( x = 1.2 \\times 40 \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to adhere to the format requirement:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate Courtney's reported audience size\nactual_audience = 40\noverstated_factor = Rational(120, 100)  # 120%\ncourtneys_audience = overstated_factor * actual_audience\n\n# Output the result\nprint(courtneys_audience)\n```\n\nThis will give you the audience size according to Courtney in the form of a fraction or radical, as required."
