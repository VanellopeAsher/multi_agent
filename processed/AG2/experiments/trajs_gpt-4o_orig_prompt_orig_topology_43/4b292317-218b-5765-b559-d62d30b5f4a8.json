You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts.

Divide the total length of the ribbon (in millimeters) by the number of equal parts it should be cut into initially (40 parts).\n2. Then divide each of those parts further into 50 equal parts.\n3. The result will give us the length of each final cut.\n\nThis problem can be directly solved using Python code.\n\nHere's the Python code to find the length of each final cut:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total length of the ribbon in millimeters\ntotal_length = 10000\n\n# First division: into 40 equal parts\nlength_per_part = Rational(total_length, 40)\n\n# Second division: each part into 50 equal parts\nfinal_length_per_cut = Rational(length_per_part, 50)\n\n# Print the final length of each cut\nprint(final_length_per_cut)\n```\n\nRun this code to obtain the length of each final cut in fractional form."

First, he cuts this into 40 equal parts:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10000}{40} = 250 \\text{ millimeters per part}\n   \\]\n3. Each of these 40 parts is then divided into 50 smaller equal parts:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\text{ millimeters per final cut}\n   \\]\n\nSo each final piece of ribbon is 5 millimeters long."
