You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.

Calculate the number of 30-minute intervals in that time period.\n\nKey Idea: This is a straightforward calculation that can be directly handled with Python code.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Time for a normal sudoku in minutes\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30\n\n# Time for an extreme sudoku in minutes\nextreme_sudoku_time = 3 * normal_sudoku_time\n\n# Time John drinks a bottle of water (in minutes)\nwater_interval = 30\n\n# Calculate the number of water bottles John drinks in the extreme sudoku time\nbottles_of_water = extreme_sudoku_time // water_interval\n\n# Print the result\nprint(bottles_of_water)\n```\n\nLet's run the code and find out the number of bottles of water John drinks."
