You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena pays the initial monthly amount of $200.\n2. For the second half of the year (the remaining 6 months), Aleena pays 15% less than the initial amount.\n3. We'll calculate the total amount paid for each half of the year and sum them up to get the total payment.\n\nThis problem can be handled directly with Python code.\n\n```python\n# The initial monthly charge\ninitial_monthly_charge = 200\n\n# Calculate the total for the first half of the year (6 months at the initial charge)\nfirst_half_total = initial_monthly_charge * 6\n\n# Calculate the reduced monthly charge (15% less)\nreduced_monthly_charge = initial_monthly_charge * (1 - 0.15)\n\n# Calculate the total for the second half of the year (6 months at the reduced charge)\nsecond_half_total = reduced_monthly_charge * 6\n\n# Calculate the total amount paid by the end of the year\ntotal_amount_paid = first_half_total + second_half_total\n\n# Output the total amount paid\nprint(total_amount_paid)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year."
