  "problem": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum.

Determine the cost of the grape gum.\n3. Determine the cost of the green apple gum.\n4. Sum these costs to find the total amount paid.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. The cost of each strawberry gum pack is $2, and she got two packs. So, the total cost for strawberry packs is:\n   - \\(2 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$2/\\text{pack} = \\$4\\).\n\n2. Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.\n\n3. The cost of the green apple gum is half the price of the grape gum:\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$2 = \\$1\\).\n\n4. Add all these costs together to get the total amount paid by Suzie:\n   - Total cost = Cost for strawberry packs + Cost for grape gum + Cost for green apple gum.\n\nWe can write a Python program to calculate this.\n\n```python\n# Define costs\nstrawberry_cost_per_pack = 2\nnumber_of_strawberry_packs = 2\ngrape_cost_per_pack = 2\ngreen_apple_cost_per_pack = grape_cost_per_pack / 2\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = (strawberry_cost_per_pack * number_of_strawberry_packs) + grape_cost_per_pack + green_apple_cost_per_pack\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the total cost."
