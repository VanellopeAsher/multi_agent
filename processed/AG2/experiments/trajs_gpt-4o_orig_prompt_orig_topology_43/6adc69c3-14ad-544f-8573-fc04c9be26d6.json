You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we can break it down into a few steps. Here's how we can handle it:\n\n**Key Idea**: Calculate the total length of the ribbon based on the relationship between the parts and the lengths provided.\n\n1. Marty cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts.\n2. Each of these 4 parts is then divided into 5 equal parts.\n3. Each of these final parts is 5 cm long.\n\nGiven this information, we need to determine the total length of the ribbon.\n\nThe approach is:\n- Calculate the length of one of the 4 equal parts.\n- Calculate the total length from the information about the final part length.\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python using expressions with sympy to keep it in exact form:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let 'L' be the total length of the ribbon\nL = symbols('L', positive=True)\n\n# Given that Marty cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts\n# Then each part is further divided into 5 equal parts, each being 5 cm in length\n# So, L/4/5 = 5 cm\n\n# Setup the equation\nequation = Eq(L / 4 / 5, 5)\n\n# Solve for L\ntotal_length = solve(equation, L)[0]\n\nprint(total_length)\n```\n\nThis code uses the sympy library to symbolically solve the equation for the total length of the ribbon. It sets up the equation based on the multiple divisions and the given 5 cm length of the smallest part, and then solves it to find \\( L \\), the total length of the ribbon.\n\nNow, let's calculate and find the length of the ribbon:\n\n1. Marty divides the ribbon into 4 parts.\n2. Each part is again divided into 5 parts, making 20 parts in total.\n3. Each of these final parts is 5 cm, so:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ribbon length} = 20 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total length of the ribbon \\( L \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100 \\text{ cm}}\n\\]\n\nThis matches our calculation; each of the smallest pieces being 5 cm results in a total ribbon length of 100 cm."
