You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Calculate the total weight lost during the 3 months he was unwell.\n2. Calculate the total weight gained during the 2 months of his recovery.\n3. Use these values to determine his initial weight, given his final weight.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this problem.\n\n```python\n# Parameters from the problem\nweight_loss_per_month = 10  # pounds lost per month when unwell\nmonths_unwell = 3\nweight_gain_per_month = 5  # pounds gained per month during recovery\nmonths_recovery = 2\nfinal_weight = 70  # final weight after recovery\n\n# Calculate total weight lost during illness\ntotal_weight_lost = weight_loss_per_month * months_unwell\n\n# Calculate total weight gained during recovery\ntotal_weight_gained = weight_gain_per_month * months_recovery\n\n# Calculate initial weight\ninitial_weight = final_weight + total_weight_lost - total_weight_gained\n\n# Output the initial weight\nprint(f\"Mark's initial weight before he fell ill was {initial_weight} pounds.\")\n```\n\nNow, by running the code, we find Mark's initial weight before he fell ill.

Given his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial weight} = \\text{Final weight} + \\text{Total weight lost} - \\text{Total weight gained}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial weight} = 70 \\text{ pounds} + 30 \\text{ pounds} - 10 \\text{ pounds} = 90 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mark's initial weight before he fell ill was indeed \\(\\boxed{90}\\) pounds.
