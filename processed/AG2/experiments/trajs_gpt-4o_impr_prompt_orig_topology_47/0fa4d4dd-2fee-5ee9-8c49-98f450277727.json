      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Sara needs to afford the jacket and the shoes, how much money she currently has, and how much more she needs to earn by mowing the lawn.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Cost**\n\nSara wants to buy:\n1. A jacket costing $120.\n2. Two pairs of shoes, each costing $100.\n\nTotal Cost = Cost of jacket + Cost of shoes\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 120 + (2 \\times 100) = 120 + 200 = 320 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Savings**\n\nSara currently has:\n1. $100 initially saved.\n2. Earns $5 per babysitting session for 10 sessions.\n\nTotal Saved = Initial savings + Earnings from babysitting\n\\[ \\text{Total Saved} = 100 + (10 \\times 5) = 100 + 50 = 150 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Amount Needed** \n\nAmount Needed = Total cost - Total saved\n\\[ \\text{Amount Needed} = 320 - 150 = 170 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine Times to Mow Lawn**\n\nSara earns $10 for each lawn mowed. Let \\( x \\) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn.\n\nShe needs to earn $170, so:\n\\[ 10x = 170 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{170}{10} = 17 \\]\n\nSara must mow the lawn 17 times to afford the jacket and the shoes.\n\n**Solution Verification:**\n\n1. Verify Total Cost:\n   - Jacket: $120\n   - 2 Pairs of Shoes: $200\n   - Total: $320\n\n2. Verify Total Savings:\n   - Initial savings: $100\n   - Babysitting earnings: $50\n   - Total savings: $150\n\n3. Verify Amount Needed:\n   - Total cost: $320\n   - Total savings: $150\n   - Amount needed: $170\n\n4. Verify Mowing Lawn Requirements:\n   - Amount needed: $170\n   - Earnings per lawn: $10\n   - Times to mow: \\( \\frac{170}{10} = 17 \\)\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is Sara needs to mow the lawn \\(\\boxed{17}\\) times."
