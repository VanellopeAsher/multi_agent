Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents, how many cents will she have left?"

      "content": "To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after her purchases, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Key Idea:\nKelly needs to pay for a can of pop and a candy bar. We need to first calculate her total amount of money and then subtract the total cost of her purchases from it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Amount of Money Kelly Has:**\n   - Kelly has 5 quarters. The value of one quarter is 25 cents.\n   - Kelly has 2 dimes. The value of one dime is 10 cents.\n\n2. **Calculate Cost of Purchases:**\n   - A can of pop costs 55 cents.\n   - A candy bar costs 45 cents.\n\n3. **Determine How Much Money Kelly Has Left:**\n   - Subtract the total cost of the purchases from the total amount of money Kelly has.\n\nLet's compute this using Python code with the sympy library to keep logical steps and clarity.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the number and value of coins\nquarters = 5\ndimes = 2\nvalue_of_quarter = 25  # cents\nvalue_of_dime = 10  # cents\n\n# Calculate the total money Kelly has\ntotal_money = quarters * value_of_quarter + dimes * value_of_dime\n\n# Define the cost of the items\ncost_of_pop = 55  # cents\ncost_of_candy_bar = 45  # cents\n\n# Calculate the total cost of items\ntotal_cost = cost_of_pop + cost_of_candy_bar\n\n# Calculate remaining money\nmoney_left = total_money - total_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Money left: {money_left} cents\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. Calculate Total Money:  \n   \\[ 5 \\text{ quarters} \\times 25 \\cents + 2 \\text{ dimes} \\times 10 \\cents = 125 \\cents + 20 \\cents = 145 \\cents \\]\n\n2. Calculate Total Cost:  \n   \\[ 55 \\cents (\\text{can of pop}) + 45 \\cents (\\text{candy bar}) = 100 \\cents \\]\n\n3. Calculate Money Left:  \n   \\[ 145 \\cents (\\text{total money}) - 100 \\cents (\\text{total cost}) = 45 \\cents \\]\n\nThe calculations confirm the steps taken, and our logic is consistent.\n\nThus, the number of cents Kelly will have left is \\(\\boxed{45}\\)."
