Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of brownies Greta ended the day with. The process involves adding and subtracting the amounts appropriately.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of brownies Greta made for herself**:\n   - Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.\n   - 1 dozen equals 12 brownies.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of brownies from her office party**:\n   - She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office.\n   - 1/2 dozen equals \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) brownies.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of brownies from her friend's surprise party**:\n   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies.\n   - 4 dozen equals \\( 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\) brownies.\n\n4. **Calculate the brownies eaten during the party**:\n   - 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.\n   - 1 1/2 dozen equals \\( 1.5 \\times 12 = 18 \\) brownies.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially and subtract the eaten ones to find how many she had left**:\n   - Total brownies Greta had initially: \\( 12 + 6 + 48 \\).\n   - Total eaten: 18 brownies.\n\nNow, let's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initialize quantities\nmade_for_herself = 12  # 1 dozen\noffice_party_brownies = 6  # 1/2 dozen\nsurprise_party_brownies = 48  # 4 dozen\neaten_brownies = 18  # 1 1/2 dozen\n\n# Total brownies Greta received\ntotal_brownies = made_for_herself + office_party_brownies + surprise_party_brownies\n\n# Calculate leftover brownies\nleftover_brownies = total_brownies - eaten_brownies\n\n# Print the result\nprint(leftover_brownies)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day. Let's verify our solution.\n\n**VERIFICATION**:\n- Made for herself: 12\n- Office: 6\n- Friends: 48\n- Total initially: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66\n- Eaten: 18\n- Leftover: 66 - 18 = 48\n\nWe have verified that the calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{48}\\)"
