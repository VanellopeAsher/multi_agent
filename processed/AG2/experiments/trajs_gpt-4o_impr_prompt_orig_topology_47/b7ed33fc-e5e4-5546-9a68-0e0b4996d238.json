Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends solving both types of Sudoku puzzles and then determine how many bottles of water he drinks during that time. This is a straightforward calculation, so we can use a direct Python solution.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Determine the duration it takes to solve each type of Sudoku:\n   - A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 30 minutes.\n   - An extreme Sudoku takes 3 times the time of a normal Sudoku, which equals \\(3 \\times 30\\) minutes.\n\n2. Calculate the total time spent:\n   - Total time = time for one normal Sudoku + time for one extreme Sudoku.\n\n3. Determine the number of bottles John drinks.\n   - He drinks 1 bottle every 30 minutes.\n   - Divide the total time by 30 to determine how many bottles of water he drinks.\n\nLet's implement this solution in Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total time spent solving both Sudoku puzzles\ntime_normal_sudoku = 30  # minutes\ntime_extreme_sudoku = 3 * time_normal_sudoku  # 3 times the normal Sudoku time\n\ntotal_time = time_normal_sudoku + time_extreme_sudoku\n\n# Calculate the number of bottles of water drank\n# John drinks one bottle every 30 minutes\nbottles_of_water = total_time // 30\n\n# Print the result\nprint(bottles_of_water)\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, we can determine the number of bottles of water John drinks.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Time for normal Sudoku: 30 minutes.\n2. Time for extreme Sudoku: \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) minutes.\n3. Total time spent on Sudoku: \\(30 + 90 = 120\\) minutes.\n4. Number of 30-minute intervals in 120 minutes: \\(120 \\div 30 = 4\\).\n\nThis matches our calculation from the program. Therefore, John drinks \\(\\boxed{4}\\) bottles of water."
