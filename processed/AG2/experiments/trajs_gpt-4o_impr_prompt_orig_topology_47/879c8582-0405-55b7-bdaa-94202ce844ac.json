Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has, determine how many of these she keeps, and then find out how many students receive cards, considering that each student receives 10 cards.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cards Miss Maria Has:**\n   - Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, with each deck containing 25 cards.\n   - She has 5 boxes of baseball cards, with each box containing 40 cards.\n   - She has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.\n\n2. **Calculate How Many Cards Miss Maria Keeps:**\n   - Miss Maria keeps a total of 50 cards.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Cards Miss Maria Gives Away:**\n   - Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps from the total number of cards she has.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Students:**\n   - Each student receives 10 cards. We need to find the number of students based on the number of cards given away.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Calculate total number of cards Miss Maria has\nbasketball_decks = 6\ncards_per_basketball_deck = 25\nbaseball_boxes = 5\ncards_per_baseball_box = 40\nsoccer_cards = 30\n\ntotal_basketball_cards = basketball_decks * cards_per_basketball_deck\ntotal_baseball_cards = baseball_boxes * cards_per_baseball_box\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards + soccer_cards\n\n# Miss Maria keeps 50 cards\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Calculate the remaining cards that Miss Maria gives to students\ncards_given = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Each student gets 10 cards. Set up the equation to find number of students.\ncards_per_student = 10\nstudents = symbols('students')\nequation = Eq(students * cards_per_student, cards_given)\n\n# Solve for the number of students\nnumber_of_students = solve(equation, students)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Number of students Miss Maria has: {number_of_students}\")\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Calculate Total Cards:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total basketball cards} = 6 \\times 25 = 150\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total baseball cards} = 5 \\times 40 = 200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cards (including soccer cards)} = 150 + 200 + 30 = 380\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Cards Miss Maria Gives Away:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cards given away} = 380 - 50 = 330\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Number of Students:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{330}{10} = 33\n   \\]\n\nAfter performing the above calculations, we can confirm that Miss Maria gives away 330 cards and, by dividing this number by 10 (cards per student), we find that she has 33 students.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{33}\\)."
