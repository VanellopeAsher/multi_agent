      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her and donated $15 to a local charity. How much money does she have left from her earnings?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes, deduct the amounts she gave to her sisters, and her donation to charity, and then determine how much money she has left.\n\nHere's how we can solve the problem, step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the earnings from cookies**: \n   - Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each. \n   - Total earnings from cookies = 80 * 1 = $80.\n\n2. **Calculate the earnings from cupcakes**: \n   - Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each.\n   - Total earnings from cupcakes = 60 * 4 = $240.\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings**:\n   - Total earnings = Earnings from cookies + Earnings from cupcakes = $80 + $240 = $320.\n\n4. **Calculate the total expenses**:\n   - She gave her two sisters $10 each, which totals to $10 + $10 = $20.\n   - She donated $15 to a local charity.\n   - Total expenses = $20 + $15 = $35.\n\n5. **Calculate the money left**:\n   - Money left = Total earnings - Total expenses = $320 - $35 = $285.\n\nNow, let's translate this into Python code using the specified format:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic computation, if needed (not necessary here, but keeping as per instructions)\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Calculate total earnings from cookies\nearnings_cookies = 80 * 1\n\n# Calculate total earnings from cupcakes\nearnings_cupcakes = 60 * 4\n\n# Total earnings\ntotal_earnings = earnings_cookies + earnings_cupcakes\n\n# Calculate total expenses (sisters + charity)\nexpenses = 2 * 10 + 15\n\n# Calculate money left\nmoney_left = total_earnings - expenses\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nLet's verify our calculation in the VERIFICATION section.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Total earnings from cookies = 80 cookies * $1 = $80. ✓\n2. Total earnings from cupcakes = 60 cupcakes * $4 = $240. ✓\n3. Total earnings = $80 + $240 = $320. ✓\n4. Total expenses = $10 (sister 1) + $10 (sister 2) + $15 (charity) = $35. ✓\n5. Money left = $320 - $35 = $285. ✓\n\nEverything checks out correctly. Thus, the money Suzanne has left is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{285} \\]"
