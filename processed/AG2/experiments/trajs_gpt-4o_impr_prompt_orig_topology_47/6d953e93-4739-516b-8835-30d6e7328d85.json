Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's use a direct mathematical approach. We'll calculate the mechanic's earnings for each day and then set up an equation to find out how many car tires were repaired on Friday.\n\n### Breakdown of the Problem:\n\n1. **Thursday's Earnings:**\n   - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.\n   - Price per truck tire = $60\n   - Price per car tire = $40\n   - Total earnings on Thursday: \\(6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40\\)\n\n2. **Friday's Earnings:**\n   - The mechanic repairs an unknown number of car tires (let's denote this number as \\( x \\)).\n   - Total earnings on Friday: \\( x \\times 40 \\)\n\n3. **Difference Between Earnings:**\n   - It is given that Thursday's earnings exceed Friday's earnings by $40.\n   - This gives us the equation:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40 = (x \\times 40) + 40\n     \\]\n\n### Calculation:\n\nLet's solve the equation to find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the unknown variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Thursday earnings\nthursday_earnings = 6 * 60 + 4 * 40\n\n# Friday earnings\nfriday_earnings = x * 40\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(thursday_earnings, friday_earnings + 40)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\ncar_tires_friday = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(car_tires_friday)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify each step:\n1. Calculating the earnings for Thursday:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40 = 360 + 160 = 520\n   \\]\n   Thursday's earnings are $520.\n\n2. Friday's earnings with \\( x \\) car tires:\n   \\[\n   40x\n   \\]\n\n3. Equation for difference:\n   \\[\n   520 = 40x + 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Solving the equation:\n   \\[\n   520 = 40x + 40\n   \\]\n   Subtract 40 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   480 = 40x\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 40:\n   \\[\n   x = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the mechanic repaired \\(\\boxed{12}\\) car tires on Friday."
