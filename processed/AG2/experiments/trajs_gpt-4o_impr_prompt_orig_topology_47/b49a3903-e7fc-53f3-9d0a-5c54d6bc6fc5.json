      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips and decides to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips. If he can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row and he buys 30 yellow tulips, how many total rows of flowers will he plant?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rows Jackson can plant with the tulips he has, including the rules he set for planting the rows. Let's break down the task:\n\n1. Calculate the number of rows possible given the number of tulips Jackson has.\n2. Include additional rows for yellow tulips as per the condition.\n3. Sum up all the rows to get the total number of rows.\n\nWe'll calculate each type of row separately:\n\n- **Red Tulip Rows**: Jackson can fit 6 red tulips per row and has 36 red tulips.\n- **Blue Tulip Rows**: Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips per row and has 24 blue tulips.\n- **Yellow Tulip Rows**: Jackson wants a row of yellow tulips between every red and blue row. He can fit 5 yellow tulips per row and has 30 yellow tulips.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using Python to ensure precision:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Integer\n\n# Calculate the number of rows for red tulips\nred_tulips = Integer(36)\nred_per_row = Integer(6)\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_per_row\n\n# Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips\nblue_tulips = Integer(24)\nblue_per_row = Integer(8)\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_per_row\n\n# Include yellow rows - one between each red and blue row\nyellow_rows_between = red_rows + blue_rows - 1  # As each complete section gets one yellow row after\n\n# Calculate how many yellow rows he can actually have with given yellow tulips\nyellow_tulips = Integer(30)\nyellow_per_row = Integer(5)\nyellow_rows_total = yellow_tulips // yellow_per_row\n\nyellow_rows = min(yellow_rows_total, yellow_rows_between)\n\n# Total rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\n# Output the total rows\nprint(f\"Total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant: {total_rows}\")\n```\n\n### Execution and Verification\n\n1. **Verifying Red Rows**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\text{ red rows}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verifying Blue Rows**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\text{ blue rows}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Yellow Rows**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yellow rows needed} = 6 (red\\ rows) + 3 (blue\\ rows) - 1 = 8\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Possible yellow rows with given tulips} = \\frac{30}{5} = 6\n   \\]\n\n   Since Jackson can have a maximum of 6 yellow rows, the actual number is limited by the available tulips, resulting in 6 yellow rows.\n\n4. **Total Row Count**:\n   \\[\n   6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 6 (yellow) = 15 \\text{ total rows}\n   \\]\n\nJackson will plant a total of \\(\\boxed{15}\\) rows of flowers."
