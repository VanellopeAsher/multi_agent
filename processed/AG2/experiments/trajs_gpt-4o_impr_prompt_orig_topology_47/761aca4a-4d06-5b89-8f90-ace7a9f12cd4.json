Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Monday, a water tank measured 17 feet deep. The following day, the water level rose by an additional 7 feet. By Wednesday, the water level had decreased to two thirds of Tuesday's depth. How deep is the water in the tank on Wednesday?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the changes in the water level over the days:\n\n1. On Monday, the water depth is 17 feet.\n2. On Tuesday, the water level rises by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is \\( 17 + 7 = 24 \\) feet.\n3. By Wednesday, the water level decreases to two thirds of Tuesday's depth.\n\nLet's calculate the depth on Wednesday. We will use Python to compute the depth using fractions to keep it accurate and stick to the problem's requirement of not using decimals.\n\nHere is the Python code using the `sympy` library:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Depth on Monday\ndepth_monday = 17  # feet\n\n# Change on Tuesday\nincrease_tuesday = 7  # feet\ndepth_tuesday = depth_monday + increase_tuesday\n\n# On Wednesday, the depth is two thirds of Tuesday's depth\ndepth_wednesday = Rational(2, 3) * depth_tuesday\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Depth on Wednesday:\", depth_wednesday, \"feet\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- First, we calculate the depth on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to the Monday's depth.\n- Then, we find the Wednesday depth as two thirds of the Tuesday depth using `Rational` to ensure the result is in fraction form as desired.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. Monday's depth: 17 feet.\n2. Tuesday's depth: \\(17 + 7 = 24\\) feet.\n3. Wednesday's depth as two thirds of Tuesday: \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = 16\\) feet.\n\nThe calculations conform with the described changes in water depth. \n\nThus, the water depth on Wednesday is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) feet."
