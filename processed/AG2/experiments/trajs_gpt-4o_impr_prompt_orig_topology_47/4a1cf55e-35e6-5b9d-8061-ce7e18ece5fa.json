Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5.5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a direct Python solution with a structured approach to ensure clarity. We'll break down the problem as follows:\n\n**Step 1:** Understand the prices based on the given information.\n- A gallon jar costs $5.5.\n- A gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar.\n- We can find the cost of a half-gallon jar using the relationship between the gallon jar and the half-gallon jar.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the total cost for Cecelia's purchase.\n- Calculate the total for 10-gallon jars.\n- Calculate the total for 16 half-gallon jars.\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the overall expenditure.\n\nLet's implement this step by step using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Given\ngallon_cost = 5.5\ncost_difference = 2.5\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar\nhalf_gallon_cost_symbol = symbols('half_gallon_cost')\nequation = Eq(gallon_cost, half_gallon_cost_symbol + cost_difference)\nhalf_gallon_cost = solve(equation, half_gallon_cost_symbol)[0]\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total cost\ngallon_jars = 10\nhalf_gallon_jars = 16\n\ntotal_gallon_cost = gallon_cost * gallon_jars\ntotal_half_gallon_cost = half_gallon_cost * half_gallon_jars\ntotal_cost = total_gallon_cost + total_half_gallon_cost\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n1. Verify the calculated cost of half-gallon jar: \n   - Gallon jar is $5.5, which is $2.5 more than half-gallon jar.\n   - Therefore, half-gallon jar should be $5.5 - $2.5 = $3.0.\n2. Verify the total calculation:\n   - Total for 10 gallon jars = 10 * $5.5 = $55\n   - Total for 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3.0 = $48\n   - Total cost = $55 + $48 = $103\n\nThus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is \\( \\boxed{103} \\)."
