Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's use a combination of reasoning and algebraic calculation.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach: Case 1 - Direct Python Solution\n\n#### Key Idea:\nWe need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored, based on the information provided about Richie. Richie scored 90 goals, which is 30 more than Mark and 55 more than Anna. We can set up equations to solve for the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Let \\( R \\) represent the number of goals Richie scored. According to the problem, \\( R = 90 \\).\n2. Let \\( M \\) represent the number of goals Mark scored.\n3. Let \\( A \\) represent the number of goals Anna scored.\n4. According to the problem, Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark. Therefore, \\( R = M + 30 \\).\n5. Richie also scored 55 more goals than Anna. Therefore, \\( R = A + 55 \\).\n6. Use the values of \\( R \\) to find \\( M \\) and \\( A \\).\n\nLet's proceed to translate this into a Python code using the `sympy` library for symbolic computation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\n# Define the variables\nR, M, A = symbols('R M A')\n\n# Given that Richie scored 90 goals\nR_value = 90\n\n# Equation 1: R = M + 30\neq1 = Eq(R, M + 30)\n\n# Equation 2: R = A + 55\neq2 = Eq(R, A + 55)\n\n# Solve for M and A\nM_value = solve(eq1.subs(R, R_value), M)[0]\nA_value = solve(eq2.subs(R, R_value), A)[0]\n\n# Total goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna\ntotal_goals = R_value + M_value + A_value\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"Mark scored: {M_value} goals\")\nprint(f\"Anna scored: {A_value} goals\")\nprint(f\"Total goals scored by all three: {total_goals}\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute how many goals each teenager scored and their combined total.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. Verify Richie’s score consistency with Mark's: \\( R = M + 30 \\rightarrow 90 = M + 30 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( M \\): \\( M = 90 - 30 = 60 \\).\n2. Verify Richie’s score consistency with Anna's: \\( R = A + 55 \\rightarrow 90 = A + 55 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( A \\): \\( A = 90 - 55 = 35 \\).\n3. Total goals calculation: \\( 90 \\) (Richie) + \\( 60 \\) (Mark) + \\( 35 \\) (Anna) = \\( 185 \\) goals.\n\nThe calculations are verified as correct.\n\nFinal result: \\(\\boxed{185}\\) goals scored in total by all three teenagers."
