Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. During his recovery, he managed to regain 5 pounds per month for 2 months. If his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight before he fell ill?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the changes in Mark's weight over time:\n\n1. **Weight Loss**: For the first 3 months, Mark loses 10 pounds per month.\n2. **Weight Gain**: For the next 2 months during recovery, he gains 5 pounds per month.\n3. **Final Weight**: After these changes, his weight is 70 pounds.\n\nThe goal is to determine Mark's initial weight before he became unwell.\n\nLet's model this situation mathematically:\n- Let \\( W \\) be Mark's initial weight.\n- After 3 months of losing weight: \\( W - 3 \\times 10 \\) (since he loses 10 pounds each month for 3 months).\n- After 2 months of gaining weight: \\( (W - 3 \\times 10) + 2 \\times 5 \\) (since he gains 5 pounds each month for 2 months).\n\nGiven that his final weight is 70 pounds, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ (W - 3 \\times 10) + 2 \\times 5 = 70 \\]\n\nLet's solve it using Python with the sympy library for symbolic computation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nW = symbols('W')\n\n# Equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq((W - 3 * 10) + 2 * 5, 70)\n\n# Solve the equation\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, W)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nNow let's verify how the calculations are done:\n\n1. **Weight Loss**: \\( W - 30 \\) after 3 months. If Mark initially weighed \\( W \\) pounds, after losing 10 pounds per month for 3 months, he would weigh \\( W - 30 \\).\n\n2. **Weight Gain**: \\( W - 30 + 10 \\) after 2 months of gaining back 5 pounds per month. This means \\( W - 20 \\) pounds.\n\n3. **Final Check**: Set \\( W - 20 = 70 \\).\n\n\\[\nW - 20 = 70 \\implies W = 90\n\\]\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Initial: \\( W = 90 \\).\n- After weight loss: \\( 90 - 30 = 60 \\).\n- After weight gain: \\( 60 + 10 = 70 \\).\n\nThe calculations match the problem statement, and thus the solution is verified.\n\nThe initial weight is \\( \\boxed{90} \\)."
