Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Henry knows that to assemble all the toys he will need 4 wheels for each car and 2 wheels for each motorcycle. There are 276 wheels left in a box after Henry assembles all toys.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of wheels used for assembling the toys and then determine how many wheels were initially in the box based on the 276 wheels left after assembling.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nCalculate the total number of wheels used for assembling the cars and motorcycles, then add the remaining wheels to find the initial number of wheels in the box.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Calculate the number of wheels needed for cars: Since each car requires 4 wheels, and there are 57 cars, the total wheels for cars are \\(4 \\times 57\\).\n\n2. Calculate the number of wheels needed for motorcycles: Since each motorcycle requires 2 wheels, and there are 73 motorcycles, the total wheels for motorcycles are \\(2 \\times 73\\).\n\n3. Add the wheels used for cars and motorcycles to get the total wheels used.\n\n4. Add the remaining 276 wheels to find the initial number of wheels in the box.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Calculate wheels for cars and motorcycles\nwheels_for_cars = 4 * 57\nwheels_for_motorcycles = 2 * 73\n\n# Total wheels used for assembling\ntotal_wheels_used = wheels_for_cars + wheels_for_motorcycles\n\n# Remaining wheels in the box\nremaining_wheels = 276\n\n# Initial wheels in the box\ninitial_wheels_in_box = total_wheels_used + remaining_wheels\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The initial number of wheels in the box:\", initial_wheels_in_box)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate the total wheels needed for cars:\n   \\(4 \\times 57 = 228\\)\n\n2. Calculate the total wheels needed for motorcycles:\n   \\(2 \\times 73 = 146\\)\n\n3. Total wheels used:\n   \\(228 + 146 = 374\\)\n\n4. Initial wheels in the box:\n   \\(374 + 276 = 650\\)\n\nMy calculations confirm that the initial number of wheels in the box is \\(\\boxed{650}\\)."
