Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.

      "content": "To determine how many guests would make the costs of the two venues equal, we should set up an equation representing the total costs for each venue. Let's define \\( n \\) as the number of guests:\n\n1. **First Venue:**\n   - Flat fee: $2000\n   - Additional cost per guest for food: $50\n   - Total Cost: \\( 2000 + 50n \\)\n\n2. **Second Venue:**\n   - Cost per guest (including food): $250\n   - Total Cost: \\( 250n \\)\n\nWe want to find the number of guests \\( n \\) such that the costs are equal:\n\n\\[\n2000 + 50n = 250n\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python and the sympy library.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(2000 + 50*n, 250*n)\n\n# Solve the equation\nnumber_of_guests = solve(equation, n)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(number_of_guests[0])\n```\n\nThis code calculates the number of guests necessary for the cost of both venues to be the same.
