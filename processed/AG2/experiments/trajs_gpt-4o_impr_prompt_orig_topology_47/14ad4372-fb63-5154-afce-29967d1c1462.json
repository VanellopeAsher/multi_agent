      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday. On Sundays, she takes a break and doesn't teach any classes. Each class has 15 students. She charges $15.00 per student for each class.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week, then multiply this by the number of students per class and the rate she charges per student. Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process**\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Classes:**\n   - Judy teaches 5 classes every day from Monday to Friday.\n   - Saturday's schedule includes 8 classes.\n   - Sunday's she doesn't teach any classes.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Earnings for One Week:**\n   - Judy charges $15 per student.\n   - Each class has 15 students.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Number of Classes per Week**\n\n- Classes from Monday to Friday: \n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ classes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 25 \\text{ classes}\n  \\]\n\n- Classes on Saturday:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ classes}\n  \\]\n\n- Total Classes in a Week:\n  \\[\n  25 + 8 = 33 \\text{ classes}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Weekly Earnings**\n\n- Students per Class: \n  \\[\n  15 \\text{ students}\n  \\]\n\n- Charge per Student:\n  \\[\n  15 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n- Earnings per Class:\n  \\[\n  15 \\text{ students} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/student} = 225 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n- Total Weekly Earnings:\n  \\[\n  33 \\text{ classes} \\times 225 \\text{ dollars/class} = 7425 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nLet's compile this into a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total weekly earnings\nclasses_per_weekday = 5\nclasses_saturday = 8\nstudents_per_class = 15\ncharge_per_student = 15\n\n# Total classes from Monday to Friday\ntotal_weekdays_classes = classes_per_weekday * 5\n\n# Total classes in a week\ntotal_classes = total_weekdays_classes + classes_saturday\n\n# Earnings per class\nearnings_per_class = students_per_class * charge_per_student\n\n# Total weekly earnings\ntotal_earnings = total_classes * earnings_per_class\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. Confirm calculation of classes:\n   - Monday to Friday: \\( 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\) classes\n   - Saturday: 8 classes\n   - Total: \\( 25 + 8 = 33 \\) classes\n\n2. Confirm total earnings:\n   - Earnings per class: \\( 15 \\times 15 = 225 \\)\n   - Total weekly earnings: \\( 33 \\times 225 = 7425 \\)\n\nThe calculations appear correct, and thus the answer to Judy's weekly earnings is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{7425}\\)"
