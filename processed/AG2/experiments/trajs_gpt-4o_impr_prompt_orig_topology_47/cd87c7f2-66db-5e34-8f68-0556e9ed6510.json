Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 100 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 120 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many balloons were thrown during the water balloon fight. We'll first calculate the total number of balloons and then subtract the number that remained unthrown.\n\nKey Idea:\n- Total balloons initially = 10 packs × 100 balloons/pack.\n- Subtract the number of remaining balloons to find the number of thrown balloons.\n\nHere's the solution using Python and the sympy package:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Total balloons initially\ntotal_balloons = 10 * 100\n\n# Balloons remaining\nballoons_left = 120\n\n# Balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\n# Display the result in integer form\nprint(f\"The number of balloons thrown is {balloons_thrown}.\")\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the solution:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the total initial balloons**:\n   - 10 packs × 100 balloons/pack = 1000 balloons.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of balloons thrown**:\n   - Initial balloons: 1000\n   - Balloons left: 120\n   - Balloons thrown = 1000 - 120 = 880\n\nThe calculations are accurate, and the solution is valid. Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{880} \\]"

I'll continue with the logic and process we've established, verifying each step comprehensively.\n\n1. **Determine Total Initial Balloons**:\n   We start by calculating the total number of balloons at the beginning of the activity:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Initial Balloons} = 10 \\text{ packs} \\times 100 \\text{ balloons per pack} = 1000 \\text{ balloons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Balloons Thrown**:\n   To find the number of balloons that were thrown, we subtract the number of remaining balloons from the total initial balloons:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Thrown} = 1000 \\text{ (total balloons)} - 120 \\text{ (remaining balloons)} = 880 \\text{ balloons}\n   \\]\n\nVerification:\n- Initial calculation of total balloons (10 packs of 100 balloons each) gives 1000.\n- Subtracting 120 (the leftover balloons) from 1000 leads us to 880.\n\nThus, after following the steps and verifying each part of the process, the final result is confirmed as correct:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{880} \\]"
