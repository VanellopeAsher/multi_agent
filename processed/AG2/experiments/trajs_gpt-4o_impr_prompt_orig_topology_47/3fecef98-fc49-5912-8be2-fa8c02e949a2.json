Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. He also wants to make a duvet cover, 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.

      "content": "Let's solve this problem step-by-step using Python and the `sympy` library for precise calculations.\n\n### Key Idea:\nJim is making two pieces of fabric larger than his bed and a duvet cover. We'll calculate the area of fabric needed for each part separately and sum them up.\n\n1. Calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric for the bed.\n   - The bed is originally 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.\n   - Each fabric piece must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed dimensions.\n\n2. Calculate the area of each piece of fabric for the bed.\n\n3. Calculate the area of the duvet cover.\n\n4. Sum up all the areas to get the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy.\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Dimensions for the bed\nbed_length = 6\nbed_width = 8\n\n# Increase the dimensions for the fabric\nfabric_length = bed_length + 2\nfabric_width = bed_width + 2\n\n# Calculate the area for one piece of fabric (Jim needs two such pieces)\nfabric_area = fabric_length * fabric_width\n\n# Calculate the total area for the two pieces of fabric\ntotal_fabric_area_for_bed = 2 * fabric_area\n\n# Duvet cover dimensions\nduvet_length = 9\nduvet_width = 11\n\n# Calculate the area for the duvet cover\nduvet_area = duvet_length * duvet_width\n\n# Calculate the total fabric needed\ntotal_fabric_area = total_fabric_area_for_bed + duvet_area\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The total fabric needed is {total_fabric_area} square feet.\")\n```\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Calculate the dimensions of the fabric for the bed:**\n   - Fabric length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet\n   - Fabric width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet\n\n2. **Area for one piece:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Fabric area} = 8 \\times 10 = 80 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total area for two pieces:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fabric area for bed} = 2 \\times 80 = 160 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Duvet cover area:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Duvet area} = 9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total fabric needed:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fabric area} = 160 + 99 = 259 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nAfter double-checking each step, the calculations are consistent and correct. \n\nTherefore, Jim needs 259 square feet of fabric.\n\n\\[\\boxed{259}\\]"
