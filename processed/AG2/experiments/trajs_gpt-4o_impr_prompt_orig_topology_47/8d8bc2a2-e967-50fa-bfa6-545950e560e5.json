Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGeorge needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000.5. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's follow Case 1: Direct Python Solution, as this involves straightforward arithmetic calculations to determine the total cost and the number of hours George needs to work.\n\n### Key Idea:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work.\n2. Subtract the deposit from the total cost.\n3. Determine the number of hours George needs to work at his hourly rate to cover the remaining balance.\n\nNow, here is the structured solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, ceiling\n\n# Define costs using Rational to avoid decimal approximations\nbase_cost_per_implant = Rational(2000.5)\nporcelain_crown_cost = Rational(500.5)\ndeposit = Rational(600)\nhourly_wage = Rational(15.3)\n\n# Total cost for two implants, one of which has an additional porcelain crown\ntotal_cost = 2 * base_cost_per_implant + porcelain_crown_cost\n\n# Remaining balance after the deposit\nremaining_balance = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Calculate the number of hours needed to cover the remaining balance\nhours_needed = ceiling(remaining_balance / hourly_wage)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(hours_needed)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost**: \n   - Base cost for 2 implants: \\(2 \\times 2000.5 = 4001\\)\n   - Additional cost for porcelain crown: \\(500.5\\)\n   - Total cost: \\(4001 + 500.5 = 4501.5\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the deposit**: \n   - Remaining balance: \\(4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5\\)\n\n3. **Calculate hours**: \n   - \\( \\text{hours needed} = \\lceil \\frac{3901.5}{15.3} \\rceil \\approx \\lceil 254.2484 \\rceil = 255 \\)\n\nThis solution confirms our calculations are correct. Based on our step-by-step breakdown, George needs to work **255 hours** to pay for his dental work, given the provided costs and his hourly wage.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{255}\\)."
