      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMartha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 12 families with 6 people and 15 families with 4 people. 16 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a step-by-step mathematical approach to determine the number of people who actually attend Martha's Christmas party.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Invited People\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many people were originally invited to the party.\n\n- **Families with 6 people**: 12 families, each with 6 people.\n- **Families with 4 people**: 15 families, each with 4 people.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of people invited:\n\n- People from 12 families with 6 members each: `12 families * 6 people/family`\n- People from 15 families with 4 members each: `15 families * 4 people/family`\n\nSo, the total number of invited people is:  \n\\[ \\text{Total Invited} = (12 \\times 6) + (15 \\times 4) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of People Who Couldn't Attend\n\nNext, we need to account for the people who couldn't attend:\n\n- 16 people couldn't come due to illness.\n- \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of these 16 people had prior commitments.\n\nLet's calculate the number of people who couldn't attend due to prior commitments:\n\\[ \\text{Prior Commitments} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of people who couldn't attend due to illness and prior commitments is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Missing} = 16 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of People Who Show Up\n\nFinally, subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total invited to find out how many actually show up:\n\\[ \\text{People Showing Up} = \\text{Total Invited} - \\text{Total Missing} \\]\n\nLet's perform these calculations in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate total invited\ntotal_invited = (12 * 6) + (15 * 4)\n\n# Calculate total missing\npeople_ill = 16\nprior_commitments = Rational(1, 4) * people_ill\ntotal_missing = people_ill + prior_commitments\n\n# Calculate people showing up\npeople_showing_up = total_invited - total_missing\n\nprint(people_showing_up)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Total Invited**: \n   \\[\n   (12 \\times 6) + (15 \\times 4) = 72 + 60 = 132\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Missing**:\n   \\[\n   16 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 16 + 4 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **People Showing Up**:\n   \\[\n   132 - 20 = 112\n   \\]\n\nAfter verifying each step, we can confidently conclude that the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \\(\\boxed{112}\\)."
