      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera. Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera after the allowance and the money from selling picture.

      "content": "To find the total cost of the camera, we need to add up the amount Jayden already has with the additional amount he needs.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the total amount Jayden has.\n- Jayden has $70 from selling pictures.\n- Ava gave Jayden half of her $90 allowance, which is \\(\\frac{90}{2} = 45\\).\n\nThus, the total amount Jayden has is:\n\\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Determine how much more Jayden needs.\n- Jayden needs $85 more.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the total price of the camera.\n- The total cost of the camera is the amount Jayden already has plus the additional amount he needs:\n\\[ 115 + 85 = 200 \\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation:\n\n**Verification:**\n1. Jayden has $70 + \\$45 = \\$115$.\n2. He needs $85 more dollars.\n3. Therefore, the camera costs \\(115 + 85 = 200\\).\n\nEverything checks out. Thus, the total cost of the camera is \\(\\boxed{200}\\)."
