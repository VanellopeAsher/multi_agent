      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it. They are red, white, purple, and yellow.   Half the mural is yellow. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, calculate how many pints of red paint was used."

      "content": "Let's solve the problem using a step-by-step approach:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe know:\n\n- Total paint used: 12 pints.\n- Half of the mural is yellow, so yellow paint = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) pints.\n- The remaining paint (6 pints) is equally divided among red, white, and purple.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Paint Used for Each of Red, White, and Purple**\n\nSince the remaining 6 pints are divided equally among three colors (red, white, and purple), we can calculate the amount of red paint used:\n\n- Remaining paint for red, white, and purple = 6 pints.\n- Amount of paint for each color = \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints.\n\nThus, 2 pints of red paint were used.\n\n**Step 3: Verification**\n\nVerify if the calculated amounts add up to the total paint used:\n- Yellow paint: 6 pints\n- Red paint: 2 pints\n- White paint: 2 pints\n- Purple paint: 2 pints\n- Total = 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 pints\n\nThis adds up to the total amount of paint used, confirming our solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of pints of red paint used is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
