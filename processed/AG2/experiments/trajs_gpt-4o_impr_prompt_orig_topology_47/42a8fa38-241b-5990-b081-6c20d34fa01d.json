Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDuring the month of April, Mrs. Rylan has been actively preparing her farm for the growing season by planting a variety of vegetables. She purchased 20 tomato seed packets and 80 celery seed packets for this purpose.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we simply need to calculate the total cost of the seed packets by multiplying the quantity of each type of seed packet by its respective price, and then summing these products.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Cost of Each Type of Seed Packet**:\n   - The cost of 20 tomato seed packets at $40 each.\n   - The cost of 80 celery seed packets at $30 each.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost**:\n   - Multiply the number of tomato seed packets by the price of one packet.\n   - Multiply the number of celery seed packets by the price of one packet.\n   - Add these two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of seed packets Mrs. Rylan purchased\ntomato_seed_packets = 20\ncelery_seed_packets = 80\n\n# Cost per seed packet\ncost_per_tomato_packet = 40\ncost_per_celery_packet = 30\n\n# Calculate total cost for each type of seed packet\ntotal_cost_tomato = tomato_seed_packets * cost_per_tomato_packet\ntotal_cost_celery = celery_seed_packets * cost_per_celery_packet\n\n# Calculate total cost for all seed packets\ntotal_cost = total_cost_tomato + total_cost_celery\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify the steps and calculations:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate Total Cost for Tomato Seed Packets**:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ packets} \\times \\$40/\\text{packet} = \\$800\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost for Celery Seed Packets**:\n   \\[\n   80 \\text{ packets} \\times \\$30/\\text{packet} = \\$2400\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add Both Costs**:\n   \\[\n   \\$800 + \\$2400 = \\$3200\n   \\]\n\nThis matches our Python calculation. Hence, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on purchasing the seeds is \\(\\boxed{3200}\\)."
