      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20.5 feet on the long side and 15.5 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?"

      "content": "To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\]\n\nwhere the length is 20.5 feet and the width is 15.5 feet.\n\nWe'll use Python and the sympy library to compute the answer using fractions for precision.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the length and width as Rational numbers\nlength = Rational(205, 10)  # 20.5 feet\nwidth = Rational(155, 10)   # 15.5 feet\n\n# Calculate the perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nNow, let's go through the verification process.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Break Down Components:**\n   - Length: \\( 20.5 \\) feet\n   - Width: \\( 15.5 \\) feet\n\n2. **Sum the Length and Width:**\n   \\[ 20.5 + 15.5 = 36 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Perimeter:**\n   \\[ 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n4. **Confirmation:**\n   Using the Python `sympy` code, the calculation should correctly handle any potential precision issues, ensuring the accuracy of our final count in feet.\n\nTherefore, James needs to buy a total of \\(\\boxed{72}\\) feet of crepe paper to cover the entire perimeter of the fence."
