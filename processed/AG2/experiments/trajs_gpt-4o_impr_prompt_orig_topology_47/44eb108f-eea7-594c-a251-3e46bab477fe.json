Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces certain inches long. At last she obtains 8 pieces, then how many inches was each piece?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the original length of the wire and the resulting pieces. We can follow the Case 1: Direct Python Solution approach since this problem involves straightforward arithmetic calculations.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Convert Units**: First, we convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches, since the problem ultimately involves finding the length of each piece in inches.\n2. **Calculate Length of Each Piece**: Given that the wire is divided into 8 equal pieces, we need to determine the length of each piece in inches.\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. **Conversion**: \n   - 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.\n   - Therefore, 4 feet is equal to \\(4 \\times 12\\) inches.\n\n2. **Length of Each Piece**:\n   - Divide the total number of inches by the number of pieces to find the length of each piece.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define total length of the wire in feet\nlength_ft = 4\n\n# Convert the length to inches\ntotal_length_in = length_ft * 12\n\n# Number of pieces the wire is cut into\nnum_pieces = 8\n\n# Calculate the length of each piece\nlength_per_piece = total_length_in / num_pieces\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Length of each piece: {length_per_piece} inches\")\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, we can determine the length of each piece.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Unit Conversion Check**: Ensure that 4 feet correctly converts to inches:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ feet} = 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculation Check**: The number of pieces is 8. If each piece is \\(48 \\div 8 = 6\\) inches long, then \\(8 \\times 6 = 48\\), which matches the original total length in inches.\n\nGiven that each step is verified and the calculations are accurate, the final solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each piece of wire is 6 inches long."

The length should be expressed as an integer, rather than a decimal, since we're dealing with whole pieces of wire.\n\nTherefore, the length of each piece should be represented simply and exactly as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\nEach piece of wire is 6 inches long."
