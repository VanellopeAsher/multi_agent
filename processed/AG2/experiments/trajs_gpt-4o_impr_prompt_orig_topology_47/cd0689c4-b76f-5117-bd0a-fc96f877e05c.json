Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows. She has 6 presents for her family members, 4 presents for her buddies, and 2 presents for her educators. She possesses 144 inches of ribbon for this task. What is the length in inches of ribbon that she can allocate for each present's bow?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ribbon Monica can allocate to each present's bow, given a total ribbon supply and the total number of presents. Let's break down the steps needed to solve this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Presents:**\n   - Monica has 6 presents for her family, 4 presents for her buddies, and 2 presents for her educators.\n   - Thus, the total number of presents is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total presents} = 6 + 4 + 2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Amount of Ribbon per Present:**\n   - Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.\n   - We need to divide this ribbon equally among all the presents.\n   - The amount of ribbon per present is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ribbon per present} = \\frac{144}{\\text{Total presents}}\n     \\]\n\n### Python Code for Calculation\nLet's use Python to compute the number of inches of ribbon that can be allocated to each present:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Total number of presents\ntotal_family_presents = 6\ntotal_friends_presents = 4\ntotal_teachers_presents = 2\ntotal_presents = total_family_presents + total_friends_presents + total_teachers_presents\n\n# Total inches of ribbon\ntotal_ribbon = 144\n\n# Calculate ribbon per present\nribbon_per_present = Rational(total_ribbon, total_presents)\nprint(\"Ribbon per present:\", ribbon_per_present)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\nLet's verify our calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate total presents:\n   \\[\n   6 + 4 + 2 = 12\n   \\]\n   \n2. Calculate ribbon per present:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{144}{12} = 12\n   \\]\n\nBoth calculations match correctly. We have verified that Monica can allocate 12 inches of ribbon for each present's bow.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe length of ribbon Monica can allocate for each present's bow is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) inches."
