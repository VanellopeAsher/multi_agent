Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money. If Walter's lawyer contributed $6600 in total, how much did his friend give him?"

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we'll use Case 1: Direct Python Solution. The problem involves simple arithmetic to determine how much Walter's friend gave him, based on how much his lawyer contributed.\n\n### Key Idea:\n- Walter's lawyer donated three times the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund.\n- We need to determine how much his friend contributed.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. Calculate the total amount initially collected by Walter from his neighbors and the online fund.\n2. Use the total donation amount from Walter's lawyer and determine the expected contribution amount corresponding to the triple donation premise.\n3. Determine how much was given by Walter's friend.\n\n### Solution Using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Calculate total collected by Walter\nneighbors = 500\nonline_fund = 1500\ntotal_collected_by_walter = neighbors + online_fund\n\n# Step 2: Represent friend's contribution with a variable 'friend_contribution'\nfriend_contribution = symbols('friend_contribution')\n\n# Total collected after friend contributes\ntotal_after_friend = total_collected_by_walter + friend_contribution\n\n# Step 3: Lawyer's contribution is 3 times as much as everyone else\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * total_after_friend\n\n# Given lawyer contributed $6600\n# Form an equation for lawyer's contribution\neq = Eq(lawyer_contribution, 6600)\n\n# Solve for friend's contribution\nfriend_solution = solve(eq, friend_contribution)\n\n# Output the friend's contribution\nprint(friend_solution[0])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Symbols**: Using `sympy.symbols` to define a symbolic representation for the unknown `friend_contribution`.\n- **Equation**: Construct an equation that models the lawyer's donation as being equal to three times the total contributions.\n- **Solve**: Use `solve` from `sympy` to solve for the friend's contribution.\n- **Print**: Output the result using the `print` function to display in the required format.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. Verify the correctness of arithmetic calculations: Ensure the total from neighbors and online fund is calculated correctly: `500 + 1500 = 2000`.\n2. Verify the equation for determining friend's contribution: Ensure the equation is logically formulated such that `lawyer_contribution = 3 * (total_collected_by_walter + friend_contribution)`.\n3. Double-check the solution obtained from solving the equation.\n\nLet's execute this code to ensure accurate results."

So:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \\times (2000 + \\text{friend's contribution})\n  \\]\n- We set up the equation \\( 3(2000 + \\text{friend's contribution}) = 6600 \\).\n- Solving for the friend's contribution, we derived it to be $200.\n\nSince the calculations are consistent and verified, the solution is confirmed:\n\n\\(\\boxed{200}\\)"
