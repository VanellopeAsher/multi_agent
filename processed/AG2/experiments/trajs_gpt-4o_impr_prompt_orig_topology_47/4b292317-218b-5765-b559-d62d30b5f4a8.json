Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 50 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

      "content": "To find the length of each final cut of the ribbon, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. **Total Ribbon Length:**\n   - The total length of the ribbon Marty has is 10,000 millimeters.\n\n2. **First Division:**\n   - Marty cuts the ribbon into 40 equal parts. The length of each of these parts is calculated by dividing the total length of the ribbon by 40.\n\n3. **Second Division:**\n   - Each of these 40 parts is then divided into 50 equal parts. The length of each of these final parts is calculated by dividing the length of each of the 40 parts by 50.\n\nWe'll calculate this using Python with the `sympy` library to handle fractions precisely.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total length of ribbon\ntotal_length_mm = 10000\n\n# Length of one part after first division\nlength_first_cut_mm = Rational(total_length_mm, 40)\n\n# Length of one part after second division\nlength_final_cut_mm = Rational(length_first_cut_mm, 50)\n\n# Output the result in fractional form\nprint(length_final_cut_mm)\n```\n\nThis code will output the length of each final cut. The `Rational` function from `sympy` is used to ensure that the division results are in fraction form for precision.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using the given code.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each of the first 40 parts} = \\frac{10000}{40} = 250 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Division:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each of the 50 parts from one of the first divisions} = \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:** The length of each final cut is indeed 5 mm, as calculated and verified step by step.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
