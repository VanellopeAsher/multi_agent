      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2.5 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Peter spends each day and calculate the number of action figures he purchases within the 7 days, considering the distinct costs of the types of action figures.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Amount Peter Spends Each Day:**\n   - Peter wants to spend an equal amount over the 7 days.\n   - He has a total of $70.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent per day} = \\frac{70}{7} = 10\n   \\]\n\n   So, Peter spends $10 each day.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Action Figures for Sunday through Wednesday:**\n   - On each of these days, Peter buys wooden action figures that cost $5 each.\n   - Days considered: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (4 days).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wooden action figures per day} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wooden figures from Sunday to Wednesday} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Action Figures for Thursday through Saturday:**\n   - On each of these days, Peter purchases plastic action figures that cost $2.5 each.\n   - Days considered: Thursday, Friday, Saturday (3 days).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Plastic action figures per day} = \\frac{10}{2.5} = 4\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total plastic figures from Thursday to Saturday} = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Number of Action Figures:**\n   - Add the total figures from the two periods.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total action figures} = 8 + 12 = 20\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's write the code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational, simplify\n\n# Total money and days\ntotal_money = 70\ntotal_days = 7\n\n# Money spent per day\nmoney_per_day = total_money / total_days\n\n# Costs of action figures\ncost_wooden = 5\ncost_plastic = 2.5\n\n# Days buying wooden and plastic figures\ndays_wooden = 4\ndays_plastic = 3\n\n# Action figures bought each consecutive period\nwooden_figures_per_day = money_per_day / cost_wooden\nplastic_figures_per_day = money_per_day / cost_plastic\n\n# Total action figures\ntotal_wooden_figures = simplify(wooden_figures_per_day * days_wooden)\ntotal_plastic_figures = simplify(plastic_figures_per_day * days_plastic)\n\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\n# Display result\nprint(total_action_figures)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Amount spent per day calculation: $70 total, $10 daily.\n- Action figures calculation:\n  - 2 wooden figures daily for 4 days: \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n  - 4 plastic figures daily for 3 days: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n- Total figures: \\(8 + 12 = 20\\)\n\nAll calculations have been verified step-by-step, and the results consistently check out.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]\n\nThis is the total number of action figures Peter can buy over the week."
