Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost billed by Patty's Plumbing based on their fee structure. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Service Fee**: Patty's Plumbing charges a fixed service fee of $40 for any house call.\n\n2. **Labor Cost**: The labor is charged at $35 per hour or fraction thereof. The job took 2.25 hours to complete. We need to determine the appropriate labor charge:\n   - Since 2.25 is a fraction over 2, it rounds up to 3 whole hours because Patty's charges for every fraction of an hour as if it's a full hour.\n   - Calculate the labor charge for 3 hours.\n\n3. **Cost of Parts**: The job included parts that cost $60.\n\nWe'll sum these three components to find the total bill. Let's implement this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary library\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Service fee\nservice_fee = 40\n\n# Labor rate per hour\nlabor_rate_per_hour = 35\n\n# Labor time in hours (rounded up)\n# Actual time: 2.25, rounded to the next whole number\nlabor_time = 3\n\n# Parts cost\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# Calculate the total labor cost\nlabor_cost = labor_rate_per_hour * labor_time\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(f\"The total amount billed by Patty is ${total_cost}\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. **Service Fee Check**: The service fee is correctly set at $40.\n\n2. **Labor Cost Calculation**:\n   - The job took 2.25 hours. Since Patty's charges for any fraction of an hour as a whole hour, 2.25 rounds up to 3 hours.\n   - Labor for 3 hours: \\(3 \\times 35 = 105\\).\n\n3. **Parts Cost Check**: Parts cost is $60 as given.\n\n4. **Total Cost Calculation**:\n   - Total = Service Fee ($40) + Labor Cost ($105) + Parts Cost ($60) = $205.\n\nAll components check out properly. \n\nThus, the total amount billed by Patty is \\(\\boxed{205}\\)."

Here's a succinct breakdown of the problem-solving process:\n\n1. **Service Fee**: $40 flat fee.\n2. **Labor Cost**:\n   - Time taken: 2.25 hours.\n   - Apply the rule of rounding up any fraction of an hour to the next whole hour.\n   - This means charging for 3 full hours, leading to a labor charge of: \\(3 \\times \\$35 = \\$105\\).\n3. **Parts Cost**: $60.\n\nAdding these costs together:\n\n- Total Bill = Service Fee + Labor Cost + Parts Cost\n- Total Bill = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205\n\nThus, the total amount billed by Patty is \\(\\boxed{205}\\)."
