Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery packet of graham crackers can be used to create the base for 8 big smores. A box contains 3 such packets. If there are 9 children each desiring 2 smores and 6 adults each wanting 1 smore, how many boxes of graham crackers would be necessary?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow the Case 1: Direct Python Solution approach. We first need to determine the total number of s'mores required by both the children and adults. Then, we can calculate how many packets are needed, and finally, how many boxes are necessary.\n\nHere's how we can tackle the problem step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of s'mores desired by the children.\n2. Calculate the total number of s'mores desired by the adults.\n3. Sum the totals from steps 1 and 2 to get the total number of s'mores needed.\n4. Determine how many packets of graham crackers are needed by dividing the total number of s'mores by the number each packet can produce.\n5. Finally, calculate the number of boxes needed based on the packets needed, given that each box contains 3 packets.\n\nLet's implement this plan using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Number of s'mores desired by each child\nsmores_per_child = 2\nnum_children = 9\n\n# Number of s'mores desired by each adult\nsmores_per_adult = 1\nnum_adults = 6\n\n# Total s'mores needed\ntotal_smores = (smores_per_child * num_children) + (smores_per_adult * num_adults)\n\n# S'mores produced by one packet\nsmores_per_packet = 8\n\n# Packets needed\npackets_needed = math.ceil(total_smores / smores_per_packet)\n\n# Number of boxes needed (each box contains 3 packets)\npackets_per_box = 3\nboxes_needed = math.ceil(packets_needed / packets_per_box)\n\n# The number of boxes required\nprint(boxes_needed)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate Total S'mores:**\n   - Children: \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\)\n   - Adults: \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n   - Total S'mores = \\(18 + 6 = 24\\)\n\n2. **Calculate Packets Needed:**\n   - Each packet can make 8 s'mores. \n   - \\( \\lceil \\frac{24}{8} \\rceil = \\lceil 3 \\rceil = 3\\) packets needed.\n\n3. **Calculate Boxes Needed:**\n   - Each box contains 3 packets. \n   - \\( \\lceil \\frac{3}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 1 \\rceil = 1\\) box needed.\n\nThe verification confirms that the calculations are correct. Therefore, we need:\n\n\\(\\boxed{1}\\) box of graham crackers."
