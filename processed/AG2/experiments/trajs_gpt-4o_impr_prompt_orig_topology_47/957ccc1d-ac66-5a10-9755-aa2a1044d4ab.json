Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his weight loss goal, based on the given conditions.\n\n**Key Idea:** \nTo lose weight, Andy needs to burn more calories than he consumes. The relationship given is that burning 3500 calories results in a loss of one pound.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Determine the total pounds Andy wants to lose.\n2. Calculate the total calorie deficit needed using the conversion factor of 3500 calories per pound.\n3. Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.\n4. Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit needed.\n\nLet's calculate each step using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total pounds Andy wants to lose\npounds_to_lose = 30\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total calorie deficit needed\ncalories_per_pound = 3500\ntotal_calorie_deficit = pounds_to_lose * calories_per_pound\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th\ndays_in_january = 31\ndays_in_february = 28  # Ignoring leap year for this problem\ndays_in_march = 31\ndays_in_april = 30\ndays_in_may = 31\ndays_in_june = 30\ndays_until_july_19 = 19\n\ntotal_days = (\n    days_in_january + days_in_february + days_in_march\n    + days_in_april + days_in_may + days_in_june + days_until_july_19\n)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed\ndaily_calorie_deficit = Rational(total_calorie_deficit, total_days)\n\n# Output the result in fraction form\nprint(daily_calorie_deficit)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Check the total pounds Andy needs to lose:**  \n   \\[ \\text{pounds\\_to\\_lose} = 30 \\]\n\n2. **Verify the total calorie deficit:**  \n   \\[ 30 \\times 3500 = 105000 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\n3. **Count days between the dates provided:**  \n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 days\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July till 19th: 19 days  \n   - Total: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days\n\n4. **Check daily calorie deficit calculation:**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{105000}{200} = 525\n   \\]\n\nAfter verification, everything checks out correctly. Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{525} \\]"
