Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $300 every day. He worked for an entire week and spent a total of $1000. How much does he have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll first calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week and then determine how much he has left after his expenditures.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach: Case 1 - Direct Python Solution\n\n1. **Calculate Total Earnings:** Since Gerald earns $300 per day and works for an entire week (7 days), we'll calculate his total earnings for the week.\n   \n2. **Calculate Remaining Amount:** Subtract the amount Gerald spent from his total earnings to find out how much he has left.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate total earnings for the week\ndaily_earnings = 300\ndays_worked = 7\ntotal_earnings = daily_earnings * days_worked\n\n# Calculate the amount spent\namount_spent = 1000\n\n# Calculate the remaining amount after spending\nremaining_amount = total_earnings - amount_spent\n\n# Output the result\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Earnings:**\n   \\[\n   300 \\, \\text{dollars/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 2100 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n   Gerald earned $2100 in total for the week.\n\n2. **Calculate Remaining Amount:**\n   \\[\n   2100 \\, \\text{dollars} - 1000 \\, \\text{dollars} = 1100 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n   After spending $1000, Gerald has $1100 remaining.\n\nThe calculations are correct according to the steps outlined. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1100} \\]"
