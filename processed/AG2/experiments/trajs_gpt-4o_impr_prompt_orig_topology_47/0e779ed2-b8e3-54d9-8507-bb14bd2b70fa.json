      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the ages of the siblings and then sum them up.\n\n### Step-by-step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the age of the sisters:**\n   - The age of each sister is given as 1.6 times ten years.\n   - \\( \\text{Age}_\\text{Sister} = 1.6 \\times 10 = 16 \\) years.\n\n2. **Calculate the age of one of the brothers:**\n   - The younger brother is 3/5 of 20 years old.\n   - \\( \\text{Age}_\\text{Younger Brother} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 = 12 \\) years.\n\n3. **Find the age of the older brother:**\n   - The age of the younger brother is half of the age of the older brother.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\text{Age}_\\text{Older Brother} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\) years.\n\n4. **Calculate the total age of the siblings:**\n   - There are 3 sisters, each aged 16.\n   - Total age of sisters = \\( 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\) years.\n   - Total age of brothers = \\( 12 + 24 = 36 \\) years.\n   - Total age of all siblings = \\( 48 + 36 = 84 \\) years.\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python using the steps outlined:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the age of the sisters\nage_sister = 1.6 * 10\n\n# Calculate the total age of all sisters (3 sisters)\ntotal_age_sisters = 3 * age_sister\n\n# Calculate the age of the younger brother\nage_younger_brother = (3/5) * 20\n\n# Calculate the age of the older brother\nage_older_brother = 2 * age_younger_brother\n\n# Calculate the total age of both brothers\ntotal_age_brothers = age_younger_brother + age_older_brother\n\n# Calculate the total age of all siblings\ntotal_age_siblings = total_age_sisters + total_age_brothers\n\n# Print the total age of all siblings in a fraction form\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\nprint(Fraction(total_age_siblings))\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Sister's Age:** \\( 1.6 \\times 10 = 16 \\). Correct.\n2. **Younger Brother's Age:** \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 = 12 \\). Correct.\n3. **Older Brother's Age:** \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\). Correct.\n4. **Total Sister's Ages:** \\( 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\). Correct.\n5. **Total Brother's Ages:** \\( 12 + 24 = 36 \\). Correct.\n6. **Overall Total:** \\( 48 + 36 = 84 \\). Correct.\n\nSince each calculation is verified to be correct, the total age of all siblings is \\(\\boxed{84}\\)."
