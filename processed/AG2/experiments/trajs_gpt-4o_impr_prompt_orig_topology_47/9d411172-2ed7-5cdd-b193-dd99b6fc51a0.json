Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1.

Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $20 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 12 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total cost, the number of classes attended, and the cost per class.\n\n### Key Concept:\nManny's total cost for Karate is $80. His parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $20. We have 12 total classes available, and we need to determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss while still keeping the cost per class at or below $20.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n1. **Identify Maximum Allowable Cost Per Class:**  \n   With `12` classes, Manny's cost per class must not exceed `20`. We calculate this using the formula:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per class} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Classes Attended}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set Up an Inequality to Find Maximum Missable Classes:**  \n   To ensure Manny's cost per class is $20 or less, we want:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{\\text{Classes Attended}} \\leq 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Inequality:**  \n   Rearrange the inequality to find the number of classes he must attend:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Classes Attended} \\geq \\frac{80}{20} = 4\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, Manny must attend at least 4 classes.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum Missable Classes:**  \n   If there are 12 classes in total, and Manny must attend at least 4, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Classes Missable} = 12 - 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n\n```python\n# Python code to confirm the calculations\ntotal_classes = 12\nmin_classes_attended = 80 // 20\nmax_missable_classes = total_classes - min_classes_attended\nprint(max_missable_classes)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. Calculated that Manny requires a minimum of 4 classes attended to meet the cost condition.\n2. Verified that with 12 total classes, the difference gives 8 as the number of missable classes.\n\nThe maximum number of classes Manny can miss is \\( \\boxed{8} \\)."

To ensure his parents are satisfied, we need the cost per class to not exceed $20.\n\n2. **Classes and Requirement**:  \n   - Total available classes = 12\n   - Manny must attend a minimum number of classes so that the cost per class is $20 or less.\n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - Number of classes Manny must attend: \\( \\frac{80}{20} = 4 \\)\n   - Thus, maximum classes he can miss: \\( 12 - 4 = 8 \\)\n\nNow confirmed:\n- Manny can indeed miss up to \\( \\boxed{8} \\) classes and still be eligible to sign up again according to the parental condition."
