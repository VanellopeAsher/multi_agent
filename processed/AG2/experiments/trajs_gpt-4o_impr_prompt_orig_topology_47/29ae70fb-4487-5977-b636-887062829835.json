Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

Manny also signed up for a painting class that costs $30, but his parents don't care about the cost of this class.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Karate classes Manny can miss while keeping the cost per attended class at or below $10. Given that Manny pays $60 for 10 classes, we can set up the problem as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of classes Manny attends.\n   - The cost per class is \\(\\frac{60}{x}\\).\n   - We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class less than or equal to $10.\n\n2. **Write Inequality:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Inequality:**\n   - Multiply both sides by \\( x \\) (assuming \\( x \\neq 0 \\)):\n     \\[\n     60 \\leq 10x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 10:\n     \\[\n     x \\geq 6\n     \\]\n\n   This tells us Manny must attend at least 6 classes.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Classes He Can Miss:**\n   - If there are 10 classes in total, the number of classes he can miss is:\n     \\[\n     10 - x\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( x \\geq 6 \\), we find:\n     \\[\n     10 - 6 = 4\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Manny can miss a maximum of 4 classes.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- **Check Cost Calculation:**\n  - If Manny attends 6 classes, the cost per class is \\(\\frac{60}{6} = 10\\).\n  - This is the maximum he can miss while still meeting the $10 criterion.\n\nThus, the solution is consistent and verified.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
