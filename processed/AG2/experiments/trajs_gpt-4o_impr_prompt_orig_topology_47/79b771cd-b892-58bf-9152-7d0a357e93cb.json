Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far away from the dragon Polly can stand while still successfully hitting it with the javelin, taking into account the extended throwing distance provided by holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\n### Key Concept:\n1. **Effective Throwing Distance with the Gemstone**: Polly can throw the javelin three times farther when holding the gemstone.\n\n2. **Dragon's Flamethrow Distance**: The dragon can breathe fire up to a distance of 10,000 feet.\n\nWe will calculate Polly's effective throwing range with the gemstone and then determine how far beyond the dragon's fire reach Polly can position herself to successfully hit the dragon.\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Throwing Distance with the Gemstone**:\n   - Without the gemstone, Polly's maximum throw distance is 4,000 feet.\n   - With the gemstone, her maximum throw distance is \\( \\text{3} \\times 4,000 = 12,000 \\) feet.\n\n2. **Determine Safe Distance**:\n   - Polly needs to stand such that she is at her maximum throwing distance (12,000 feet) from the dragon while being outside its fire reach (10,000 feet).\n   - Subtract the fire reach distance from Polly's maximum throw distance to determine how far she can stand from the outer edge of the dragonâ€™s range.\n   - Safe Stand Distance = \\( 12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000 \\) feet.\n\nThus, Polly can stand 2,000 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while still being able to hit the dragon.\n\n### Verification:\n- Without the gemstone, Polly throws 4,000 feet.\n- With the gemstone, Polly's throw is 12,000 feet.\n- Dragon's fire reach is 10,000 feet.\n- Calculation: \\( 12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000 \\) feet.\n- Logic: Polly can throw the javelin while being outside the dragon's flame reach.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2000}\n\\]"
