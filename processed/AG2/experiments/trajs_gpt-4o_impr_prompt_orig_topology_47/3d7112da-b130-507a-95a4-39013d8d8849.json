Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's delineate the steps needed to find out how much time John spent sightseeing based on the given information. This problem falls into Case 1: Direct Python Solution, as we can use arithmetic to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Determine Total Time from Shows**:\n   - John watched 3 shows, each lasting 2.5 hours. Thus, the total time spent watching shows is \\( 3 \\times 2.5 \\) hours.\n   - We know this showtime accounts for 30% of his total time.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Time Spent**:\n   - We can set up an equation to determine the total time (\\( T \\)) John spent based on the fact that 30% of his time is spent watching shows.\n   - Therefore, \\( 0.3T = 3 \\times 2.5 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Sightseeing Time**:\n   - Once we determine the total time \\( T \\), the time spent sightseeing would be 40% of the total time \\( T \\).\n\nLet's implement this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# We import sympy for symbolic computation\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Create a symbol for the total time T\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Total time spent on shows\nshow_time = 3 * 2.5\n\n# Equation for total time based on shows being 30% \nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, show_time)\n\n# Solve for the total time\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate the sightseeing time which is 40% of total time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time\n\n# Print the sightseeing time in a fraction form for accuracy\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprint(Fraction(sightseeing_time).limit_denominator())  # Output the time spent sightseeing as a fraction\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Verification of Total Time**:\n   - Calculate the show-time contribution: \\( 3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\) hours.\n   - Set \\( 0.3T = 7.5 \\), solving for \\( T \\) gives \\( T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} = 25 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Verification of Sightseeing Time**:\n   - Sightseeing time is 40% of total time: \\( 0.4 \\times 25 = 10 \\) hours.\n\nThe calculations hold during verification. Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n"
