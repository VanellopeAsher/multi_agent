Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a direct mathematical approach. We'll calculate the amount of protein John consumes each day and then determine the total for the entire week. \n\nLet's break down the solution as follows:\n\n1. **Calculate Daily Protein Intake**:\n   - Given that a cup of mushrooms weighing 150 grams contains 4 grams of protein, we need to determine how many grams of protein are in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n   - The relationship can be expressed as a proportion: \\( \\frac{4 \\text{ grams of protein}}{150 \\text{ grams}} = \\frac{x \\text{ grams of protein}}{300 \\text{ grams}} \\)\n\n2. **Calculate Weekly Protein Intake**:\n   - Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week) to find the weekly protein intake.\n\nLet's translate this solution into Python code using a direct calculation approach:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the protein in 300 grams of mushrooms using proportion.\n\n# Define given values\nprotein_per_150g = 4  # grams of protein in 150 grams of mushrooms\ngrams_per_day = 300   # grams of mushrooms consumed per day\n\n# Calculate daily protein intake\ndaily_protein = (protein_per_150g / 150) * grams_per_day\n\n# Step 2: Calculate weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein = daily_protein * 7  # 7 days in a week\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weekly_protein)\n```\n\nNow let's verify the calculations step-by-step in the next section.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Daily Protein Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily Protein} = \\frac{4 \\text{ grams}}{150 \\text{ grams}} \\times 300 \\text{ grams} = \\frac{4 \\times 300}{150} = \\frac{1200}{150} = 8 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Weekly Protein Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly Protein} = 8 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 56 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\nThis matches our expectations, confirming the solution is correct.\n\n\\[\\boxed{56}\\]"

      "content": "The final calculation of the weekly protein intake is indeed 56 grams. It seems there was a small misunderstanding; the calculation result is correct, but the print function in the script outputs a floating-point number.\n\nTo adhere strictly to the requirement of using fractions or whole numbers and avoid decimals in the output, I'll modify the print statement to ensure the output is in the right format:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the protein in 300 grams of mushrooms using proportion.\n\n# Define given values\nprotein_per_150g = 4  # grams of protein in 150 grams of mushrooms\ngrams_per_day = 300   # grams of mushrooms consumed per day\n\n# Calculate daily protein intake\ndaily_protein = (protein_per_150g / 150) * grams_per_day\n\n# Step 2: Calculate weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein = daily_protein * 7  # 7 days in a week\n\n# Print the result in the correct format (integer)\nprint(f\"{int(weekly_protein)}\")\n```\n\nThis will ensure the output is purely in numerical form, consistent with the problem requirements.\n\nThus, the final weekly protein intake is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{56}\\]"
