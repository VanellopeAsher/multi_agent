Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 15 years less than ten times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a direct Python solution leveraging algebra to set up an equation and solve for the son's age using the SymPy library.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nLet's denote the son's age as \\( x \\) years. According to the problem statement, Carver's age is given by the expression \\( 10x - 15 \\).\n\nWe know that Carver just turned 45, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 10x - 15 = 45 \\]\n\nWe will then solve this equation for \\( x \\).\n\n**Python Code Solution:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for son's age\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Setup the equation according to the problem\nequation = Eq(10 * x - 15, 45)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nIn this script, we set up the symbolic environment using SymPy to solve for \\( x \\), the son's age. Let's go through the solution process step-by-step to ensure correctness.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Set up the equation correctly**: \n    - Given: Carver's age = \\( 45 \\).\n    - Expression for Carver's age in terms of son's age \\( x \\): \\( 10x - 15 \\).\n    - Equation: \\( 10x - 15 = 45 \\).\n\n2. **Solve the equation**:\n    - Adding 15 to both sides: \\( 10x = 60 \\).\n    - Dividing by 10: \\( x = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Verify solution**:\n    - If son's age \\( x = 6 \\), then Carver's age: \\( 10 \\times 6 - 15 = 45 \\), which is correct.\n\nUpon solving, the son's age is indeed \\( \\boxed{6} \\) years."
