Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16. What will be her age after 4 years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward reasoning approach, as it is a simple age calculation problem.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nLet's model the situation mathematically:\n1. In 12 years, Charmaine will be 16 years old.\n2. We need to find Charmaine's current age and then determine her age 4 years from now.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Since Charmaine will be 16 in 12 years, we can express her current age as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current age of Charmaine} = 16 - 12\n   \\]\n2. Calculate Charmaine's age 4 years from now:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age after 4 years} = \\text{Current age of Charmaine} + 4\n   \\]\n\nLet's perform these calculations step by step.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. Compute Charmaine's current age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current age of Charmaine} = 16 - 12 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute her age after 4 years:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age after 4 years} = 4 + 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\nSince the calculations are straightforward, we can present the final result.\n\n**Verification:**\n1. Confirmed that the calculation \\(\\text{Current age of Charmaine} = 16 - 12\\) yields 4, which correctly represents her current age.\n2. Confirmed that adding 4 to her current age gives us 8, which is consistent with the calculation logic.\n\nThis verification confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n\\(\\boxed{8}\\)\n\nCharmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
