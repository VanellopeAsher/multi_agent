You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Let's walk through the approach once more without using Python:\n\n1. **Total cards calculation:**\n   - Basketball cards: 6 decks with 25 cards each = \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\) cards.\n   - Baseball cards: 5 boxes with 40 cards each = \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\) cards.\n   - Total cards = \\(150 + 200 = 350\\).\n\n2. **Cards Miss Maria decides to keep:**\n   - She keeps 50 cards, so cards remaining for students = \\(350 - 50 = 300\\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of students:**\n   - Each student receives 10 cards.\n   - Number of students = \\(300 \\div 10 = 30\\).\n\nThis shows that the number of students Miss Maria has is indeed \\(\\boxed{30}\\).
