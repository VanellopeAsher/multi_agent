You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia.

This falls under Case 1, where we can directly solve the problem using Python.\n\nHere is how we can break it down:\n\n1. Calculate Kassidy's amount, knowing Aurelia has $150 and Kassidy has \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of Aurelia's amount.\n2. Calculate Rayna's amount, knowing she has $70 more than Kassidy.\n3. Calculate the total money they have together.\n4. Determine the amount each would have if they shared equally.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Amount Aurelia has\naurelia_amount = 150\n\n# Calculate Kassidy's amount: 2/3 of Aurelia's amount\nkassidy_ratio = Rational(2, 3)\nkassidy_amount = kassidy_ratio * aurelia_amount\n\n# Calculate Rayna's amount: $70 more than Kassidy\nrayna_amount = kassidy_amount + 70\n\n# Calculate the total amount they have together\ntotal_amount = aurelia_amount + kassidy_amount + rayna_amount\n\n# Calculate the amount each person would get if shared equally\nshared_amount = total_amount / 3\n\n# Output the results in fractions if applicable\nprint(f\"Kassidy's amount: {kassidy_amount}\")\nprint(f\"Rayna's amount: {rayna_amount}\")\nprint(f\"Aurelia's amount: {aurelia_amount}\")\nprint(f\"Total amount: {total_amount}\")\nprint(f\"Amount each would have: {shared_amount}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount each person initially has and how much each would have if they shared equally."
