You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.

Calculate Jayden's current total amount of money including what he earned and what his sister gave him.\n2. Compute the cost of the camera by adding the extra amount he needs to his current total.\n\nLet's proceed with solving the problem as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the amount Ava gave to Jayden, which is half of her $90 allowance.\n2. Compute Jayden's total money including his earnings and what he received from Ava.\n3. Add the extra $85 needed to find the total cost of the camera.\n\nI'll use Python to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary module\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given values\njayden_earning = 70\nava_allowance = 90\nextra_needed = 85\n\n# Calculate how much Ava gave Jayden\nava_give = ava_allowance / 2\n\n# Total amount Jayden has before needing extra\ntotal_before_extra = jayden_earning + ava_give\n\n# Total cost of the camera\ncamera_cost = total_before_extra + extra_needed\n\n# Output the result using Rational to display it as a fraction if needed (though it's a whole number)\nprint(Rational(camera_cost))\n```\n\nRun this code to find the cost of the camera, which will give you the result."

Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45.\n3. Jayden's total money from earnings and Ava's contribution is $70 + $45 = $115.\n4. Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.\n5. Therefore, the total cost of the camera is $115 + $85 = $200."
