You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pints of red paint were used given the conditions of the mural. We'll use a bit of reasoning and algebra here.\n\nKey Idea: This problem can be solved through reasoning and basic algebra without needing to write a Python program.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We know that the mural uses a total of 12 pints of paint.\n2. Half of this paint is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) pints.\n3. The remaining paint (which is the other half) is equally divided among red, white, and purple. So, the non-yellow part consists of \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\) pints.\n4. Since the red, white, and purple colors are used in equal amounts, we divide these 6 pints equally among the three colors.\n\nLet's perform this step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- Total paint = 12 pints\n- Yellow paint = 6 pints\n- Remaining paint (for red, white, purple) = \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\) pints\n- Each of red, white, and purple paint = \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints\n\nSo, 2 pints of red paint were used.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
