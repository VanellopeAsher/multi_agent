You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16.

Let's solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Find Charmaine's current age.**\n\n   We know that in 12 years, Charmaine will be 16 years old. Therefore, her current age can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current age} = 16 - 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Charmaine's age after 4 years.**\n\n   Once we have Charmaine's current age, we can find her age after 4 years by adding 4 years to her current age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age after 4 years} = \\text{Current age} + 4\n   \\]\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Using sympy for handling numeric calculations symbolically\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Symbolic representation of the ages\ncurrent_age = 16 - 12\nage_after_4_years = current_age + 4\n\nprint(age_after_4_years)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the desired answer for Charmaine's age after 4 years."
