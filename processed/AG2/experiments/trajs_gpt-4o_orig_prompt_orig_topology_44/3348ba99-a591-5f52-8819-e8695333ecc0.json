You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

For the first test:\n   - Total sets of ten questions: 7.5\n   - Completion rate: 0.5 sets per hour\n   - Total time given: 0.8 sets of ten hours\n   - Calculate the number of sets Mark could complete in 0.8 hours at the given rate, then subtract from the total sets to find the incomplete sets.\n\n2. For the second test:\n   - Total sets of ten questions: 10\n   - Completion rate: 0.5 sets per hour\n   - Total time given: 0.6 sets of ten hours\n   - Calculate the number of sets Mark could complete in 0.6 hours at the given rate, then subtract from the total sets to find the incomplete sets.\n\nFinally, sum the incomplete sets from both tests.\n\nThis problem fits Case 1, as it can be solved directly using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# First test\ntotal_sets_first = Fraction(7.5)\nrate = Fraction(0.5)\ntime_first = Fraction(0.8)\n\ncompleted_first = rate * time_first\nincomplete_first = total_sets_first - completed_first\n\n# Second test\ntotal_sets_second = 10\ntime_second = Fraction(0.6)\n\ncompleted_second = rate * time_second\nincomplete_second = total_sets_second - completed_second\n\n# Total incomplete\ntotal_incomplete = incomplete_first + incomplete_second\n\nprint(total_incomplete)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the number of incomplete sets of ten questions for both tests, taking into account the time constraints and completion rate provided."
