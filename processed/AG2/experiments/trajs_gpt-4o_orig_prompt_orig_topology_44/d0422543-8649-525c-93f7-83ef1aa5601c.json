You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.

      "content": "The key idea here is to set up an equation based on the given information and solve for the son's age. This can be directly translated into a Python program that uses symbolic computation to solve for the unknown age.\n\nGiven:\n- Carver's age is 60.\n- Carver's age is 8 years less than twice his son's age.\n\nWe can represent the son's age with a variable, say \\( x \\). Then we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Carver's age} = 2 \\times \\text{Son's age} - 8 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\\[ 60 = 2x - 8 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve this equation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the son's age\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(60, 2*x - 8)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsons_age = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the son's age in the required form\nprint(\"The son's age is:\", sons_age)\n```\n\nYou can run this code to find the son's age. Once you do, the son's age will be outputted."
