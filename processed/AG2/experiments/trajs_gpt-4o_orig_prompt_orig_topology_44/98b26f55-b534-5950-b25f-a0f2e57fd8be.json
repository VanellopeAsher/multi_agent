You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJordan plays video games every day.

Then, we can calculate his earnings based on his hourly rate. Since the problem does not provide specific details about his video game time, we need this information to proceed with the calculation.\n\nLet's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of hours Jordan plays video games per day** (this is the missing detail we need).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of hours he would work in a week**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hours per week} = \\text{Hours per day} \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate his earnings for the week**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings per week} = \\text{Total hours per week} \\times 10\n   \\]\n\nTo proceed, please provide the number of hours Jordan spends playing video games per day, so I can calculate the answer for you."

Let's assume that Jordan plays video games for 3 hours every day. \n\nNow, let's use this assumption to calculate his potential earnings:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours Jordan would work in a week**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hours per week} = 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 21 \\text{ hours/week}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate his earnings for the week**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings per week} = 21 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 210 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \\(\\boxed{210}\\) dollars in one week."
