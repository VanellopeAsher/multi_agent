You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first understand the relationship between the numbers reported by Courtney and Kelly.\n\nKey idea:\n\nKelly claims that Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%. This means that the number Courtney reported was 120% of the actual audience size. Given Kelly claims the actual audience was 40 people, we can use this relationship to find out what Courtney reported.\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Let \\( C \\) be the number of people Courtney reported.\n2. According to Kelly, \\( C \\) is 120% of the actual audience size.\n3. Therefore, \\( C = 1.2 \\times \\) the actual audience size.\n\nGiven the actual audience size is 40 people, we have:\n\n\\[ C = 1.2 \\times 40 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\( C \\).\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nactual_audience = 40\noverstatement_factor = Rational(12, 10)  # 120% is 1.2, thus 12/10 in fractional form\n\n# Calculate the number reported by Courtney\nC = overstatement_factor * actual_audience\n\nprint(C)\n```\n\nNow we can find out Courtney's reported audience size using this code."
