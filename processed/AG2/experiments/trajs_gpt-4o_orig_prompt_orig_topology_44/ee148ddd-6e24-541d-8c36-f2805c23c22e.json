  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time John spent on activities and then calculate the time he spent sightseeing, as it constitutes 40% of his activity time.\n\nKey idea:\n- First, calculate the total activity time by summing up all the time John spent on diverse activities.\n- Then, find the amount of time spent sightseeing, given that it accounts for 40% of his total activity time.\n\nLet's go through the steps to compute this:\n\n1. **Calculate John's Total Activity Time:**\n    - Boating: 6 hours\n    - Swimming: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3 \\) hours\n    - Watching shows: 3 shows Ã— 2 hours each = 6 hours\n\n2. **Sum of Activity Time:**\n    - Total Activity Time = Boating + Swimming + Watching Shows\n\n3. **Determine Sightseeing Time:**\n    - Sightseeing is 40% of the Total Activity Time.\n\nWe can use Python (with the sympy library for precise calculations) to compute these values and format the answer using fractions.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate total activity time\nboating_time = 6  # hours\nswimming_time = 6 / 2  # half of the boating time, in hours\nshows_time = 3 * 2  # 3 shows, 2 hours each\n\n# Total activity time\ntotal_activity_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time\n\n# Sightseeing time is 40% of the total activity time\nsightseeing_percentage = Rational(40, 100)\nsightseeing_time = sightseeing_percentage * total_activity_time\n\n# Print the sightseeing time in fractional hours\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out the exact amount of time John spent sightseeing.\n\n"
