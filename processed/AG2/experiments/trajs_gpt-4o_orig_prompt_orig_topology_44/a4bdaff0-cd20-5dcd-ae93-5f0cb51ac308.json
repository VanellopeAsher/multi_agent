You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays on her debts each month and then determine her total payment over the course of a year. Given that each of her debt payments will be 50% more than the minimum, we can determine this by multiplying the minimum by 1.5 and then summing the outcomes for each type of debt monthly. Finally, multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to get the annual payment.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform these calculations and display the result in a suitable format.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the minimum monthly payments\nstudent_loan_minimum = 3000\ncredit_card_minimum = 2000\nmortgage_minimum = 5000\n\n# Calculate 50% more than the minimum payments\nstudent_loan_payment = Rational(3, 2) * student_loan_minimum\ncredit_card_payment = Rational(3, 2) * credit_card_minimum\nmortgage_payment = Rational(3, 2) * mortgage_minimum\n\n# Calculate the total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate the annual payment\nannual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result\nprint(annual_payment)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will show the total amount Jessica needs to pay for the entire year, expressed using fractions to maintain precision and avoid decimal representation."
