If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, and they have a coupon that offers a 10% discount on the total price after cashback, how much will they pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow Case 1 and write a Python program. We need to calculate the total cost after applying the cashback and then the 10% discount.\n\nThe steps to solve this problem are as follows:\n1. Calculate the initial total cost based on the price per gallon and the number of gallons.\n2. Calculate the total cashback.\n3. Subtract the cashback from the initial total cost.\n4. Apply the 10% discount on the remaining cost after cashback.\n5. Print the final cost.\n\nLet's write the Python code for these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial data\nprice_per_gallon = Rational(3)  # $3.00 per gallon\ngallons = 10\ncashback_per_gallon = Rational(0.20)  # $0.20 cashback per gallon\ndiscount_rate = Rational(0.10)  # 10% discount\n\n# Calculate initial total cost\ninitial_total_cost = price_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Calculate total cashback\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Calculate cost after cashback\ncost_after_cashback = initial_total_cost - total_cashback\n\n# Apply discount\ntotal_cost_after_discount = cost_after_cashback * (1 - discount_rate)\n\n# Print final cost in fractional form\nprint(total_cost_after_discount)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final amount the buyer needs to pay after applying both the cashback and the discount."

Let's express it in a fractional form as requested.\n\nHere is the verification with simplified calculation using Python to keep it in a fractional form:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Values as fractions\nprice_per_gallon = Rational(3)  # $3.00 per gallon\ngallons = 10\ncashback_per_gallon = Rational(1, 5)  # $0.20 per gallon as 1/5\ndiscount_rate = Rational(1, 10)  # 10% as 1/10\n\n# Total initial cost\ninitial_total_cost = price_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Total cashback\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Cost after cashback\ncost_after_cashback = initial_total_cost - total_cashback\n\n# Apply discount\ntotal_cost_after_discount = cost_after_cashback * (1 - discount_rate)\n\n# Print in fractional form\nprint(total_cost_after_discount)\n```\n\nThe simplified result:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{126/5}\n\\]\n\nThis is equivalent to $25.20, which matches our calculated end cost after discounts and cashback."
