You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

We will use Python to do these calculations.\n\n### Steps to Calculate:\n\n1. **Age of the Sisters:**\n   - All sisters are of the same age. Given that their age is \\(1.6\\) times \\(10\\), we can calculate it as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sister's age} = 1.6 \\times 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Age of One Brother:**\n   - One brother is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of \\( 20 \\) years old, calculate as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Younger Brother's age} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Age of the Older Brother:**\n   - The younger brother's age is half the older brother's age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Older Brother's age} = 2 \\times \\text{Younger Brother's age}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Age:**\n   - Calculate the total age by summing up the ages of all the siblings.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve it:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Sister's age\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10\n\n# One brother's age (younger)\nyounger_brother_age = Rational(3, 5) * 20\n\n# Older brother's age\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Total age of all siblings (2 brothers + 3 sisters)\ntotal_age = 3 * sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\n# Print the result\nprint(Rational(total_age))\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the total age of all these siblings.
