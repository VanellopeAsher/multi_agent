On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward approach of calculating Billy's and Sally's hourly wages over time and then determining how much each earns after working specific hours. Let's go through the solution step-by-step and use Python to compute the results.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate Billy's hourly wage after his two raises:\n- Initial rate: $10 per hour.\n- After 2 months, raise of $0.50/hour: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n- On his first anniversary, raise of $1.00/hour: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate Sally's hourly wage after her raise:\n- Starting salary: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n- After two months: $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the total amount earned by both Billy and Sally after working 20 hours at their respective wages.\n\nLet's implement this calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Billy's wage\nbilly_initial_wage = 10\nbilly_first_raise = 0.50\nbilly_second_raise = 1.00\n\nbilly_final_wage = billy_initial_wage + billy_first_raise + billy_second_raise\n\n# Sally's wage\nsally_initial_wage = billy_initial_wage + 0.50\nsally_raise_after_2_months = 0.50\n\nsally_final_wage = sally_initial_wage + sally_raise_after_2_months\n\n# Calculate earnings for 20 hours\nbilly_earnings = 20 * billy_final_wage\nsally_earnings = 20 * sally_final_wage\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Print the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally after they both work for 20 hours.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]\n\nSo, Billy will earn $10 more than Sally."
