You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo girls each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water.

Let's follow the steps below:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of water each girl received.\n2. Calculate the total amount of water given to the two girls.\n3. Subtract the amount of water received by the boy.\n4. Subtract the total amount given to the children from the initial quantity of water to find the remaining amount.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total initial amount of water in liters\ntotal_water = 32\n\n# Each girl gets 1/4 of the total water\nwater_per_girl = Rational(1, 4) * total_water\n\n# There are two girls\ntotal_water_for_girls = 2 * water_per_girl\n\n# The boy receives 8 liters of water\nwater_for_boy = 8\n\n# Calculate the remaining water\nremaining_water = total_water - (total_water_for_girls + water_for_boy)\n\n# Print the remaining amount of water in liter form\nprint(remaining_water)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the remaining liters of water. If you execute this, it will calculate and display the result."
