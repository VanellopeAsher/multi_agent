His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is planning a birthday party and wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the length of the fence to determine how much crepe paper James needs to buy. This problem falls under **Case 1** as it can be solved by elementary calculations using Python.\n\nThe key idea is to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence, which is the complete length of the crepe paper needed. Since the tree is in the middle of the yard and doesn't affect the fence, it doesn't impact our calculations.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle with length \\( l \\) and width \\( w \\) is:\n\n\\[ P = 2(l + w) \\]\n\nLet's compute the perimeter using this formula:\n\n```python\n# Define the dimensions of the rectangle\nlength = 20  # length of the long side in feet\nwidth = 15   # length of the short side in feet\n\n# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Output the results\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the total number of feet of crepe paper James should buy. Let me know if you need anything else."
