You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRaymond initially had $2100.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial amount**: Raymond starts with an initial amount of $2100.\n2. **Savings from allowance**: He saves an additional $1100 from his allowance.\n3. **Spending**: He spends $500 on a comic book and $1900 on a puzzle.\n\nThe key idea here is to calculate the final amount by first adding the savings to the initial amount and then subtracting his expenditures. We'll write a program in Python to perform these calculations.\n\nThe problem can be directly solved using Python, so we can proceed with the calculation as outlined above:\n\n```python\ninitial_amount = 2100\nsaved_amount = 1100\nspent_comic = 500\nspent_puzzle = 1900\n\n# Calculating the final amount left\nfinal_amount = initial_amount + saved_amount - spent_comic - spent_puzzle\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(final_amount)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the amount of money Raymond has left."
