You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.

Let's follow the steps below:\n\n1. Calculate the time taken to solve a normal sudoku.\n2. Calculate the time taken to solve an extreme sudoku.\n3. Sum the two durations to get the total time John spends on both puzzles.\n4. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour, divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Duration for a normal sudoku in minutes\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30\n\n# Duration for an extreme sudoku in minutes\nextreme_sudoku_time = 3 * normal_sudoku_time\n\n# Total time spent in minutes\ntotal_time = normal_sudoku_time + extreme_sudoku_time\n\n# Calculate the number of 30-minute intervals he drinks a bottle of water\nwater_bottles = total_time // 30\n\n# Print the result\nprint(water_bottles)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of bottles of water John drinks during the entire period."
