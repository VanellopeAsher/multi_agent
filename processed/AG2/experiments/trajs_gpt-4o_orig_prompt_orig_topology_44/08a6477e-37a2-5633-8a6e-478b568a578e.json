Define variables:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of bandages used on the first day.\n   - Based on the problem, the number of bandages used on the second day is \\( x - 10 \\).\n   - The number of bandages used on the third day is \\( \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\), as half a pack of bandages is used.\n\n2. Set up the equation:\n   - Initially, there are 19 bandages.\n   - On the first day, they receive 50 bandages, so the total after ordering is \\( 19 + 50 = 69 \\).\n   - On the third day, they receive 2 bulk packs, which is 100 bandages, thus having \\( 69 - x - (x - 10) + 100 - 25 \\).\n   - They have 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\n3. Solve the equation for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve the equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\ninitial_bandages = 19\nfirst_day_order = 50\nthird_day_order_packs = 2\n\n# Total bandages at the start\ntotal_initial = initial_bandages + first_day_order\n\n# Bandages after third day orders\ntotal_after_orders = total_initial - x - (x - 10) + third_day_order_packs * 50 - 25\n\n# Equation with 78 bandages left\nequation = Eq(total_after_orders, 78)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code will solve for \\( x \\), the number of bandages used on the first day. Once we know the solution, this will be our answer.\n\nAfter running the code, the number of bandages used on the first day is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
