You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDerrick has a bakery that makes doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue Derrick makes from selling doughnuts throughout the month of June. The problem statement gives us the price per doughnut, but does not specify the number of doughnuts sold each day. For simplicity, let's assume Derrick sells the same number of doughnuts every day.\n\nWe'll proceed by assuming a hypothetical number of doughnuts sold each day, \\( n \\), and then multiplying by the number of days in June and the price per doughnut to find the total revenue. Let's assume Derrick sells 100 doughnuts each day:\n\nKey Idea:\nWe'll calculate Derrick's total revenue by multiplying the number of doughnuts sold per day, the price per doughnut, and the number of days in June.\n\nSince June has 30 days, the total revenue \\( R \\) would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ R = n \\times \\text{price per doughnut} \\times \\text{number of days in June} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of doughnuts sold per day.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational\n\n# Number of days in June\ndays_in_june = 30\n\n# Price per doughnut\nprice_per_doughnut = 2\n\n# Assume n as the number of doughnuts sold per day\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Total revenue in June\nrevenue = n * price_per_doughnut * days_in_june\n\n# Print result without assigning a specific value to n\nprint(f'Total Revenue for June: {revenue}')\n```\n\nRun this code with the specified assumptions to obtain the formula for total revenue, and then insert a specific value of \\( n \\) to calculate Derrick's income for different scenarios. Adjust \\( n \\) as needed based on possible daily sales if more information becomes available."

Here's a summary of how the formula was derived:\n\n- There are 30 days in June.\n- Each doughnut is sold for $2.\n- The total revenue for June is calculated as: \n\n\\[\nR = n \\times 2 \\times 30 = 60n\n\\]\n\nThus, Derrick's income for June, if he sells all the doughnuts, is \\(\\boxed{60n}\\), where \\( n \\) is the number of doughnuts he sells each day. You can substitute in any specific value of \\( n \\) to find the corresponding revenue."
