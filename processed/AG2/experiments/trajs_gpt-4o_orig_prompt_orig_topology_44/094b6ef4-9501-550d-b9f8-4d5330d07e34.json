You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll start by interpreting the given information. The key idea is straightforward and can be handled with some simple arithmetic.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe are given that the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. We need to find the length of the shark given that each remora is 6 inches long.\n\n### Solution:\nLet's denote the shark's length by \\( S \\). Since there are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long, their combined length is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) inches. According to the problem, this combined length is 10% of the shark's length.\n\nThus, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n0.1 \\times S = 12\n\\]\n\nWe need to solve for \\( S \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the shark's length\nS = symbols('S')\n\n# Equation setup based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(0.1 * S, 12)\n\n# Solve the equation\nshark_length = solve(equation, S)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\nOnce you execute the code above, you will get the shark's length, which is the solution to the problem. The expected result will be \\(\\boxed{120}\\) inches."
