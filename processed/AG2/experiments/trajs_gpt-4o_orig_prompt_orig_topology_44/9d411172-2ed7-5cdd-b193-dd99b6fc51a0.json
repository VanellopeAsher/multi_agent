Let's manually solve this step-by-step to see how many classes Manny can miss while keeping the cost per class at most $20.\n\n1. Determine the condition for the cost per class:\n   - If Manny attends \\( x \\) classes, the cost per class is \\( \\frac{80}{x} \\).\n   - Set the inequality: \\( \\frac{80}{x} \\leq 20 \\).\n\n2. Solve the inequality:\n   - \\( 80 \\leq 20x \\)\n   - \\( x \\geq 4 \\)\n\nThis means Manny must attend at least 4 classes. Therefore, he can miss:\n- \\( 12 - 4 = 8 \\) classes without the cost per class exceeding $20.\n\nWe can calculate this without using any solving methods by plugging this logic directly into the code:\n\n```python\n# Total number of classes\ntotal_classes = 12\n# Minimum number of classes he must attend\nmin_classes_to_attend = 4\n# Calculate the number of classes he can miss\nclasses_missed = total_classes - min_classes_to_attend\n\nprint(classes_missed)\n```\n\nThis program should correctly give the answer.
