You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

The best approach here is Case 1, where we can write a Python program to solve it directly.\n\n### Key Idea\n\n1. Calculate the cost for Tara to buy a number of packs.\n2. Determine the revenue Tara made from selling the bags.\n3. Set up an equation where the revenue minus the cost equals the stated profit of $160.\n4. Solve the equation to find out how many packs Tara bought.\n\nLet's set up the equations:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of 5 canvas bags that Tara bought.\n- The cost of \\( x \\) packs is \\( 4x \\) since each pack costs $4.\n- The total number of bags is \\( 5x \\) because each pack contains 5 bags.\n- The revenue from selling the bags is \\( 8 \\times 5x \\) since each bag is sold for $8.\n- The profit is given as $160, so the equation for profit is:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 5x - 4x = 160 \\]\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this equation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(8 * 5 * x - 4 * x, 160)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f'Tara bought {solution[0]} packs of 5 canvas bags.')\n```\n\nThis program will find the number of packs Tara bought, which is the solution to the problem."

It appears my previous solution was incorrect because the profit calculation wasn't accurately matching the interpretation for integer packs.

If these need more rational oversight, specify assumptions like buying full given packs."

Each pack contains 5 bags, sold at $8 each, that comes to a revenue of \\( 40x \\) (because \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\) per pack).\n3.

Consider double-checking the setup or conditions if meant to comprehend whole numbers like purchasing constraints for tangible products or revising initial setups.\n\nFor an exact integer purchase, Tara should buy whole packs like 5 or 10, making profit approximations best fit, possibly aligning packaging with earnings closely tied. Reinterpretation or hypothesis like adding losses or understanding beyond fractional convention like rounding should alleviate rounding discrepancies.\n\nPlease let me know how you wish to handle it—exploring approximations or potential conditions in full integer considerations, or otherwise needing full unprocessed revisits.concise carefully if necessary given previous potential oversight apparent."
