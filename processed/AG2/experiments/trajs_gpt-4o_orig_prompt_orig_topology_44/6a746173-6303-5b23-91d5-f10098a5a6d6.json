You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

We'll then use this total to determine what the lawyer will donate, which is three times the total contributions of all others.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Importing the sympy library to deal with fractions\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the amounts collected\nneighbors_and_online_fund = 300 + 1200\nfriend_contribution = 120\n\n# Total contributions from everyone else (neighbors, online fund, friend)\ntotal_contributions = neighbors_and_online_fund + friend_contribution\n\n# The lawyer donates three times this total amount\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * total_contributions\n\n# Print the result\nprint(Rational(lawyer_contribution))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the amount that Walter's lawyer will contribute.
