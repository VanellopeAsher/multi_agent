You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party.

      "content": "To determine how many feet of crepe-paper streamers James needs, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The key idea is:\n\nCase 1: This is a straightforward calculation using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times ( \\text{length} + \\text{width} ) \\]\n\nIn this case, the length of the backyard fence is 20.5 feet, and the width is 15.5 feet. Let's use Python to compute this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Dimensions of the rectangle\nlength = Rational(20.5)\nwidth = Rational(15.5)\n\n# Calculate the perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total length of crepe-paper streamers James needs. The output is expressed in the form of fractions or in its simplest form using sympy."
