  "problem": "At the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces. The teacher agreed. Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she sold all her muffin crayons and made $36, how much each muffin crayon sells for?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can directly use Python to calculate the number of muffin crayons Kate can make and determine how much each sells for. This corresponds to Case 1.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of crayons Kate has: Since she has 3 boxes with 64 crayons each, multiply 3 by 64.\n2. Determine the number of muffin crayons: Each muffin uses 8 crayons, so divide the total number of crayons by 8.\n3. Calculate the price of each muffin crayon: She made $36 in total, so divide 36 by the number of muffin crayons.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of crayons Kate has\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# Calculate the number of muffin crayons\nmuffin_crayons = total_crayons // 8\n\n# Calculate the price for each muffin crayon\nprice_per_muffin_crayon = 36 / muffin_crayons\n\n# Output the result using the print function\nprint(price_per_muffin_crayon)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the result of how much each muffin crayon sells for.\n\nSince the query requires us to provide the solution in \\boxed{} format, the answer should be presented as follows:\n\n\\boxed{1}"
