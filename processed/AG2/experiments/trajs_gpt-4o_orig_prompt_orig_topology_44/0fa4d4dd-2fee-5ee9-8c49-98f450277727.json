  "problem": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

Then, we need to determine how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the required amount of money.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.\n2. Calculate how much money Sara has from babysitting and her prior savings.\n3. Calculate how much more money she needs after babysitting.\n4. Determine how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining money.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate total cost of the jacket and shoes\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost_per_pair = 100\ntotal_shoe_cost = 2 * shoe_cost_per_pair\ntotal_cost = jacket_cost + total_shoe_cost\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total money earned from babysitting and initial savings\nearnings_per_babysit = 5\nnumber_of_babysits = 10\nmoney_from_babysitting = earnings_per_babysit * number_of_babysits\ninitial_savings = 100\ntotal_money_after_babysitting = initial_savings + money_from_babysitting\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the additional money needed\nmoney_needed = total_cost - total_money_after_babysitting\n\n# Step 4: Calculate how many times she must mow the lawn\nearnings_per_mow = 10\nmowing_times = (money_needed + earnings_per_mow - 1) // earnings_per_mow  # Use ceiling division to ensure a whole number\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Sara must mow the lawn {mowing_times} times.\")\n```\n\nWe use ceiling division to ensure that if there is any remainder from the division, it rounds up to the next whole number because Sara cannot mow the lawn a fractional number of times. Let's run the code to find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn."
