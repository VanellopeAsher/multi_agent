You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a garage sale, Scarlett discovered a fish tank priced at $10.00.

We will add up the amounts for each type of item she bought.\n\nHere's how we can calculate it using Python:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the fish tank.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the stones.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the coral pieces.\n4. Calculate the total cost of the fish.\n5. Add the cost of the fish food.\n6. Sum all these amounts to get the total.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices\nfish_tank_price = 10.00\nstone_price_per_packet = 2.50\ncoral_price_per_piece = 2.00\nfish_price_each = 0.50\nfish_food_price = 2.00\n\n# Quantities\nnum_stone_packets = 2\nnum_coral_pieces = 3\nnum_fish = 20\n\n# Total costs\ntotal_stone_cost = stone_price_per_packet * num_stone_packets\ntotal_coral_cost = coral_price_per_piece * num_coral_pieces\ntotal_fish_cost = fish_price_each * num_fish\n\n# Total amount spent\ntotal_spent = (\n    Rational(fish_tank_price)  # fish tank price\n    + Rational(total_stone_cost)  # total stone cost\n    + Rational(total_coral_cost)  # total coral cost\n    + Rational(total_fish_cost)  # total fish cost\n    + Rational(fish_food_price)  # fish food price\n)\n\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the total amount Scarlett spent, and it should be displayed in fractions/radical forms if applicable. In this case, since it's dealing with currency, the amount will be an exact decimal represented as a fraction."
