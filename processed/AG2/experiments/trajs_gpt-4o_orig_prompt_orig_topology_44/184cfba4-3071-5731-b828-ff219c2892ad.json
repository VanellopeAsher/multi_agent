You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one.\n3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.\n4. The total earnings from the sales is $1200.\n\nOur goal is to find out how many small stuffed animals she sold.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( x \\): the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n- \\( 2x \\): the number of small stuffed animals sold (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).\n\nFrom the given information, the price of a large stuffed animal is \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\nNow let's set up the equation for the total sales:\n\n\\[\n40 \\times (2x) + 120 \\times x = 1200\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(40 * (2 * x) + 120 * x, 1200)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Calculate the number of small stuffed animals\nnumber_of_small_stuffed_animals = 2 * solution[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_small_stuffed_animals)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code and find the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold."
