On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll first set up the system of equations that describe the sales for each day, and then determine the total earning based on the given prices.\n\nLet's outline our steps:\n\n1. Define variables for the number of boxes sold on Saturday.\n   - Let \\( g_s \\) be the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday (given as 10 boxes).\n   - Let \\( a_s \\) be the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday.\n\n2. Use the problem statement to express the sales on Sunday.\n   - On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more gingerbread boxes than on Saturday: \\( g_s + 5 \\).\n   - He sold 15 apple pies: \\( a_s = 15 \\).\n\n3. The problem gives us sales for Monday explicitly:\n   - 2 boxes of gingerbread: \\( g_m = 2 \\).\n   - 4 boxes of apple pies: \\( a_m = 4 \\).\n\n4. Calculate the total boxes sold for gingerbread and apple pies over the three days.\n\n5. Calculate the total earnings using the price of gingerbread and apple pie.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate the total earning:\n\n```python\n# Define the price for each item\nprice_gingerbread = 6  # dollars\nprice_apple_pie = 15  # dollars\n\n# Boxes sold on Saturday\ng_s = 10\na_s = 15 - 4  # Four fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday\n\n# Boxes sold on Sunday\ng_sun = g_s + 5\na_sun = 15\n\n# Boxes sold on Monday\ng_mon = 2\na_mon = 4\n\n# Total boxes sold over three days\ntotal_gingerbread = g_s + g_sun + g_mon\ntotal_apple_pie = a_s + a_sun + a_mon\n\n# Calculate the total earnings\ntotal_earnings = (total_gingerbread * price_gingerbread) + (total_apple_pie * price_apple_pie)\n\n# Output the total earnings\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the total amount Sunny earned over three days."
