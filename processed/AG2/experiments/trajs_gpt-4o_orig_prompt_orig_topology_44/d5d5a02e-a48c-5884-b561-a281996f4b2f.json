You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define Variables\nLet:\n- \\( e \\) be Emil's current age, which is 21.\n- \\( d \\) be Emil's dad's current age.\n- \\( b \\) be Emil's brother's current age.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate Equations\nAccording to the problem:\n- In 5 years, Emil's age will be \\( e + 5 = 26 \\).\n- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so \\( d + 5 = 2 \\times 26 \\).\n- Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so \\( 26 = 2 \\times (b + 5) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Solve Equations\n1. From the dad's age equation:  \n   \\[\n   d + 5 = 52 \\implies d = 47\n   \\]\n\n2. From the brother's age equation:  \n   \\[\n   26 = 2 \\times (b + 5) \\implies 26 = 2b + 10 \\implies 2b = 16 \\implies b = 8\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Sum\nNow, determine the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:\n\\[ \n\\text{Sum} = d + b = 47 + 8 = 55 \n\\]\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to confirm our calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nd, b = symbols('d b', integer=True)\n\n# Emil's current age\ne = 21\n\n# Equations based on the problem\nequation1 = Eq(d + 5, 2 * (e + 5))\nequation2 = Eq(e + 5, 2 * (b + 5))\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2), (d, b))\n\n# Calculate the sum of dad's and brother's current ages\nsum_ages = solution[d] + solution[b]\n\n# Print result\nprint(sum_ages)\n```\n\nWhen we execute this code, it should confirm that the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is \\(\\boxed{55}\\)."
