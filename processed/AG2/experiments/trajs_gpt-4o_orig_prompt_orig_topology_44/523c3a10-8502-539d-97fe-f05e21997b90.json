Let's clarify and verify the steps to ensure we understand how we arrived at the answer, which remains correct as \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\n### Detailed Calculation and Verification\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of s'mores needed:**\n   - **Children:** There are 9 children, and each child wants 2 s'mores.\n     \\[\n     9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ s'mores}\n     \\]\n   - **Adults:** There are 6 adults, and each adult wants 1 s'more.\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 1 = 6 \\text{ s'mores}\n     \\]\n   - **Total s'mores required:**\n     \\[\n     18 + 6 = 24 \\text{ s'mores}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate packets needed:**\n   - Each packet makes 8 s'mores. We need to find out how many packets are needed for 24 s'mores.\n   \\[\n   \\lceil \\frac{24}{8} \\rceil = \\lceil 3 \\rceil = 3 \\text{ packets}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**\n   - Each box contains 3 packets.\n   - We need 3 packets, therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\lceil \\frac{3}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 1 \\rceil = 1 \\text{ box}\n   \\]\n\nThus, to meet the requirement for 24 s'mores, we need \\(\\boxed{1}\\) box of graham crackers. \n\nThe prior calculation and Python code are accurate, and this confirms that only one box is indeed required. \n\nHere is the Python code once more for re-confirmation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import ceiling\n\n# Calculate total s'mores needed\nchildren_smores = 9 * 2\nadults_smores = 6 * 1\ntotal_smores = children_smores + adults_smores\n\n# Calculate packets needed (each packet serves 8 s'mores)\npackets = ceiling(total_smores / 8)\n\n# Calculate boxes needed (each box contains 3 packets)\nboxes = ceiling(packets / 3)\n\n# Print the number of boxes needed\nprint(boxes)  # Output should be 1\n```\n\nThis formulation properly verifies our calculation, resulting in \\(\\boxed{1}\\) box."

Let me reiterate the solution with a clear summary of the approach without requiring additional calculation, given that my previous responses already provide the validated answer.\n\nWhen breaking down the solution:\n- **Children's requirement:** 9 children want 2 s'mores each, totaling 18 s'mores.\n- **Adults' requirement:** 6 adults want 1 s'more each, adding 6 more s'mores.\n- **Total s'mores needed:** 18 from children + 6 from adults = 24 s'mores.\n\nGiven that:\n- **Each packet of graham crackers forms 8 s'mores.** Therefore, for 24 s'mores, we need:\n  \\[\n  \\lceil \\frac{24}{8} \\rceil = 3 \\text{ packets}\n  \\]\n \nSince:\n- **Each box contains 3 packets,** hence for 3 packets needed:\n  \\[\n  \\lceil \\frac{3}{3} \\rceil = 1 \\text{ box}\n  \\]\n\nHence, the number of boxes required remains \\(\\boxed{1}\\). \n\nThis step-by-step approach reaffirms that \\(\\boxed{1}\\) box of graham crackers is what you need to satisfy the s'more requirements for 9 children and 6 adults.
