You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

      "content": "Great! We've determined that Elise writes a total of 182 letters. Hereâ€™s how the calculation breaks down:\n\n1. Writing the full alphabet three times results in \\(3 \\times 26 = 78\\) letters.\n2. Writing half of the alphabet once adds \\(13\\) letters.\n3. The total initial writing is \\(78 + 13 = 91\\) letters.\n4. Re-writing everything once means she writes another \\(91\\) letters.\n\nTherefore, the final count is:\n\\[ 91 \\times 2 = 182 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of letters Elise writes is \\(\\boxed{182}\\)."
