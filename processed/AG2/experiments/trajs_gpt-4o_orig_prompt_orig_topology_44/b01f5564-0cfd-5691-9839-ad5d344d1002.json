You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much protein John consumes when he eats 300 grams of mushrooms in one day and then calculate it for a week. This can be done with simple arithmetic calculations. Let's follow the steps below:\n\n1. Find the amount of protein in 1 gram of mushrooms.\n2. Calculate the daily protein intake from 300 grams of mushrooms.\n3. Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly intake.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Key idea: calculate the amount of protein per gram first, then scale up to daily and weekly intake\n\n# Given values\nmushroom_weight = 150  # grams\nprotein_in_cup = 4  # grams of protein in one cup (150 grams)\n\n# Calculate protein per gram of mushroom\nprotein_per_gram = protein_in_cup / mushroom_weight\n\n# John's daily intake of mushrooms\ndaily_mushroom_intake = 300  # grams\n\n# John's daily protein intake\ndaily_protein_intake = protein_per_gram * daily_mushroom_intake\n\n# Calculate weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein_intake = daily_protein_intake * 7\n\n# Output the result\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the number of grams of protein John gets per week. The expected output will be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{56}\n\\]\n\nThat's because John consumes 8 grams of protein per day from 300 grams of mushrooms, totaling \\(8 \\times 7 = 56\\) grams per week."
