You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

Find the cost per bottle of scotch.\n2. Calculate the number of cognac bottles John buys (which is twice the number of scotch bottles).\n3. Determine the cost per bottle of cognac (which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch).\n4. Calculate the total cost for the cognac.\n5. Calculate the total cost for everything by adding the cost of scotch and the cost of cognac.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch\ntotal_scotch_cost = 600\nscotch_bottles = 10\ncost_per_bottle_scotch = Rational(total_scotch_cost, scotch_bottles)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of cognac bottles\ncognac_bottles = 2 * scotch_bottles\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the cost per bottle of cognac (50% more expensive than scotch)\ncost_per_bottle_cognac = cost_per_bottle_scotch * (Rational(3, 2))\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the cognac\ntotal_cognac_cost = cognac_bottles * cost_per_bottle_cognac\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the total cost for everything\ntotal_cost = total_scotch_cost + total_cognac_cost\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(f\"Total cost for everything in rational form: {total_cost}\")\n```\n\nLet's run this Python code to get the total amount spent on the scotch and cognac."
