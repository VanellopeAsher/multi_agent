  "problem": "Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To make things more interesting, he decided to pay her back in a unique way. For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month. On the twelfth month, he will pay the remaining amount, including the interest, and also plans to buy a coin worth $100. How much will Stephen pay his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

Calculate the total amount Stephen needs to repay, including the interest.\n2. Determine how much Stephen pays his sister over the first 11 months.\n3. Calculate the remaining balance that he needs to settle in the twelfth month.\n\nLet's solve the problem using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial amount borrowed\nprincipal = 300\n\n# Total interest (2% of the borrowed amount)\ninterest_rate = Rational(2, 100)  # 2% expressed as a fraction\ninterest = principal * interest_rate\n\n# Total amount owed\ntotal_amount_owed = principal + interest\n\n# Amount paid per month for 11 months\nmonthly_payment = 25\ntotal_paid_in_11_months = monthly_payment * 11\n\n# Remaining balance to be paid in the twelfth month\nremaining_balance = total_amount_owed - total_paid_in_11_months\n\nprint(remaining_balance)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the amount Stephen needs to pay his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases."

Let's double-check the math:\n\n1. **Initial Borrowed Amount:**\n   - Stephen borrowed $300.\n\n2. **Interest:**\n   - Interest rate is 2%.\n   - Interest amount = \\( 300 \\times 0.02 = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Total Amount Owed (Principal + Interest):**\n   - Total = \\( 300 + 6 = 306 \\).\n\n4. **Amount Paid in First 11 Months:**\n   - Monthly payment = $25.\n   - Total for 11 months = \\( 25 \\times 11 = 275 \\).\n\n5. **Remaining Balance for Twelfth Month:**\n   - Remaining balance = \\( 306 - 275 = 31 \\).\n\nThus, the amount Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month (excluding his coin purchases) is \\(\\boxed{31}\\)."
