You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges.

We can write a simple Python program to perform these calculations using the given information:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially purchased.\n2. Subtract the boxes gifted to her mother and sibling.\n3. Determine how many boxes are left.\n4. Calculate the number of oranges in those boxes.\n5. Calculate how many oranges she retains and how many she sells.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially purchased\ntotal_boxes = 12\n\n# Number of boxes gifted to her mother and sibling\ngifted_boxes = 4\n\n# Number of boxes remaining after gifting\nremaining_boxes = total_boxes - gifted_boxes\n\n# Number of oranges in each box\noranges_per_box = 20\n\n# Total number of oranges in the remaining boxes\ntotal_remaining_oranges = remaining_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Mrs. Harrington retains a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself\noranges_retained = total_remaining_oranges / 4\n\n# Oranges sold are the remaining ones after retaining\noranges_sold = total_remaining_oranges - oranges_retained\n\nprint(oranges_sold)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the result of how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold.\n\nLet's execute this to find the number of oranges sold."
