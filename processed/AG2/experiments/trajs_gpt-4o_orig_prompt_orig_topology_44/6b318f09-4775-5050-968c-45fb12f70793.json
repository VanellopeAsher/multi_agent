You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

We need to determine the number of people invited, account for those who couldn't attend, and then find the final count of attendees.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Compute the total number of invited people.\n2. Subtract the number of people who couldn't attend due to illness.\n3. Subtract the number of people who couldn't attend due to other commitments.\n4. Determine the total number of people who show up.\n\nLet's write the Python code to do these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate total invited people\nfamilies_with_6_people = 12\nfamilies_with_4_people = 15\n\ntotal_invited_people = (families_with_6_people * 6) + (families_with_4_people * 4)\n\n# Calculate people who couldn't come\npeople_ill = 16\npeople_with_commitments = Rational(1, 4) * people_ill\n\n# Calculate people who show up\npeople_show_up = total_invited_people - people_ill - people_with_commitments\n\n# Print the result\nprint(people_show_up)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the total number of people who will show up at the party. Run the code to find the boxed answer."
