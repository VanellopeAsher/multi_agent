You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small t-shirts were used by Octavia to make the quilt. Let's use the information provided to set up an equation. \n\nKey idea:\n- We know the total area of the quilt and how much area each type of t-shirt contributes. We can express the total area in terms of small, medium, and large t-shirts and solve for the unknown quantity, which is the number of small t-shirts.\n\nGiven:\n- Total area of the quilt = 101 square feet\n- Area contributed by one small t-shirt = 3 square feet\n- Area contributed by one medium t-shirt = 4 square feet\n- Area contributed by one large t-shirt = 6 square feet\n- Number of medium t-shirts used = 8\n- Number of large t-shirts used = 6\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of small t-shirts used. The total area contributed by all t-shirts can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ 3x + 4 \\times 8 + 6 \\times 6 = 101 \\]\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to solve this equation for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(3*x + 4*8 + 6*6, 101)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The number of small t-shirts used is: {solution[0]}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the value of \\( x \\), which tells us how many small t-shirts Octavia used."
