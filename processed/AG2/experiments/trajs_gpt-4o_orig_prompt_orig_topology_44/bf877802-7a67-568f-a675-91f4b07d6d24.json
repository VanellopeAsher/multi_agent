      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the total change in the angle of the sun over the specified time period from its starting angle at 32 degrees from the ground.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. Identify the starting angle of the pyramid from Sahir's house.\n2. Calculate the angle change due to the first 10 hours of sun movement at 5 degrees per hour.\n3. Calculate the additional angle change after 2 more hours of sun movement at 3 degrees per hour.\n4. Sum these angle changes to find the final angle from the ground.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate these angles:\n\n```python\n# Starting angle from the ground to the pyramid's tip\nstarting_angle = 32  # in degrees\n\n# Sun movement for the first 10 hours at 5 degrees per hour\nangle_change_10_hours = 10 * 5  # 50 degrees\n\n# Sun movement for the next 2 hours at 3 degrees per hour\nangle_change_2_hours = 2 * 3  # 6 degrees\n\n# Total change in angle\ntotal_angle_change = angle_change_10_hours + angle_change_2_hours\n\n# Final angle from the ground to the sun\nfinal_angle = starting_angle + total_angle_change\n\nprint(final_angle)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this calculation to find the final result:\n\nRunning the code will give us the result directly as follows:\n\n```plaintext\n88\n```\n\nThus, after the 12 hours of movement, the sun will be \\(\\boxed{88}\\) degrees from the ground from Sahir's perspective."

Let's walk through the solution again clearly.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the final angle of the sun relative to the ground after it moves according to the given scenario. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The pyramid is at a 32-degree angle from Sahir's house.\n   \n2. **First Movement:**\n   - The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours.\n   - Total change in this period: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) degrees.\n\n3. **Second Movement:**\n   - Then, the sun moves at 3 degrees per hour for 2 additional hours.\n   - Total change in this period: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) degrees.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Add the changes to the initial angle: \\(32 + 50 + 6 = 88\\) degrees.\n\nThis is how the calculation is done using Python:\n\n```python\n# Starting angle from the ground to the pyramid's tip\nstarting_angle = 32  # in degrees\n\n# Sun movement for the first 10 hours at 5 degrees per hour\nangle_change_10_hours = 10 * 5  # 50 degrees\n\n# Sun movement for the next 2 hours at 3 degrees per hour\nangle_change_2_hours = 2 * 3  # 6 degrees\n\n# Total change in angle\ntotal_angle_change = angle_change_10_hours + angle_change_2_hours\n\n# Final angle from the ground to the sun\nfinal_angle = starting_angle + total_angle_change\n\nprint(final_angle)\n```\n\nThe solution to the problem is that after all of this movement, the sun will be \\(\\boxed{88}\\) degrees from the ground from Sahir's perspective."
