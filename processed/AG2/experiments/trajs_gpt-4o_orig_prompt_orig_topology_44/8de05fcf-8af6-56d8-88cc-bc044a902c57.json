You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday based on the information provided about Monday and Tuesday, and given the total hours worked over the three days. We know:\n\n- She wrote 5 articles on Monday.\n- On Tuesday, she wrote \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) times more articles than on Monday.\n- Each article takes 4 hours to write.\n- She spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over these three days.\n- We need to find how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as on Tuesday.\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps and solve it using Python where appropriate (Case 1):\n\n1. Calculate how many articles she wrote on Tuesday.\n2. Calculate the total number of articles written over the two days.\n3. Calculate how many articles she wrote on Wednesday using the total number of hours.\n4. Finally, calculate how many times more articles she wrote on Wednesday compared to Tuesday.\n\nLet's perform these calculations with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Given data\narticles_monday = 5\nhours_total = 104\nhours_per_article = 4\n\n# Articles written on Tuesday\nincrease_factor = Rational(2, 5)\narticles_tuesday = articles_monday + increase_factor * articles_monday\n\n# Total hours spent on Monday and Tuesday\nhours_monday_tuesday = (articles_monday + articles_tuesday) * hours_per_article\n\n# Remaining hours spent on Wednesday\nhours_wednesday = hours_total - hours_monday_tuesday\n\n# Articles written on Wednesday\narticles_wednesday = hours_wednesday / hours_per_article\n\n# Number of times as many articles on Wednesday vs Tuesday\ntimes_wednesday_tuesday = articles_wednesday / articles_tuesday\n\n# Output\nprint(f\"Articles written on Monday: {articles_monday}\")\nprint(f\"Articles written on Tuesday: {articles_tuesday}\")\nprint(f\"Articles written on Wednesday: {articles_wednesday}\")\nprint(f\"Times as many articles on Wednesday as on Tuesday: {times_wednesday_tuesday}\")\n```\n\nThis code will solve the problem and output the results in the desired format using fractions and exact arithmetic instead of decimals."
