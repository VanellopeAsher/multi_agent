  "problem": "Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money. If Walter's lawyer contributed $6600 in total, how much did his friend give him?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use reasoning and a bit of algebra.\n\nKey idea: \nWe need to calculate the total amount Walter collected (excluding his friend and lawyer), and then determine how much his friend contributed based on the lawyer's donation being three times the total of all others.\n\nLet's solve it step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount collected from neighbors and the online fund.\n2. Set up an equation representing the situation with the lawyer's donation.\n3. Solve the equation to find the amount contributed by Walter's friend.\n\nLet's begin:\n\n1. Walter collects $500 from neighbors and $1500 online, so the total collected from neighbors and the fund is:\n   \\[\n   500 + 1500 = 2000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Let \\( f \\) be the amount Walter's friend donated. Therefore, the total amount collected excluding the lawyerâ€™s contribution is:\n   \\[\n   2000 + f\n   \\]\n\n3. Walter's lawyer donates three times that collected amount:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (2000 + f) = 6600\n   \\]\n\n4. We solve for \\( f \\):\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for friend's donation\nf = symbols('f')\n\n# Define the equation 3 * (2000 + f) = 6600\nequation = Eq(3 * (2000 + f), 6600)\n\n# Solve the equation\nfriend_contribution = solve(equation, f)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(friend_contribution)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the equation to find the amount Walter's friend gave him."
