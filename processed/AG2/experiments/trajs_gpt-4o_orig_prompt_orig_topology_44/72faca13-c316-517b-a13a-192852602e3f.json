You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has from her coins.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the items she buys.\n3. Subtract the cost of the items from her initial amount to find out how much money she has left.\n\nLet's solve it using Python.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has.\n# Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.\n# 1 quarter = 25 cents, 1 dime = 10 cents\n\nquarters = 5\ndimes = 2\n\n# Calculate the total value of quarters and dimes\ntotal_money = quarters * 25 + dimes * 10\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items.\n# The can of pop costs 55 cents and the candy bar costs 45 cents.\n\ncost_pop = 55\ncost_candy_bar = 45\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_pop + cost_candy_bar\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the remaining money after the purchases.\nremaining_money = total_money - total_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\nLet's run the Python code to find the amount of money Kelly has left."
