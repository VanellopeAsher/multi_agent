  "problem": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use Python to calculate the number of apples each sister gathered. Here's the key idea for solving the problem:\n\n1. Calculate how many apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.\n2. Determine how many apples her sister gathers from both the tallest and shortest trees.\n3. Use the total number of apples gathered to solve for the missing values.\n4. Calculate how many times her sister's total from the shortest trees is compared to Joanne's from the shortest trees.\n\nLet's write the Python code for these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\ntallest_sister, shortest_sister = symbols('tallest_sister shortest_sister')\n\n# Joanne's apple gathering\ntallest_joanne = 30\nshortest_joanne = 30 / 2\naverage_joanne = 350\n\n# Sister's apple gathering\ntallest_sister = 2 * tallest_joanne\n\n# Total apples gathered\ntotal_apples = 500\n\n# Equation for shortest_sister's gathering\ntotal_sister = tallest_sister + shortest_sister\ntotal_joanne = tallest_joanne + shortest_joanne + average_joanne\n\n# Use an equation to find how many apples Joanne's sister gathered\nequation = Eq(total_joanne + total_sister, total_apples)\n\n# Solve for the number of apples from the shortest trees gathered by Joanne's sister\nshortest_sister_value = solve(equation, shortest_sister)[0]\n\n# Calculate how many times her sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees\ntimes = shortest_sister_value / shortest_joanne\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'Times Joanne’s sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees: {times}')\n```\n\nThis code defines the variables, sets up the equation based on the total number of apples gathered, and finds the solution by using SymPy to solve the equation. Then it calculates the multiplication factor between the apples gathered by the sister and Joanne from the shortest trees, and prints the result. Running this code will give you the answer to the problem."
