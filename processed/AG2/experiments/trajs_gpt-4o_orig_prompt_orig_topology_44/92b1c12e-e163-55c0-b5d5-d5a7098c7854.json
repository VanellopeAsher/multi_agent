You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Let's correct that step-by-step and make sure each part is clear.\n\nFirst, we solve the equation for Carver's daughter's age \\( D \\) from \\( 45 = 2D + 5 \\):\n\n1. \\( 45 = 2D + 5 \\)\n2. Subtract 5 from both sides: \\( 40 = 2D \\)\n3.

Substitute \\( D = 20 \\) into the equation: \\( 20 = 3S + 4 \\)\n2. Subtract 4 from both sides: \\( 16 = 3S \\)\n3. Divide by 3: \\( S = \\frac{16}{3} \\)\n\nThe son's age should be a whole number, so upon re-evaluation, the value seems correct in symbolic form, but real-life applications indicate a whole number is expected.
