You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.

We will use the provided relationships between the squares to construct our equations.\n\nHere's how we can solve it:\n\n1. Let \\( r \\) be the number of red squares. We know that \\( r = 14 \\).\n2. Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue squares. We know that \\( b = r + 4 \\).\n3. Let \\( g \\) be the number of green squares. We know that \\( g = b + 6 \\).\n4. Let \\( w \\) be the number of white squares. We need to find \\( g - w \\).\n\nThe total number of squares is 68, so:\n\\[ r + b + g + w = 68 \\]\n\nLet's write the program using these equations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Variables\nr, b, g, w = symbols('r b g w', integer=True)\n\n# Given values and equations\nequations = [\n    Eq(r, 14),        # r = 14\n    Eq(b, r + 4),     # b = r + 4\n    Eq(g, b + 6),     # g = b + 6\n    Eq(r + b + g + w, 68)  # r + b + g + w = 68\n]\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve(equations)\n\n# Calculate how much fewer white squares are than green squares\ndifference = solution[g] - solution[w]\n\n# Print out the result\nprint(\"Number of white squares fewer than green squares:\", difference)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will solve for \\( w \\) and return \\( g - w \\), the number of white squares fewer than green squares."
