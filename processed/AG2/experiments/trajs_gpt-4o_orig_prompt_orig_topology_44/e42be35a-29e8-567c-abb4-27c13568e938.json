At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to keep track of all the brownies Greta received throughout the day and subtract the brownies that were eaten. Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially:**\n   - Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.\n   - Her office gave her 1/2 dozen brownies. Since 1/2 dozen equals 6, she received 6 brownies from the office.\n   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. Since 4 dozen equals 48, she received 48 brownies from her friends.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of brownies eaten:**\n   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 dozen equals 18, 18 brownies were eaten.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of brownies left:**\n   - Add up all the brownies she initially had and subtract the number of brownies eaten.\n\nNow let's write a Python code to calculate the result:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of brownies Greta started with\nbrownies_from_self = 12  # 1 dozen\nbrownies_from_office = 6  # 1/2 dozen\nbrownies_from_friends = 48  # 4 dozen\n\ntotal_brownies = brownies_from_self + brownies_from_office + brownies_from_friends\n\n# Calculate the number of brownies eaten\nbrownies_eaten = 18  # 1 1/2 dozen\n\n# Calculate the number of brownies left\nbrownies_left = total_brownies - brownies_eaten\n\n# Print the result\nprint(brownies_left)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we find that the number of brownies Greta had left is \\(\\boxed{48}\\)."

The calculation shows that Greta has 48 brownies left after the events of the day.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Greta initially had 12 (self-made) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.\n- During the party, 18 brownies were eaten.\n- Therefore, 66 - 18 = 48 brownies were left.\n\nThank you for confirming the result.
