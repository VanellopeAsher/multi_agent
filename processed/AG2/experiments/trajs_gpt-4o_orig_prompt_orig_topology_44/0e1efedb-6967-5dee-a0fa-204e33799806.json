You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26.

Therefore, the initial total cost before applying the discount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost before discount} = 19 + 26\n\\]\n\nThe discount voucher reduces the total amount by $7. Thus, the total amount spent after applying the discount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = (19 + 26) - 7\n\\]\n\nFollowing the steps in the problem description, let's calculate this using Python. This situation is case 1 as it can be solved directly with a straightforward calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total cost before discount\ntotal_cost_before_discount = 19 + 26\n\n# Subtract the discount\ntotal_amount_spent = total_cost_before_discount - 7\n\n# Output the total amount spent\nprint(total_amount_spent)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll find that the total amount spent is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]"
