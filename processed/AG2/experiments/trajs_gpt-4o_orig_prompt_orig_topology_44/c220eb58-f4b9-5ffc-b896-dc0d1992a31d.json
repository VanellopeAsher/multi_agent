You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow Case 1 because it involves simple arithmetic calculations, which can be directly handled with Python code.\n\nJames delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson. We are also given that he delivers \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Therefore, we need to calculate \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 84 \\) to find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.\n\nOnce we have the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu, we simply add them to the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson to find the total.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Messages delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_to_thompson = 84\n\n# Messages delivered to Mr. Yu (1/3 of those to Ms. Thompson)\nmessages_to_yu = Rational(1, 3) * messages_to_thompson\n\n# Total messages delivered\ntotal_messages = messages_to_thompson + messages_to_yu\n\nprint(total_messages)\n```\n\nRunning this code will provide us with the total number of messages James delivers in fraction form, if applicable."
