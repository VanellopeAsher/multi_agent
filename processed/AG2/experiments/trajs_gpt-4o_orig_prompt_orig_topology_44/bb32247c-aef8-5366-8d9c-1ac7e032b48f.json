You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We will assume the initial height of the beanstalk is a variable \\( h_0 \\).\n\nKey Idea: This problem can be solved through simple arithmetic operations, which we can handle directly with Python code.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( h_0 \\) as the height of the beanstalk after the first week.\n- The beanstalk doubles its height in the second week.\n- The beanstalk grows an additional 4 inches in the third week.\n\nWe can solve this using the following steps:\n- Calculate the height after the second week: \\( h_1 = 2 \\times h_0 \\).\n- Calculate the height after the third week: \\( h_2 = h_1 + 4 \\).\n\nWe'll create a Python program to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the initial height variable\nh_0 = symbols('h_0')\n\n# Calculate height after second week\nh_1 = 2 * h_0\n\n# Calculate height after third week\nh_2 = h_1 + 4\n\n# Output the expression for the height after the third week\nprint(h_2)\n```\n\nWe use the `sympy` library to deal with the symbolic representation. The final height expression will depend on the initial height \\( h_0 \\) because the exact initial height isn't specified in the problem."

Since the problem does not specify the initial height \\( h_0 \\), we can't provide a numerical value for the final height. If you know the initial height, you can substitute \\( h_0 \\) with its value in the expression to get the numerical result. If the initial height is known, let me know, and I can compute it for you."

      "content": "To solve the problem completely, we need a specific value for the initial height \\( h_0 \\). Without it, all we can provide is the expression \\( 2h_0 + 4 \\). If you're provided with an initial height of the beanstalk, you can use that value to find the exact height after 3 weeks.\n\nFor illustration, let's assume some value for \\( h_0 \\). Say the beanstalk was 6 inches tall after the first week. We can substitute this value into the expression \\( 2h_0 + 4 \\).\n\nLet's compute the height in this case:\n\n```python\n# Assuming initial height of the beanstalk is 6 inches\nh_0_value = 6\nh_2_value = 2 * h_0_value + 4\n\n# Print the calculated height after the third week\nprint(h_2_value)\n```\n\nIf we run this calculation with an initial height of 6 inches, we would get:\n\n\\[\nh_2 = 2 \\times 6 + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16\n\\]\n\nThus, the height after 3 weeks would be \\(\\boxed{16}\\) inches, assuming the initial height is 6 inches. Adjust \\( h_0 \\) based on what the problem specifies or based on any value you provide for more accurate results."
