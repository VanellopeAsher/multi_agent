You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of lego pieces from the various boxes Johnny has.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of pieces in each box:**\n    - Box 1: 500 pieces.\n    - Box 2: Three times more pieces than Box 1, which means \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\) pieces.\n    - Box 3: A quarter of the pieces in Box 1, which means \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125\\) pieces.\n    - Box 4: 125 more pieces than in Box 1, which means \\(500 + 125 = 625\\) pieces.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pieces:**\n   - The total is the sum of all the pieces in the four boxes.\n\nHere's how we can do it using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of pieces in each set\nbox1 = 500\nbox2 = 3 * box1\nbox3 = Rational(1, 4) * box1\nbox4 = box1 + 125\n\n# Total number of pieces\ntotal_pieces = box1 + box2 + box3 + box4\n\n# Printing the total\nprint(total_pieces)\n```\n\nNow, let's compute the result using the code format specified:\n\n- Box 1 contains 500 pieces.\n- Box 2, which has \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\) pieces.\n- Box 3 has \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125\\) pieces.\n- Box 4 contains \\(500 + 125 = 625\\) pieces.\n\nHence, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is:\n\n\\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 + 625 = 2750 \\]\n\nThus, Johnny picks up \\(\\boxed{2750}\\) lego pieces."
