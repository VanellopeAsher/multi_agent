You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar.

We can solve the problem using Python code (Case 1).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Calculate the price of a half-gallon jar using the given relationship.\n2. Calculate the total cost for the gallon jars.\n3. Calculate the total cost for the half-gallon jars.\n4. Sum the two results to get the total amount spent.\n\nNow, let's write a Python program to carry out these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variables\ngallon_price = 5.5  # Price of a gallon jar\nextra_cost = 2.5  # Extra cost of a gallon jar compared to a half-gallon jar\n\n# Calculate the price of a half-gallon jar\nhalf_price = symbols('half_price')\nequation = gallon_price - half_price - extra_cost\nhalf_price_solution = solve(equation, half_price)[0]\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = 10 * gallon_price + 16 * half_price_solution\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and print the total amount of money Cecelia spent on the jars using the fractional/radical forms if necessary."
