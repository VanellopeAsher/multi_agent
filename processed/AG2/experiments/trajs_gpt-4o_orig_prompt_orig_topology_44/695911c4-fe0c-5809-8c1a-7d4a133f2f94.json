After 10 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's determine the total cost of all museum visits Pauline makes, taking into account the increase in ticket price after 10 years.\n\nWe'll break this down step-by-step as follows:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial cost**: For the first 10 years, determine the total cost based on the original ticket price.\n2. **Adjust for price increase**: After 10 years, calculate the new ticket price after a 150% increase.\n3. **Calculate the cost for the additional 3 years**: Based on the new ticket price.\n4. **Sum up both periods**: Add the costs from both periods to get the total.\n\nWe'll use Python to compute these values in a fraction form where necessary. Let's write the code.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Initial data\ninitial_price_per_visit = 10  # dollars\nvisits_per_year = 3\nyears_first_period = 10\n\n# Calculate the total cost for the first 10 years\ntotal_cost_first_period = initial_price_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_first_period\n\n# Increase in price after 10 years: 150% increase\nprice_increase_percentage = 150 / 100\nnew_price_per_visit = (1 + price_increase_percentage) * initial_price_per_visit\n\n# Calculate the total cost for the remaining 3 years with the new price\nyears_second_period = 3\ntotal_cost_second_period = new_price_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_second_period\n\n# Total cost for all visits\ntotal_cost = total_cost_first_period + total_cost_second_period\n\n# Using Fraction just to illustrate output in case of a non-integer, but here integer is expected\nprint(Fraction(total_cost))\n```\n\nThis program computes the total spent by Pauline on museum visits over the 13 years and outputs the result in fractional form.
