You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJoey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll start by determining Joey's and Marcy's scores after their respective turns and then find the difference to determine by how many points Joey is winning.\n\n**Key Idea:** We can solve this problem step-by-step using basic arithmetic operations, which can be handled directly using Python code. This is a Case 1 problem.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Joey starts with 214 points.\n2. Let's define the variable `x` to represent the points Joey scores on his turn.\n3. Marcy starts with 225 points and scores an additional 10 points on her turn.\n\nThe steps are:\n- Calculate Joey's total score after his turn.\n- Calculate Marcy's total score after her turn.\n- Find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's scores to see by how many points Joey is winning.\n\nHere's the Python code to express this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the variable for points Joey scores\nx = symbols('x', integer=True)\n\n# Calculate the new scores\njoey_new_score = 214 + x\nmarcy_new_score = 225 + 10\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = joey_new_score - marcy_new_score\n\n# Output the difference\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the symbolic expression for the difference in scores, showing by how many points Joey is winning depending on his scoring."
