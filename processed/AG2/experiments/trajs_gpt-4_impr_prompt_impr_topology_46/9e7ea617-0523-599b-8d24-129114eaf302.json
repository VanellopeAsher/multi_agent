In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Given that the shortest tree is 60 feet, we add 50 to 60 to find the height of the second tree. \n\nStep 2: Add the heights of the shortest and the second tree.\nOnce we have the height of both the shortest and the second tree, we add these together to get a combined height.\n\nStep 3: Determine the height of the tallest tree.\nThe question states that the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. So, we multiply the combined height from step 2 by 2 to get the height of the tallest tree. \n\nLet's now take this information to Agent Code Executor for calculation."

The combined height of the first two trees is 60 feet + 110 feet = 170 feet. Therefore, the tallest tree, which is twice the height as the combined height of the first two trees, is 2 * 170 feet = 340 feet.\n\nI can confirm that both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor correctly followed the steps and calculations, leading to the correct answer. The height of the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard is 340 feet.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{340}"
