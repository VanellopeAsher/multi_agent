In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells.

      "content": "Looking at the problem, the following assumptions can be made:\n\n1. There were 200 kids at the school trip. They were divided evenly into boys and girls, implying 100 boys and 100 girls. \n\n2. Each boy managed to gather 600 seashells. This means all the boys combined gathered 600 seashells * 100 boys = 60000 seashells.\n\n3. The girls managed to gather an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Hence, each girl gathered 600 (for the equal amount each boy gathered) + 4 * 600 (four times as many as each boy gathered) = 3000 seashells.\n\nSo, each girl gathered 3000 seashells."
