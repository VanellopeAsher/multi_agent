Determine the number of articles written on Tuesday: Since she wrote 2/5 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday equals 5 (Monday's articles) * (1+2/5)=7.\n\n2. Determine the time Meredith spent on articles on Monday and Tuesday: Each article needs 4 hours to write, so on Monday she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours, and on Tuesday she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of hours Meredith wrote on Monday and Tuesday, then subtract it from the total amount of time she wrote in the three days (104 hrs) to find out how many hours she wrote on Wednesday.\n\n4. Since each article requires an average of 4 hours of writing, divide the number of hours Meredith wrote on Wednesday by 4 to find the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday.\n\n5. To find out how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday, divide the number of articles written on Wednesday by the number of articles written on Tuesday."

Combined, she wrote for 20 hours on Monday and for 28 hours on Tuesday, which sums up to 48 hours for these two days.\n4. Given that she devoted 104 hours to writing articles over the three days, it means she wrote for 56 hours on Wednesday.\n5. As each article takes 4 hours to write, this entails that Meredith wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.\n6. Hence, the number of times the articles were written on Wednesday is twice that of Tuesday.\n\nThe aforemetioned analysis is based on the Python code execution and solution proposed by Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver, respectively. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{2}."
