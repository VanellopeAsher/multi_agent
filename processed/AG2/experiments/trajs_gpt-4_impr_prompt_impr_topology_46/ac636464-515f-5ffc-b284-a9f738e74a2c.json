      "content": "We can solve this task mathematically step by step:\n\n1. We first determine the initial distance James swims: this is 70% of 30 miles, equal to 0.7 * 30 = 21 miles\n2. Then, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. With a speed of 3 miles per hour, it takes 21 / 3 = 7 hours\n3. Next, we determine the resting time on the island. This is half of the swimming time, so it is 7 / 2 = 3.5 hours\n4. We then determine the remaining distance to swim. This is the total distance minus the initial distance, or 30 - 21 = 9 miles\n5. James swims this distance at half his original speed, or 1.5 miles per hour, so the remaining swim time is 9 / 1.5 = 6 hours\n6. Finally, we add up the swimming time, resting time, and remaining swim time to get the total time it took for James to cross the lake. In total, it took 7 + 3.5 + 6 = 16.5 hours."
