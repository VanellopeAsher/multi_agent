In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Distance John runs on the remaining day.\n\nWe know John runs half as much on the remaining day, so to find this value, we would divide the distance of two days by 2.\n\nFor the speed, we need more information such as time. How long does he take to run the miles? As speed is generally calculated as distance/time, without time, we can't get an accurate speed. Can you provide this info?"

The time he spends running is a crucial part of calculating speed because speed is distance divided by time. As such, without this information, it is impossible to accurately calculate John's speed. Could you please provide the time it takes for John to run each week? It would also be helpful to know how the time is allocated across the three days he runs."

The speed can not be calculated based on just the distance run; the time taken to cover that distance is an integral part of this calculation. Since we cannot assume values, and neither the Problem Solver nor the Code Executor can offer a valid solution without this information, I have to conclude there is no viable solution currently. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**."
