      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total length of the two remoras: 2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches.\n2. The combined length of the two remoras is equal to 10% of the shark's total body length. Thus, we can express this relationship mathematically as: Shark's total body length = Total length of the two remoras / 10%\n3. Solve the equation.\n\nThe answer to the question will be the solution of the equation solved in step 3 above."
