In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

For this, add the 3 pounds from Robert, the 5 pounds from Cindy, and the 4 pounds from Aaron.\n\n2. Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people, which is 3 in this case (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron). \n\nThe result from step 2 is the amount of candy each person would have after they decide to share equally. The halloween toys Aaron has are irrelevant to this question as they are not being shared or counted as part of the candy."

Each of Robert, Cindy, and Aaron will have 4 pounds of candy after they pool and share it equally."
