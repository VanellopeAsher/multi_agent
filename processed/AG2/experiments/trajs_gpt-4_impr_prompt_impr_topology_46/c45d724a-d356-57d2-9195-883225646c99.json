      "content": "Here is the step-by-step solution for the problem above:\n\n1. We know that each notebook costs $15.00 and William bought 50 notebooks, so we can find the total cost of the notebooks by multiplying the price of each notebook by the quantity. That is: $15.00 * 50 = $750.00.\n\n2. Similarly, we know that each ballpen costs $5.00 and William bought 10 ballpens. We can find the total cost of the ballpens using the same calculation method: $5.00 * 10 = $50.00.\n\n3. To find the total amount spent, we simply add the total costs of the notebooks and the ballpens: $750.00 + $50 = $800.00.\n\nSo, William spent $800.00 in all."

First, we calculate the total cost for the notebooks by multiplying the price of one notebook (15.0) by the number of notebooks bought (50).\n2. Then, we calculate the total cost for the ballpens by multiplying the price of one ballpen (5.0) by the number of ballpens bought (10).\n3.
