      "content": "Let's approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Compute the age for the sisters: If all sisters have the same age and that age is 1.6 times of 10, then each sister's age is 1.6 * 10 = 16 years.\n\n2. Compute the total age for the sisters: Since there are 3 sisters with the same age, the total age of sisters would be 3 * 16 = 48 years.\n\n3. Compute the age for the younger brother: One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old. So, the younger brother's age is = 3/5 * 20 = 12 years.\n\n4. Compute the age for the older brother: The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother. So, the older brother's age is 2 * 12 = 24 years.\n\n5. Finally, compute the total age of all siblings: The total age would be the sum of all the individualâ€™s age. Therefore, their total age would be: Age of sisters + Age of younger brother + Age of older brother = 48 years (sisters) + 12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother) = 84 years. \n\nSo, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."

Calculate the age of the sisters from the statement that their age is \"1.6 times of ten\". This will be done by multiplying 1.6 by 10.\n2. Multiply the age obtained in step 1 by the number of sisters (3) to obtain the total age of the sisters.\n3. Calculate the age of one brother from the statement that his age is \"3/5 of 20 years old\". This will be done by multiplying 3/5 by 20.\n4. Compute the age of the second brother from the statement that his age is \"half the age of the older brother\". The younger brother's age will be multiplied by 2 to get the age of the older brother.\n5. Sum all the ages calculated in steps 2, 3, and 4 to get the total age of the siblings as the final result.\n6. Print the final result.\n\nNow let's write the Python code to do this calculation."
