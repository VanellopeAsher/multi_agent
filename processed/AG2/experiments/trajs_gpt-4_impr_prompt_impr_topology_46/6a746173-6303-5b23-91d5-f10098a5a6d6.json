This is done by adding $300 (from the neighbors) to $1200 (from the online fund).\n2. Factor in the additional $120 from Walter's friend. Add this amount to the total collected so far.\n3. The lawyer's contribution is three times the total amount collected from all sources, excluding him. To get the lawyer's contribution, multiply the collection sum from step 2 by three. The result of this multiplication is the lawyer's contribution. Let's carry out these calculations."
