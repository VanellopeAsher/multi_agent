In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Reggie ran a distance that was five times Paisley's distance: Reggie's distance = 5 * Paisley's distance\n3. Reggie ran also 3 miles more than Lynn: Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3\n\nWe can combine these statements and solve for Lynn's distance.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Replace Reggie's distance in the two equations so they're equal to each other: 5 * Paisley's distance = Lynn's distance + 3\n2. Substitute Paisley's distance (4 miles) into the equation: 5 * 4 = Lynn's distance + 3\n3. Solve the resulting equation for Lynn's distance."
