We know that Carver's age (45 years old) is equal to 10 times his son's age minus 15 years.\n\nWe can express this as:\n\n10x - 15 = 45\n\nSolving this equation for `x` will give us the age of Carver's son. You can solve it by:\n\n1. Add 15 to both sides of the equation, which will give: 10x = 60.\n2. Divide both sides by 10 to solve for x: x = 6.\n\nSo, Carver's son is 6 years old."
