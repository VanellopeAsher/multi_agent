      "content": "First, let's break down the total hours Frankie watched TV each day.\n\n1. On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watches an hour-long episode each day. So for two days, the total hours are 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\n2. On Wednesday, he watches three 30-minute episodes. Each hour contains 60 minutes, so 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. Therefore, the total hours on Wednesday are 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n\n3. On Thursday, he watches an hour (= 1 hour) of episodes and a 30-minute (= 0.5 hours) show. Therefore, the total for Thursday is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n\n4. On Friday, he watches two one-hour episodes which add up to 2 * 1 = 2 hours.\n\nIf we sum up all the hours, we get the total hours he watched TV: 2 (for Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 (for Wednesday) + 1.5 (for Thursday) + 2 (for Friday). \n\nThe next step will involve calculating the sum. Open for anyone to verify."
