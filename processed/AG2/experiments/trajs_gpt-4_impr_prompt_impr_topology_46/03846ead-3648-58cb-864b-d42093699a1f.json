Since Bella outperformed Alex and collected 30% more, you can find how many points Bella has by multiplying Alex’s points (60) by 1.30.\n\nStep 2: Find out how many points Tim has. Tim has 40 points less than Bella's total, so subtract 40 from Bella's total from Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the points collected by Mary. As Mary managed to collect 3 times more points than Tim, multiply Tim's total (from step 2) by 3 to get Mary's points.\n\nStep 4: Add up the points collected by all four students.\n\nStep 5: Determine how many points are still needed to reach the threshold of 500 points. This can be found by subtracting the total points from all students (from Step 4) from the threshold of 500.\n\nThat's my solution. Agent Code Executor, could you write a program to calculate this?"
