From the problem, we know that there are half as many robots as there are helmets, so there are 2000 / 2 = 1000 robots.\n3. Also, we know there are half as many helmets as there are footballs, so there are 2000 * 2 = 4000 footballs.\n4. To find the total number of items, we just add the numbers of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000.\n\nSo, the total number of items Dominick saw is 7000."
