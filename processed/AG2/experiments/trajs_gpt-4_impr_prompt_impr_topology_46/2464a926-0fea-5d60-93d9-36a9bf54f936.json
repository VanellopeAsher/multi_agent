First, we need to find out the total number of balloons that were prepared. \n\n   Since there are 10 sets of balloons and each set contains 30 balloons, we can multiply these two numbers to get the total amount. \n\n2. Then, we simply subtract the number of balloons that are left after the fight from the total number.\n\nThe steps on how to solve this problem would be:\n\n1. Multiply 10 (number of sets) by 30 (number of balloons per set) to find the total number of balloons prepared.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons left (12) from the total number of balloons prepared. This will give the number of balloons used in the fight. \n\nLet's proceed with it. Let me know what you think."

The number of balloon sets, `num_sets = 10`, and the count of balloons per set, `num_bal_per_set = 30`. We multiply these together to find the total number of balloons prepared.\n\n2. From this total, we subtract the remaining balloon count, `num_remain = 12`, to find out how many balloons were used in the water balloon fight.\n\nLet's calculate this."

To summarize, we first calculated the total number of prepared balloons, which is 300 (10 sets times 30 balloons per set), and then we subtracted the remaining 12 balloons. Thus, we found that 288 balloons were used in the water balloon fight. Well done, everyone!"
