For each bag the trader buys, he spends $20 (the cost of the bag itself) and $2 (transportation cost), totaling to $22. \n\nHe then sells each bag for $30. The profit for the trader after selling one bag would then be $30 - $22 = $8. \n\nConsidering the trader made a total profit of $400, we can create the following equations and solve for \"x\":\n\n$8x = $400\n\nWhich means\n\n\\[\nx = $400/$8 = 50 \\textit{ bags of wheat}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."

They both agree that the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. \n\nTheir calculation approaches are similar - both agents subtracted the combined bag cost and transportation cost from the selling price per bag to determine profit per bag. Then, they divided the total profit by the profit per bag to find the number or bags sold. Both agents justify taking these steps and their proposed solutions are mathematically correct. \n\nThe correct solution is what both agents proposed: The trader sold 50 bags of wheat. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{50}."
