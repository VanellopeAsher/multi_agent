For 3 vaccines, the cost will be 3 times $20. \n\nStep 2: Apply the 10% discount on the total vaccine cost. To find 10% of an amount, we multiply that amount by 0.10. Reduce the total vaccine cost by this 10%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost of vases broken. There are 4 vases broken and each costs $12. The total cost for the broken vases will be 4 times $12. \n\nStep 4: Now, add up the cost for spaying, the discounted cost of vaccines and the cost of broken vases to find the total cost so far. \n\nThe sum of these will be the total cost of owning the kitten so far."
