To find out what Courtney reported, we would use this formula:\n\nLet's denote:\n- `C` - Courtney's report\n- `M` - the mistake percentage made by Courtney (discounted from the factual size)\n- `F` - the factual size of the audience\n\nWe can express this situation in an equation format:\n\n ```\n C = F + F * (M/100)\n ```\n\nGiven that `M = 20%` and `F = 40` (according to Kelly's claim), we can substitute these values into the equation above:\n\n ```\n C = 40 + 40 * (20/100)\n ```\n\nBy solving the equation above, we’ll get Courtney's reported audience size. According to the problem description, it should be 48. To confirm this, let’s solve the equation. If the result fits what is mentioned in the problem description, then Courtney's report was indeed 48. If not, we should check Kelly's claim again."
