In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Let's approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Compute the total cost of the phones. For this, we multiply the cost of one phone by the quantity purchased. In this case, $700 per phone * 5 phones = $3500 for the phones total.\n\n2. To find the total purchase, add the cost of the tablet and the headphones to the cost of the phones. As such, $3500 (phones total) + $330 (tablet) + $137 (headphones) = $3967 in total purchase.\n\n3. The difference between what the buyer gave and the total purchase will be the change. Deducting the total purchase from the amount given, we get: $4000 - $3967 = $33 returned to the buyer as change. \n\nSo, the seller has to give back $33 to the buyer in change."
