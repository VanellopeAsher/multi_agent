In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Suzanne collected from selling cookies and cupcakes.\n2. Add up the amount of money she gave her sisters and donated to the charity.\n3. Subtract the total expenses (money given to sisters and charity) from the total earnings (money collected from selling cookies and cupcakes). This will give us Suzanne's remaining money after expenses.\n\nLet's break it down in details:\n\n1. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each: That means she earned from cookies: 80 * $1 = $80\n2. She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each: Which means she earned from cupcakes: 60 * $4 = $240\n3. The total amount collected from selling: $80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320\n\nThen we calculate the expenses:\n\n1. She gave her two sisters $10 each: Total given to sisters will be: 2 * $10 = $20\n2. She donated to charity: $15\n\nSo, total expenses will be: $20 (given away to sisters) + $15 (donated to charity) = $35\n\nFinally, we subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find out the remaining money:\n\n Remaining money = Total earnings - Total expenses = $320 - $35 = $285\n\nTherefore, Suzanne has $285 left from her earnings."
