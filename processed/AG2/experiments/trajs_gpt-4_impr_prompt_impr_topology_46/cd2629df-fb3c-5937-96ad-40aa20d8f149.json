This will be the principle amount that he borrowed ($300) plus the interest (2% of $300).\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how much Stephen has already paid his sister in the first 11 months. As he pays $25 per month, the total amount paid in the first 11 months will be $25 times 11.\n\n3. Finally, we subtract the amount paid in the first 11 months from the total amount owed (including interest).

But you can run the given Python code in your local environment to get the output. To ease the process, let me guide you through the steps:\n\n1. First, you will need to have Python installed on your local machine. If it's not installed already, you can do so by downloading it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). \n\n2. Then, open a new Python file in your preferred code editor (IDLE, PyCharm, VSCode, etc.). \n\n3. Copy the Python code provided in the previous response and paste it into the new Python file.\n\n4. Run the file, and you will see the output displayed either in the console of your code editor or in a separate command prompt/terminal window, depending on your code editor settings. \n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!"

      "content": "As per the steps given in the problem and the Python code, here's what you can do:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount that Stephen owes his sister with interest. The principle amount that Stephen borrowed is $300, and the interest rate is 2%.\n   \n   The formula to calculate the amount with interest is: principle_amount + principle_amount * interest_rate\n   So, you get: 300 + 300 * 0.02 = 306\n\n2. Calculate how much Stephen has already paid his sister in the first 11 months. Since he pays $25 per month, the total amount he has paid in the first 11 months will be 11 * 25 = 275\n   \n3. Finally, calculate the amount that Stephen will pay his sister in the 12th month, excluding his coin purchases. This will be the total amount owed minus what he has already paid. So, we get: 306 - 275 = 31\n\nSo, Stephen will pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases."
