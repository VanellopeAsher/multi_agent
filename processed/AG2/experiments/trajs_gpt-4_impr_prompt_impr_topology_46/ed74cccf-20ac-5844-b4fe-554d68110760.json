      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of students by adding up the number of students in each group. Given in the problem:\n\n1. There are 6 students playing tennis.\n2. There are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, which means there are 2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball.\n3. There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. The total number of students playing soccer is not explicitly given, so we know there are 22 students playing soccer at least.\n\nTo get the total number of students, we add the number of students in each group which is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 22 (soccer) = 40. So, there are at least 40 students in total. However, as we don't know the exact number of boys playing soccer, there could be more. \n\nWithout information on the number of boys playing soccer, we can't give an exact number but can say that there are at least 40 students in total."

So, there are at least 40 students in total, and possibly more if there are any boys playing soccer."

Both agents correctly identified the parameters given and used these to calculate the number of individual students playing each sport: 6 playing tennis, twice that amount (12 students) playing volleyball, and at least 22 students playing soccer. The total minimum number of students is 40, with the potential for more if there are boys playing soccer. Since the number of boys playing soccer is not given, the final solution is that there are at least 40 students participating in these sports.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{40}"
