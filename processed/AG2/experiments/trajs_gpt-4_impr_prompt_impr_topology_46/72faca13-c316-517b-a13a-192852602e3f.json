We know that one quarter is 25 cents and one dime is 10 cents.\n\nKelly has:\n* 5 quarters - equals to 5*25 cents = 125 cents\n* 2 dimes - equals to 2*10 cents = 20 cents\nTotal Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents\n\nNext, let's subtract the cost of the can of pop and the candy bar from the total amount of money Kelly has:\n\n* Cost of pop = 55 cents\n* Cost of candy bar = 45 cents\n* Total cost = 55 cents + 45 cents = 100 cents\n\nFinally, let's find out how much money Kelly has left: \nKelly's remaining money = Total Kelly's money - Total cost = 145 cents - 100 cents = 45 cents\n\nSo, Kelly will have 45 cents left."

I have reviewed their processes and they both appear to be accurately following the problem's requirements.\n\nThey both correctly started by computing the total amount that Kelly originally has. Using the values given in the problem (5 quarters and 2 dimes), the calculation was (5 * 25 cents) + (2 * 10 cents), which resulted in a sum of 145 cents. \n\nThen, they calculated the total cost of the pop and candy bar which is 55 + 45 cents = 100 cents. \n\nThe correct calculation for what Kelly has left over is Kelly's original total (145 cents) - the cost of what was spent (100 cents). \n\nTherefore, the final solution is 45 cents.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{45}**"
