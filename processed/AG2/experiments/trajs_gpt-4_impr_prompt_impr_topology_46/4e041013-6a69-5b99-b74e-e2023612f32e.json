First, let's look at the red tulips. Given that Jackson can accommodate 6 red tulips in a single row and that he has 36 red tulips, we can find out the number of rows needed by dividing the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row.\n\n2. Next, let's consider the blue tulips. Jackson can plant 8 blue tulips per row and has 24 blue tulips. We use the same procedure as for the red tulips, dividing the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row.\n\n3. Finally, we add together the number of rows required for the red tulips and the blue tulips to get the total number of rows."
