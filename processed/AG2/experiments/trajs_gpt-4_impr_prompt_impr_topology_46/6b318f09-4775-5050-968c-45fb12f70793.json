So 16 / 4 = 4 people had previous commitments.\n\nStep 3: Calculate how many people did not come to the party.\nAdd the number of people who couldn't attend due to illness and those who had previous commitments: 16 + 4 = 20.\n\nStep 4: Finally, calculate the number of people who attended Martha's party.\nSubtract the number of people who did not come from the total number of invitations sent: 132 - 20 = 112 people attended Martha's party."
