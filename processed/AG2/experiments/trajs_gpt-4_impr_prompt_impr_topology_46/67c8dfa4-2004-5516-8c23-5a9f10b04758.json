      "content": "To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the amount Tara earned from selling each bag, which is the selling price minus the cost price ($8 - $4 = $4). Then, we can determine the total quantity of bags she sold by dividing the profit by the profit from selling one bag ($160 / $4 = 40).\nSince the bags were bought in packs of 5, the number of packs Tara bought is the total quantity of bags sold divided by the quantity of bags per pack (40 / 5 = 8).\n\nSo, Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags.\n\nLet's review the steps more formally:\n\n1. Calculate the profit from selling one bag = Selling Price - Cost Price.\n2. Calculate the number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit from selling one bag.\n3. Calculate the number of packs bought = Number of bags sold / Quantity of bags per pack. \n\nUsing the numerical values given in the problem:\n\n1. Profit from selling one bag = $8 - $4 = $4.\n2. Number of bags sold = $160 / $4 = 40 bags.\n3. Number of packs bought = 40 bags / 5 bags/pack = 8 packs. \n\nHence, Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags."

Agent Problem Solver sketched a solution that explained the logic step by step, which was then successfully implemented in Python by Agent Code Executor. \n\nThe profits Tara made show that she sold 40 bags in total. Since each pack contains 5 bags, she must have bought 8 packs. \n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the Python code:\n\n1. The profit from selling a single bag is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price, which equals $4.\n2. The number of bags sold is calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit from selling a single bag, giving 40 bags.\n3. The number of packs Tara bought is calculated by dividing the number of bags sold by the number of bags per pack, yielding 8 packs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is confirmed: Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags."
