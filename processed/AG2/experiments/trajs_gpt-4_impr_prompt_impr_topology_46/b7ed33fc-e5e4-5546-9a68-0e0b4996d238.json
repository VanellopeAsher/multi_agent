Given that he drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, he would need 90/30 = 3 bottles of water to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle.\n\nAdding these together, for both puzzles, he would drink a total of 1 + 3 = 4 bottles of water.\n \nHence, John drinks 4 bottles of water to solve both a normal and an extreme sudoku puzzle."

This would be 1 bottle per half hour.\nThen, calculate the time John spends on a normal sudoku and an extreme sudoku. It's given that a normal sudoku takes 30 mins (which is a half hour) and an extreme sudoku takes 3 times as long. \n\nFinally, multiply the time it takes for each type of sudoku by the 'bottle_rate' to get the total bottles of water John drinks.\n\n```python\n# Define the rate at which John drinks bottles\nbottle_rate = 1  # 1 bottle per half hour\n\n# Define sudoku times - in the units of half hours\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30 / 30  # 30 minutes is one half hour\nextreme_sudoku_time = 3 * normal_sudoku_time  # Extreme sudoku takes three times as long\n\n# Calculate the total number of bottles drunk\ntotal_bottles = (normal_sudoku_time + extreme_sudoku_time) * bottle_rate\n\nprint(total_bottles)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will provide the required verification."
