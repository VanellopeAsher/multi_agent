      "content": "The solution to this problem involves two steps:\n\nStep 1: Convert 4 feet to inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, for 4 feet we have 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. \n\nStep 2: Divide the total length of the wire (in inches) by the number of pieces obtained. This gives us the length of each individual piece. Hence, the length of each piece in inches is 48 inches / 8 = 6 inches.\n\nSo, each piece was 6 inches long."

The wire has been cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the length of each piece will be the total length divided by the number of pieces. So, each piece will be 48 inches / 8 = 6 inches long.\n\nNow, let's write the python code for the same. \n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert the length from feet to inches\ntotal_length_inches = 4 * 12\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the length of each piece\npiece_length = total_length_inches / 8\n\nprint(piece_length)\n```\n\nExecuting the above line of code will give the desired result."
