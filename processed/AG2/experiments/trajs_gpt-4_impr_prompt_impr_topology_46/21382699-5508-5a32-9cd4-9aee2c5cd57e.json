We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11 and their total age is 162 years.\n   Using this information, we can set up the following equation, where A represents Allen's age and D represents Darrell's age:\n\n   7/18*D + 11/18*D = 162\n\n2. Solving this equation, we find that Allen's current age (A) is 99 years and Darrell's age (D) is 63 years.\n \n3. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.\n\nSo, Allen will be 109 years old ten years from now."
