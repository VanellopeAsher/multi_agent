For the news website, it's 20 articles per day. For its sister company, it's 10 articles per day.\n\n2. Then, we add these two values together to get the total average number of articles published by both websites daily, which would be 20 + 10 = 30 articles per day.\n\n3. The problem states that there are 2.8 times of ten days in February. This means there are 2.8 * 10 = 28 days in February.\n\n4. Finally, to get the total number of articles published in February, we multiply the total average number of articles published daily by the number of days in February. Which is 30 * 28.\n\nLet's do the calculation."
