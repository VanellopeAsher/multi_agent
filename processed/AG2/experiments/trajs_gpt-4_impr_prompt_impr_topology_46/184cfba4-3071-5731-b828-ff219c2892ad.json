      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use algebra:\n\nInferred from the problem, we know that:\n- Small stuffed animals cost $40 each.\n- For each large stuffed animal, Teresa sells, she earns three times the price of a small stuffed animal, i.e., $40*3 = $120.\n- She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small animals sold can be represented as `2x` , and the number of large ones can be represented as `x`, where `x` is the number of large stuffed animals.\n\nIt's mentioned that she earned $1200 from the sales. We use this equation to solve for the number of animals sold:\n\nSmall stuffed animals' sales + Large stuffed animals' sales = Total sales\n$40*(2x) + $120*x = $1200\n\nWe can then solve this equation for `x` to find the number of large stuffed animals sold. Once we know that, we simply double that number to find the number of small stuffed animals sold. However, we first need to simplify the equation on the left side:  \n\n80x + 120x = 200x = $1200.\n\nLet's solve this step by step further."
