So, we first need to determine the number of yellow ties he bought. \n\nThe cost of the green ties is 70% more than the cost of the yellow ties. Since yellow ties cost $30, we can calculate the cost of a green tie by adding 70% to this amount. \n\nFinally, the problem states that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. As there is no information given about the cost of red or blue ties, or the number of blue ties, we cannot determine how much he spent on red or blue ties."

We can only determine the costs of the yellow and green ties.\n\nLet's represent this mathematically:\n\nLet X be the number of yellow ties John bought. As given, each yellow tie costs $30, and the total spent on yellow ties is $300.\n\nSo, $30 * X = $300 which gives us X.\n\nThen, the cost of the green ties is 70% more than the yellow ties. We can calculate this by taking the price of the yellow tie and adding 70% of $30 to it.\n\nLet Y be the cost of the green tie.\n\nBy the problem, the cost of the red and blue ties can't be calculated since no sufficient data is given.\n\nLet's calculate X and Y."

Indeed, John purchased 10 yellow ties for a total of $300, and each green tie costs $51. However, the problem does not provide the number of green ties bought or the prices and quantities of the red and blue ties. Consequently, a final total sum for the amount John spent on ties cannot be computed accurately.
