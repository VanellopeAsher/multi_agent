Given: \"Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female\" and \"there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland\". We can set up a proportion to solve for the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n\n    (2/3) * Total Unicorns in Scotland = 6\n\n2. Solving the above equation, we can find the total number of Unicorns in Scotland.\n\n3. Next, \"A third of them are in the Scottish Highlands\", implies that the total number of unicorns in the world is three times the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n\n4. Multiply the total number of unicorns in Scotland by 3 to find the total number of unicorns in the world.\n\n5. Finally, to find how many are left in the world excluding Scotland, subtract the total number of unicorns in Scotland from the total number of unicorns in the world."

      "content": "The problem is about ratios and proportion. Given that two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland are female and there are 6 female unicorns, we can calculate the total number of unicorns in Scotland. Then, given that a third of all unicorns are in Scotland, we can calculate the total number of unicorns globally. Lastly, we can find the number of unicorns outside Scotland by subtracting the number of unicorns in Scotland from the global count. Here is how you can solve the problem in Python.\n\n```python\n# The number of female unicorns in Scotland\nfemale_unicorns = 6\n# Two thirds of the unicorns in Scotland are females\n# So, the total number of unicorns in Scotland\ntotal_unicorns_scotland = female_unicorns / (2/3)\n\n# A third of the total unicorns are in Scotland, hence the total number of unicorns in the world\ntotal_unicorns_world = total_unicorns_scotland * 3\n\n# The number of unicorns outside Scotland is the total in the world minus those in Scotland\nunicorns_outside_scotland = total_unicorns_world - total_unicorns_scotland\n\nprint(unicorns_outside_scotland)\n```\n\nYou can run the above Python code to find the number of unicorns outside Scotland."

      "content": "Let's verify the solutions provided by both agents.\n\n1. As per the solution of Agent_Problem_Solver, the steps mentioned to solve the problem are logically correct. The agent set up the right ratio to calculate the total number of unicorns in Scotland using the fact that 2/3 of them are female and there are 6 female unicorns. Then, the agent correctly deduced that if 1/3 of the total unicorns are in Scotland, the total number of unicorns worldwide would be the total in Scotland times 3. Finally, to get the remaining unicorns in the world excluding Scotland, subtracted the total unicorns in Scotland from the total worldwide.\n\n2. Agent_Code_Executor has provided a Python code that implemented the same logic in code which gives the output as 18.0. The code works orrectly as intended, calculating the total number of unicorns in Scotland, then the total number of unicorns in the world and finally the number of unicorns outside Scotland.\n\nTherefore, based on the discussion and verification of both the solutions, there are 18 unicorns left in the world excluding Scotland. The solutions provided by both agents are correct and consistent with each other."
