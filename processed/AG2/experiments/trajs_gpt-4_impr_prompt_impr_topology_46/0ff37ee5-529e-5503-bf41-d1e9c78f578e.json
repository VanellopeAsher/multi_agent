This is equal to the total amount of money Ali has, which we'll refer to as \"total_money\".\n3. If Ali gives half of his total money to his sister, he is left with total_money / 2.\n4. When Ali spends 3/5 of his remaining money (total_money / 2) on dinner, he is left with $32. Therefore, we can form the equation (2/5) * (total_money / 2) = $32.\n5. We just need to solve this equation to find the value of T. \n\nLet's proceed to solve this equation."
