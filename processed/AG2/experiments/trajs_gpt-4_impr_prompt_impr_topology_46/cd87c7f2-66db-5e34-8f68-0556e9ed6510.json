The total number of balloons was accurately calculated as 1000 by multiplying the 10 packs by the 100 balloons per pack.\n2. The remaining balloons, 120, were correctly subtracted from this total.\n3. This correctly leaves 880 balloons as the number thrown.\n\nThe solutions of the Problem Solver and the Code Executor thus fulfil the task and there were no discrepancies between their answers. Further verification is not necessary in this case."

This was computed through a two-step process: calculating the total number of balloons initially, and then subtracting the number of balloons left. It's fantastic how methods and conceptual explanations matched up, resulting in an accurate and efficient answer. Great teamwork agents!"
