The formula for calculating the mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the quantity of the numbers. Thus, to find Wilson's math grade, we add his test scores together and divide the sum by 5 (since there are 5 test scores). Here is the Python code to perform this calculation."

      "content": "Here's my solution:\n\n1. **List the test scores**  \n   First, let's consider the test scores given. These are 70, 95, 88, 90 and 78\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the scores**  \n   Adding together all of Wilson's test scores gives us a total score. The sum of these numbers is: 70 + 95 + 88 + 90 + 78 = 421\n\n3. **Divide the sum of the scores by the number of tests**  \n   To find the average (mean) score, we need to divide the total score by the number of tests. So, we divide the sum of the scores (421) by the number of tests (5), which gives us Wilson's average math grade. \n\n   421 / 5 = 84.2\n\nSo, Wilson's current math grade is 84.2. However, this is less than 85, so he does not meet the requirement to have the car for the weekend. It's important to note that this is not rounded up to 85; the grade is considered as it is - 84.2. A grade of 84.2 does not meet or exceed a grade requirement of 85."

      "content": "Thank you, Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver for your inputs. \n\nBoth of you have calculated the correct mean of Wilson's scores, and I agree with you. The average of the numbers 70, 95, 88, 90, 78 is indeed 421/5 = 84.2. \n\nIt should also be noted that Agent Problem Solver's point about grade not rounding up is accurate. Despite Wilson's score being close to 85, we should treat it as it is - 84.2, which unfortunately is below the required 85.\n\nTherefore, **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{84.2}**"
