      "content": "1. Determine the total amount of money for the wooden figures. For four days, Peter spends a certain amount daily for the wooden figures. We calculate this amount by dividing his total money ($70) equally for the seven days in a week. \n\n2. Determine the number of wooden figures he bought. Since each wooden figure costs $5, we divide the total amount spent on wooden figures by the cost of each figure.\n\n3. Determine the total amount of money spent on the plastic figures. This is equivalent to the total amount of money for three days (since he bought plastic figures from Thursday to Saturday).\n\n4. Determine the number of plastic figures he bought. Since each plastic figure costs $2.5, we divide the total amount spent on plastic figures by the cost of each figure.\n\n5. Finally, calculate the total number of wooden and plastic action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. This is the sum of the number of wooden figures and plastic figures he bought."

      "content": "Both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have proposed their solutions. Agent Problem Solver formulated a plan that involves dividing Peter's total money by the number of days in a week, thereby establishing a daily limit. The agent used this daily limit to calculate the amount spent on wooden figurines for four days and plastic figurines for three days. This, when divided by the cost of each respective figurine, gives the total number of each type bought. The total figurines bought is the sum of wooden and plastic figurines.\n\nThe plan was rightfully executed by Agent Code Executor and a total number of 20 figurines obtained. The individual cost per figurine, the total budget, and the number of days Peter bought both the wooden and plastic figurines were appropriately accounted for, with no extraneous assumptions made. The the proposed solution is valid and is accepted. \n\nFinal Solution Declaration: Peter will have 20 figures by the end of the week.\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{20}**."
