Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

      "content": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to sum up the minimum payments for all the debts, which are the student loan, credit card, and mortgage: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate 50% more than the minimum of the total debt: $1000 * 50% = $500. \n\n3. To get the actual monthly payment, we add the additional 50% to the minimum monthly total: $1000 + $500 = $1500.\n\n4. Finally, for an annual amount, we multiply this monthly total by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.\n\nThis means Jessica pays $18,000 a year, taking into account a 50% increment on her debt payments.\n\nNote: The subscriptions have their costs offset or unchanged, and therefore, don't factor into the debt calculations as we're only adding the extra 50% payment to the debts, not the subscriptions."

It first defines the minimum payments for the student loan, credit card, and mortgage. \n2. It then calculates the total minimum payment by summing up these amounts. \n3. After that, it calculates the amount that is 50% more than this total. \n4. It then adds this extra amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly total. \n5. Finally, it computes the total annual payment by multiplying this monthly total by 12. \n6. It then prints the result, representing the total amount Jessica pays for her debts in a year. I can execute the code if commanded. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: User."

Agent Problem Solver did an excellent job explaining the process step by step, which was then effectively implemented by Agent Code Executor in Python code.\n\nIt was verified successfully that the calculated amount does not include the costs of any subscriptions because Jessica is not paying extra for those. The extra 50% payment was applied exclusively to her debts. It's important we noted that.\n\nLooking forward to more problem-solving with you all!"
