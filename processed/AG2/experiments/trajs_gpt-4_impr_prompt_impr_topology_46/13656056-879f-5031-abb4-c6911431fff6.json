Since he works every day and the week is 7 days, his earnings for the week will be 7(days) * 300(dollars/day).\n\nAfter that, we'll subtract the amount he spent, which is $1000, from the total amount he earned during the week.\n\nBy doing this, we will be able to find out how much he has left."

They correctly implemented the operations necessary to solve the problem: multiplication to calculate total earnings and subtraction to determine the remaining amount after expenses. Running the code resulted in the output which matches the mathematical solution.
