Calculate the total amount of money Colby has by converting each denomination into cents and adding them together. Quarters are worth 25 cents, dimes 10 cents, nickels 5 cents and pennies 1 cent.\n2. Divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball, which is 25 cents.\n\nThe result will give the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, assuming he can only buy whole gumballs, not parts of them. So, we will use the integer division (floor division) operator, which discards the remainder and only returns the integer part of the quotient. This will ensure our answer makes sense in the real world context of buying gumballs."

He first calculates the total value that Colby has, then uses the cost of one gumball to calculate how many complete gumballs Colby can afford.

Therefore, based on the money Colby has, he can buy 13 gumballs. \nDoes anyone have anything to add?"

The value of each coin denomination was calculated in cents by the Agent Code Executor, followed by the calculation of the total value in cents. \n\nThen, the integer division of the total value (in cents) by the cost of a gumball (also in cents) to know how many gumballs can be bought. The cost of each gumball was provided by the Problem Solver Agent as 25 cents.\n\nThe Agent Code Executor implemented this in the Python code and calculated that Colby can buy 13 gumballs in total. Agent Problem Solver also suggested the same number. \n\nAfter critically evaluating the solution, I found that both the provided solutions accurately followed the given requirements. \n\nTherefore, the final solution is that Colby can buy 13 gumballs.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{13}."
