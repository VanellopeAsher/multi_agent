      "content": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. Bruce worked for 5 hours on Tuesday.\n2. On Wednesday, he worked double the duration of Tuesday, which is 5 hours x 2 = 10 hours.\n3. On Thursday, he worked 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday, so he worked 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours.\n4. So, the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days is the sum of the hours he worked each day: Tuesday's 5 hours + Wednesday's 10 hours + Thursday's 8 hours = 23 hours.\n \nTherefore, Bruce worked for a total of 23 hours from Tuesday to Thursday."

After that, we will calculate the hours worked on Wednesday (double the hours of Tuesday) and on Thursday (2 hours less than Wednesday). Finally, we will add these hours to find the total hours worked in the three days. \n\n```python\n# Hours worked by Bruce on Tuesday\ntuesday_hours = 5\n\n# Hours worked by Bruce on Wednesday (double the hours of Tuesday)\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\n\n# Hours worked by Bruce on Thursday (2 hours less than Wednesday)\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# Total hours worked by Bruce\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\n\nprint(total_hours)\n``` \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

After reviewing their explanations and solutions, I confirm that their methods are correct. They both correctly followed the problem's steps: \n1. Start with the given value for Tuesday, which is 5 hours. \n2. Calculate Wednesday's hours by doubling Tuesday's hours to get 10 hours. \n3. Determine the hours for Thursday by subtracting 2 hours from Wednesday's hours resulting in 8 hours.\n4. Sum up the hours for the three days which yields a total of 23 hours.\n\nTherefore, the sum of hours that Bruce has worked over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is correct. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{23}**."
