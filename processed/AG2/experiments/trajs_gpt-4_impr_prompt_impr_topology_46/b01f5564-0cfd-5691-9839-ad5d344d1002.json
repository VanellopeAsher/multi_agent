      "content": "My approach to solving this problem is as follows:\n\n1. Find the protein content in 300 grams of mushrooms: Since 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein, 300 grams will contain double the amount of protein, which is 8 grams.\n2. Calculate the protein intake per week: Since John consumes 300 grams of mushrooms daily, he consumes 8 grams of protein every day. Over a week (7 days), he would consume 8 grams/day * 7 days = 56 grams of protein. \n\nSo, John gets 56 grams of protein from mushrooms per week."

To make it more general, I will define a function that calculates the weekly protein intake for arbitrary daily intake and nutrient content:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_weekly_protein(daily_intake, cup_weight, protein_per_cup):\n    # Calculate protein content in daily intake\n    daily_protein = (daily_intake / cup_weight) * protein_per_cup\n    # Calculate weekly intake\n    weekly_protein = daily_protein * 7\n    return weekly_protein\n```\n\nWe can now use this function to calculate John's weekly protein intake:\n\n```python\ndaily_intake = 300  # grams\ncup_weight = 150  # grams\nprotein_per_cup = 4  # grams\n\nweekly_protein = calculate_weekly_protein(daily_intake, cup_weight, protein_per_cup)\nprint(weekly_protein)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code and verify the results. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

The function executed successfully and provided a result of 56 grams, matching the solution from the Problem Solver Agent. \n\nAfter reviewing these solutions, I can conclude that they match and are correct. \n\nTherefore, John will consume **56 grams** of protein from mushrooms per week.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{56}**."
