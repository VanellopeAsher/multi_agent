      "content": "To solve this problem, we will go step by step through each day, calculating the changing water levels:\n\n1. On Monday, we are provided that the water depth is 17 feet.\n\n2. On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than it had on Monday. Therefore, on Tuesday, the depth of water = Depth on Monday + 7 feet\n\n3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Hence, on Wednesday, the depth of water = 2/3 of the depth on Tuesday\n\n4. On Thursday, the tank's water depth increased by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday. Thus, on Thursday, the depth of water = Depth on Wednesday + 1/2 * (Depth on Tuesday - Depth on Wednesday)\n\nThe final answer will be the depth of water calculated for Thursday. Let's apply these steps one by one."
