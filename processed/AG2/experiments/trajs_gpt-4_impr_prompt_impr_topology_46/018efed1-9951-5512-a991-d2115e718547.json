In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week: Gerald earns $30 every day and there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, for the entire week, Gerald earns 30 * 7 = $210.\n  \n2. Calculate Gerald's expenses: To find out how much Gerald spent, we subtract the amount he saved from his total earnings. Therefore, Gerald's expenses are $210 (Total earnings) - $110 (Savings) = $100. \n\nTherefore, Gerald spent $100 during that week."
