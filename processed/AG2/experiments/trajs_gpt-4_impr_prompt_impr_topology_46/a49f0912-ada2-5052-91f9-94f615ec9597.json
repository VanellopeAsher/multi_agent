      "content": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to find out the total time John spent on his vacation. We know that he watched 30 different shows which were 20 hours each. This is equal to 30*20 = 600 hours. However, this represents only 30% of his total vacation time. So, the total time he spent on vacation is 600/0.30 = 2000 hours.\n\n2. We're asked to find out how much time he spent sightseeing. We know that he spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. So, the time he spent sightseeing is 2000*0.40 = 800 hours.\n\nTherefore, John spent 800 hours sightseeing."

The total time John spent on vacation is calculated as 600 (time spent on watching shows) divided by 0.30 (percentage of total time).\n\n2. Then the time he spent sightseeing is calculated as 40% of the total time found in step 1. So, we multiply the total time by 0.40. \n\nLet's get into code."
