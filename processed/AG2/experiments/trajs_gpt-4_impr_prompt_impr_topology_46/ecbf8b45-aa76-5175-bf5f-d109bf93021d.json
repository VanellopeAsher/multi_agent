Let's say that number is 'n'.\n- Since each pack contains 30 balloons, we can calculate the total number of balloons filled by multiplying 'n' by 30.\n- Finally, given that the number of leftover balloons is 12, we can know how many balloons were thrown by subtracting the leftover number from the total number of balloons filled.\n\nWe can't proceed with the calculation right now because 'n' is not specified in the problem. Could you please provide the number of packs of balloons filled?"
