Hence, these 20 students represent the remaining one-fourth of total students. To get the total number of students, we multiply 20 by 4.\n\nFollowing the above two steps, we can find the total number of students at that grade level."

We have the following known facts:\n\n1. 20 students do not have a desktop computer, and this group of students represents one-fourth of all students.\n2. This same group of students (those without a desktop computer) is also one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer.\n\nWith these facts, we can proceed as follows:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer. \n        - We know that these students are three times as many as those who do not have a desktop computer.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of students.\n        - We know that the 20 students who do not have desktop computers make up one-fourth of the total number of students. Hence the total number of students can be obtained by multiplying 20 by 4.\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer \nstudents_without_comp = 20 * 3\n\n# calculate the total number of students\ntotal_students = 20 * 4\n\nprint(total_students)\n```"

Both solutions are sound and are based on the same logic:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer. The problem statement states that the 20 students without a desktop computer represent one-third of the students in this category. Therefore, multiplying 20 by 3 gives us the total number of students without either a desktop or a laptop. \n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of students. The problem states that the 20 students without a desktop computer correspond to one-fourth of the student body. Thus, to find the total number of students, we multiply 20 by 4.\n\nThe Python code confirmed these calculations, resulting in a total of 80 students. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{80}"
