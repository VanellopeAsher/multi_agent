It's clear that Mark is losing 10 pounds per month, and he ends up at 70 pounds, but we need to know for how many months he was ill so we can accurately calculate his initial weight. \n\nLet's denote Mark's initial weight as W and the number of months he was unwell as M. Given that he was losing 10 pounds per month, the relationship between these elements can be expressed as:\n\nW - 10 * M = 70\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find out the value of M (the time Mark was unwell)."
