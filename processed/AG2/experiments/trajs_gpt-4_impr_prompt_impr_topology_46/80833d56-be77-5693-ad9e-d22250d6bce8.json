      "content": "Let's reason this problem step by step.\n\n1. John runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, so he runs for (2 * 10 * 0.5) = 10 hours the other two days.\nHe therefore runs for 10 + 10 = 20 hours a week.\n\n2. He runs a total of 100 miles in these 20 hours.\n\n3. To find out the speed at which he runs, we divide the total miles he runs by the total hours he runs. \n\nSo, the speed would be calculated as Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 mph."
