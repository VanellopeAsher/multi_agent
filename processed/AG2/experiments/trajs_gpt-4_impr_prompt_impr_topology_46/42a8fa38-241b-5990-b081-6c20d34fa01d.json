Calculate the cost for tomato seeds: Multiply the quantity of tomato seed packets (20) by the price per packet ($40).\n\n2. Calculate the cost for celery seeds: Multiply the quantity of celery seed packets (80) by the price per packet ($30).\n\n3. Calculate the total cost: Add the cost for tomato seeds and celery seeds together.\n\nLet's calculate these."
