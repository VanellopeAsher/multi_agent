To do this, we multiply the initial price of the toy by 80% (or 0.80), then add the result to the initial price.\n\n   Result after December increase = initial price + (initial price * 0.80)\n\n2. Next, we calculate the price of the toy after it was discounted in January. We do this by multiplying the price from step 1 by 50% (or 0.50), then subtracting the result from the price from step 1.\n\n   Final price after January discount = Result after December increase - (Result after December increase * 0.50).\n\nLet's execute these calculations."
