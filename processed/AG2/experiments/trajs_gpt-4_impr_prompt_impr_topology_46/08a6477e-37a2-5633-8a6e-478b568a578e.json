      "content": "Looking at the problem, the steps to solve this can be broken down as following:\n\n1. Given that a nurses' station ordered one bulk pack of bandages on the first day and had 19 bandages to start with, the total number of bandages they had after the delivery is 19 (initial stock) + 50 (one pack) = 69 bandages.\n\n2. The stations used 10 fewer bandages on the second day than the first day, which means the number of bandages used on the first day is equal to the number of bandages used on the second day plus ten.\n\n3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2*50 = 100 bandages. In addition, they only used half a pack of bandages, which is 0.5*50 = 25 bandages. \n\n4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. This means that the total number of bandages remaining plus the ones used on day three should equal the sum of the bandages available at the beginning of day three. Or, putting it mathematically, the total bandages at the start of day 3 (remaining bandages from day 1 and 2 plus new ordered bandages) is equal to the bandages used on day 3 plus the bandages left, i.e., (remaining bandages from first day and second day + 100 newly ordered bandages) = 25 (bandages used on third day) + 78 (remaining bandages).\n\n5. From these points, we can figure out how many bandages were left after the first and second day and thus determine how many bandages were used on the first day."

      "content": "Let's write a Python code to solve this problem. \n\n1. First, we calculate the total number of bandages the nurses’ station had after the first delivery. \n2. Then, we create a variable for the number of bandages used on the second day.\n3. Next, we calculate the number of bandages left after the second day.\n4. Afterwards, we calculate the total number of bandages the station had at the beginning of the third day.\n5. Finally, we solve for the number of bandages used on the first day by subtracting the number of bandages left after the first day from the total number of bandages the station had at the beginning of the day."
