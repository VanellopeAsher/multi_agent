      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n1. From the problem, we can understand that in 5 years Emil will be 26 years old.\n2. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad: Meaning Emil's dad will be 26 * 2 = 52 years old. However, that is in 5 years time. To find his dad's current age, we subtract 5 years from 52 which gives us 47 years.\n3. Similarly, Emil will be twice as old as his brother in 5 years time. Hence, his brother will be 26 / 2 = 13 years old in 5 years. To get the brother's current age, we subtract 5 from 13 giving us 8 years.\n4. Finally, we find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother which is 47 + 8 = 55 years.\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 55 years."

It first calculates the future ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the conditions given in the problem: Emil's dad is double Emil's age, and Emil's brother is half of Emil's age in five years. Then, to find the current ages, it subtracts 5 years (the time difference to the future scenario) from both future ages.
