Well done, team!\n\nWe can summarize our process as follows:\n\n - We began by identifying all known scores.\n - We calculated the total sum of scores using the given mean and the total number of quizzes.\n - We then subtracted the sum of known scores from this total to find the missing score, which was 60. \n\nThis solution is consistent and should be applicable to similar problems."
