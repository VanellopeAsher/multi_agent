The problem established that James delivered 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many to Mr. Yu.\n\nAgent Problem Solver's Steps:\n   - Step 1: Verified the number of messages James delivered to Ms. Thompson as 84.\n   - Step 2: Correctly calculated the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as 1/3 of 84, which equals 28.\n   - Step 3: Proposed to add the numbers of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu for the total.\n\nAgent Code Executor's Steps:\n   - Step 1: Correctly represented the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson in code (msg_thompson = 84).\n   - Step 2: Computed the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as a third of this number (msg_yu = msg_thompson / 3 = 28).\n   - Step 3: Calculated the total messages by adding the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu (total_messages = msg_thompson + msg_yu = 112).\n   - The code successfully ran and output was 112.\n\nBoth agents' solution steps are correct, and there's no assumption involved. James must deliver a total of 112 messages. The final solution is **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{112}**."
