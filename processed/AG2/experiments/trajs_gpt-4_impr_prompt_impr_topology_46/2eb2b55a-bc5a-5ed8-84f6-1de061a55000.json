      "content": "To tackle this problem, following steps can be taken:\n\n#### Step 1\nFirstly, given that the medical staff purchased one large pack of bandages on the initial day, we can understand that they received 50 bandages because one pack contains 50 bandages.\n\n#### Step 2 \nAlso on the initial day, they used 38 bandages. Therefore, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.\n\n#### Step 3\nOn the second day, it is stated that the team used 10 bandages less than what they used on the previous day. Since they used 38 bandages on the initial day, they therefore used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on the second day.\nAt the beginning of the second day, they had the remaining 12 bandages from the first day. Thus, they had 12 bandages at the start of the day and used 28 bandages during the day, which means they had to have additional bandages at the start. The number of these additional bandages is the number we are looking for (the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day).\n\n#### Step 4\nTo calculate this, notice that the bandages used on the second day (28) must be subtracted from the remaining stock of bandages from first day (12), which gives us -16. This means that they must have had 16 bandages on hand at the beginning of the first day before purchasing more.\n\n#### Step 5\nBut on the second day, they didn't buy any additional bandages. That is important to note, because it means the stock of bandages they had was the one they had at the beginning of the first day (the one we are looking for) plus one pack that they bought that day.\n\n#### Step 6\nThis initial stock of bandages was enough for the first and second day, so it must be 38 (bandages used on the first day) + 28 (bandages used on the second day)=%bandages used on the first and second day%=66\n\n#### Step 7\nSo, there were 66 +    bandages at the beginning before they bought additional on the first day.\n\nGiven that bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack, and they bought one pack on the initial day, the total amount of bandages they had on the initial day (the beginning of the first day) must be 66 (the number of bandages used on the first and second day) + 50 (the number of bandages in a pack that they bought on the first day) = 116\n\nSo, they had 116 bandages at the beginning of the first day."
