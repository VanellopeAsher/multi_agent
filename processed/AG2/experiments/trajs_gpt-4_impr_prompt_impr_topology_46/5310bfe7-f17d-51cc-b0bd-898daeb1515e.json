      "content": "1. Based on the provided information, we know that Richie scored 90 goals.\n2. Since Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark, we can figure out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 30 from Richie's score. So Mark scored 90 - 30 = 60 goals\n3. Similarly, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 55 from Richie's score, since Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna. As a result, Anna scored 90 - 55 = 35 goals\n4. To find out the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we simply add the number of goals each teenager scored. Which means the total goals will be: 90 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 185 goals \n\nSo, it can be concluded that the three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."

Since Richie scored 90 goals, which is 30 more than Mark, as a result, Mark scored 90 - 30 = 60 goals. Also given that Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna, Anna scored 90 -55 = 35 goals. Summing up all these values, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 90 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 185 goals. \n\nTherefore, the final solution is: \n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{185}**."
