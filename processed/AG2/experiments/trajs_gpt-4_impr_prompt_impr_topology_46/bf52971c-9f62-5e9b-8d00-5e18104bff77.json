So, the total money he has initially is 4*10 + 6*20 = $160.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount:**  \nThe initial amount Ali has, is the sum of the four $10 bills and six $20 bills.\n\n2. **Half given to sister:**  \nAli gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the remaining amount of money with Ali is one half of the initial amount.\n\n3. **Money spent on dinner:**  \nAli uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. Thus, the amount of money left with Ali is 2/5 of the amount after giving his sister half of what he initially had.\n\n4. **Calculate the remaining amount:**  \nThe remaining amount with Ali after buying the dinner is the remaining 2/5 from the amount after he gave his sister her share.\n\nThe given problem does not require information about the money Ali's sister gives to their mother for its solution, as that transaction does not affect Ali's remaining amount. In the steps explained above, I didn't take it into account."
