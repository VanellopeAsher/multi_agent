      "content": "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples.\n   - The chicken meal costs $120.\n   - The cost of the milk is 5 packs times $30 each, which equals $150.\n   - The cost of the apples is 40 apples times $1.50 each, which equals $60.\n   - Add all of these costs together: $120 + $150 + $60 = $330.\n\n2. Next, deduct this total from the total amount of money Marie paid to find out how much she spent on pizzas.\n   - Total amount Marie paid: $900\n   - Deduct the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples: $900 - $330 = $570.\n\n3. Finally, divide this remaining amount by the cost of each pizza box to determine the number of pizza boxes.\n   - Each pizza box costs $57.\n   - The amount Marie spent on pizzas divided by the cost of each pizza box equals the number of pizza boxes: $570 / $57 = 10 boxes.\n\nSo, Marie ordered 10 boxes of pizza."

The solution was achieved by first calculating the total cost of non-pizza items and subtracting that from the total paid or cost to find the cost spent on pizzas. Finally, the number of pizza boxes was found by dividing the cost spent on pizzas by the cost per box, resulting in 10 pizza boxes. \n\nSo, we can confidently say that Marie ordered 10 boxes of pizza, rounding our answer to the nearest whole number since we cannot have fractional pizza boxes."
