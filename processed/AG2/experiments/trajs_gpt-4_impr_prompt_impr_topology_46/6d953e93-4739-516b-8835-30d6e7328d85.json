For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.

      "content": "Here is my proposed solution:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate total earning of the mechanic on Thursday. The given information is that mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at a rate of $60 each tire and he repaired 4 car tires at $40 each.\n2. Thus, total earnings on Thursday = (6 * $60) + (4 * $40)\n3. It's also given that mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. Therefore, we can denote mechanic's earnings on Friday as F.\n4. Thus, total earning on Thursday = F + $40\n5. Given, mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires on Friday, so whatever he earns is from repairing car tires at a rate of $40 each. Hence the number of car tires repaired is F / $40.\n6. From the above, we equate (6 * $60) + (4 * $40) = F + $40\n7. Solving the above equation we can find F, and then, number of car tires repaired on Friday."
