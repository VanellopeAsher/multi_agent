In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Solution:\nWe can solve this problem using simple arithmetic operations in the following steps:\n\n1. Griffin had 30 fries initially.\n2. Kyle took away 6, leaving Griffin with (30 - 6) = 24 fries.\n3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 6 = 12 fries. This leaves Griffin with (24 - 12) = 12 fries.\n4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 6 - 3 = 3 fries. After Colby, Griffin is left with (12 - 3) = 9 fries.\n5. In the end, Griffin had 33 fries. So it means, Ginger must have given Griffin (33 - 9) = 24 fries. \n\nSo, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries."

Griffin had 30 fries initially.\n2. Kyle took away 6 fries leaving Griffin with 24 fries.\n3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, i.e. 12 fries. After this, Griffin was left with 12 fries.\n4. Colby took 3 fries less than Kyle had taken, which is 3 fries. Now, Griffin was left with 9 fries.\n5. In the end, Griffin had 33 fries, meaning Ginger must have given Griffin 24 fries.\n\nAfter reviewing both solutions, I can confirm that they are accurate and consistent with each other. Therefore:\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries."
