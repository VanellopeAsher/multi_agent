Calculate the initial prices paid by each person:\n\n    - Clara: 15 apples * $15/apple = $225\n    - Sheila: 15 apples * $25/apple = $375\n\n2. Factor in the discounts:\n\n    - Clara: $225 - $3 voucher = $222\n    - Sheila: $375 - (15% * $375) = $318.75\n\n3. Calculate the difference between the amounts each person paid: $318.75 - $222 = $96.75.\n\nSo the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila for the apples is $96.75."

By following the instructions, they correctly found the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila for the apples.\n\nThey first calculated the initial prices paid by Clara and Sheila. After that, they factored in the discounts given to both individuals, calculating Clara's final amount with a simple deduction of the voucher value and Sheila's with a deduction of 15% from the total price she would have initially paid. Finally, they found the difference between these two final amounts, confirming a difference of $96.75. \n\nI agree with their results and confirm their solution is correct."
