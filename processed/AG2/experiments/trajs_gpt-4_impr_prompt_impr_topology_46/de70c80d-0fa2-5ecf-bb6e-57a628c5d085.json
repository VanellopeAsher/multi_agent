In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

The agent correctly identifies the composition of the English alphabet and successfully applies this to compute the accurate total number of letters written by Elise through strategic addition and multiplication.\n\nIn parallel, Agent Code Executor code checks the hand-calculated solution from Agent Problem Solver by writing a simple Python script that mirrors the earlier computation steps. The execution of this code returns the same result, which verifies the accuracy of the computations done by Agent Problem Solver.\n\nBased on this evidence, I can confidently determine that Elise has written a total of **182** letters.\n\nHence, SOLUTION_FOUND: **\\boxed{182}**."
