Add up the cost of all the food items: $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $2 (cookies) + $1 (water)\n2. Add up the cost of all non-food items before tax: $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps)\n3. Calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items and add it to the total cost of the non-food items.\n4. The sum of the above two steps will give us the total cost. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculations."
