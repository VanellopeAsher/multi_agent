She has 6 presents for her family members, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers. This makes a total of (6+4+2) presents.\n2. Next, calculate the ribbon length she can allocate for each present. Monica has 144 inches of ribbon, and we need to divide this by the total number of gifts. Hence, the individual ribbon length for each present is 144/total number of presents.\n3. Get the result, which will give us the length in inches of ribbon she can allocate for every present's bow."

Determine the total number of presents by adding the number of presents Monica has for each group: family, friends and teachers. \n2. Calculate the length of ribbon that can be allocated for each present. This can be achieved by dividing the total length of the ribbon by the total number of presents. \n\nLet's execute these steps using Python:"

This solution and code outcome is precise and accurate."
