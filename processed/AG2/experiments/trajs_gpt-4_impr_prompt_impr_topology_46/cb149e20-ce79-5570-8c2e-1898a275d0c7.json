      "content": "To solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we determine how much money Ava gave Jayden. As Ava gave half of her $90 allowance, Ava gave Jayden $90 / 2 = $45.\n\n2. We then determine how much money Jayden has after receiving money from Ava by adding the money he got from Ava to the money he got from selling pictures. Hence, Jayden's total sum of money is $70 (Picture Sales) + $45 (money from Ava) = $115.\n\n3. Finally, we determine how much the camera costs. It is given that Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera after receiving money from Ava and selling his pictures. This means that the camera costs $115 (Jayden's total money) + $85 (additional needed money) = $200. \n\nIn conclusion, the camera costs $200."
