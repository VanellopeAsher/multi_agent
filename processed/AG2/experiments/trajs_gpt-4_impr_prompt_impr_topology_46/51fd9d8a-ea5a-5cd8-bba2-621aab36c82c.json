      "content": "Here's how I interpret the problem and my approach to solving it:\n\nWe have three individuals - Peter (P), Paul (Ph), and John (J). We also have the relationships between their ages:\n\n1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is one tenth of one thousand years old - so P + Ph + J = 100\n\n2. Paul is one tenth of one hundred years older than John - so Ph = J + 10\n\n3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age - so P = Ph + J\n\nThe problem therefore boils down to one of substituting these relationships into the equations and solving for the various ages. This process can be done in a number of different ways, but one approach is to start by substituting equation (2) into (1) and (3) for Paul's age.\n\nFrom equation (1) we get P + J + 10 = 100, which simplifies to P + J = 90\n\nFrom equation (3) we get P = J + 10,\nLet's substitute equation (3) in equation (1) to find the age of Peter.\n\nLet's now implement this solution."
