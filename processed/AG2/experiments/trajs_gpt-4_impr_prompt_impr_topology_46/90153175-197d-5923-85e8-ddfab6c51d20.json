In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Let's break down the problem into simpler steps.\n\n1. First, let's find out how many eggs Claire consume per week. We know that she uses 3 eggs per day for her omelet, so to find out how many eggs she consumes for 7 days we multiply 3 by 7. \n\n2. We then take that weekly consumption and multiply it by 12 to find out how many eggs she will consume for 12 weeks.\n\n3. To convert eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 because a dozen is defined as twelve of something.\n\n4. Apply the math: First, calculate the total number of eggs consumed daily, then convert to weeks, and finally convert to dozens.\n\n5. We should end up with a numeric answer representing the dozens of eggs Claire will consume over 12 weeks. \n\nLet's execute these steps."

As the calculation has accounted for all supplied variables and assumptions given in the problem statement, and as no assumptions were made on missing information, I confirm the solution is correct. \n\nThe final solution is as follows: Claire will consume 21 dozens of eggs if she continues to make a 3-egg omelet every day over the course of 12 weeks.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{21}"
