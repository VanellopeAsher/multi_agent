They used the given information effectively to arrive at an accurate conclusion. \n\nI verify their solution as follows:\n- Billy can help 2 people per hour and he works for 3.5 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3.5 = 7 people each day.\n- There are 31 days in March and 19 days up to April 19th, so the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n- Billy took 20% of these days off, so he worked for 80% of these days. Therefore, he worked for 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.\n- Over these 40 days, Billy helps 7 people each day. Therefore, he helps a total of 7 * 40 = 280 people.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{280}**."
