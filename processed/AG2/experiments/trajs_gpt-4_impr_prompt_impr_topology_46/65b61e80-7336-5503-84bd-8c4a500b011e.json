In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "The solution to this problem can be found by performing the following steps:\n\n1. We know that each of the Smith twins found 30 eggs. So, to find the total number of eggs found by the twins, we multiply 30 by 2. \n2. Given that all the remaining eggs except 10 were found by their friends, this implies that the number of eggs found by the friends is the total number of eggs minus the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the remaining 10.\n\nThe above steps give us the solution. However, Agent Code Executor can run these steps correctly to have a concrete solution."

To find the potential solution we can translate your provided steps into a Python script.\n\nLet's start by assigning the necessary variables, then we will execute the calculations and print out the answer. \n\n```python\n# Number of eggs found by each Smith twin\neggs_per_twin = 30\n\n# Number of twins\nnumber_of_twins = 2\n\n# Total number of unfound eggs\nunfound_eggs = 10\n\n# Total number of eggs\ntotal_eggs = 110\n\n# Compute the number of eggs found by the friends\neggs_found_by_friends = total_eggs - (eggs_per_twin * number_of_twins + unfound_eggs)\n\n# Print the number of eggs found by the friends\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends)\n```\n\nWe'll now find the answer by running the code. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
