      "content": "This can be solved by creating and solving a simple equation:\n\nLet `x` be the age of Carver's son. We know that Carver just turned 60, which according to the problem is 8 years less than twice the age of his son. \n\nThis can be mathematically expressed as: \n\n60 = 2x - 8\n\nTo find `x` (the son's age), we can solve the equation. \n\nFirst, add 8 to both sides of the equation:\n\n60 + 8 = 2x - 8 + 8 \n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n68 = 2x\n\nThen, to solve for `x`, divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = 68 / 2\n\nThis will give us the age of Carver's son. \n\nLet's calculate it."

Let's evaluate them:\n\nAgent Problem Solver provided an algebraic solution by defining an equation based on the problem statement and then solving it to find the son's age, as follows:\n\nStep 1: Creation of the equation '60 = 2x - 8' based on the problem statement.\n\nStep 2: Addition of 8 to the equation, resulting in '68 = 2x'.\n\nStep 3: Division by 2, resulting in 'x = 34'. x represents the son's age or the expected solution.\n\nAgent Code Executor implemented the exact same steps in Python code and executed it. The execution of the Python code also resulted in a son's age of 34, which confirms the accuracy of the algebraic solution.\n\nThe consistent results between the algebraic and code solutions signified the son's age as 34 years. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND (34)**"
