Since a week has 7 days, and he earns $30 a day, this would be 7*30 = $210. \n\n2. You mentioned that he babysat for $0, this means it does not contribute to his earnings.\n\n3. Lastly, deduct the total he spent on groceries and other necessities from his earnings. He spent a total of $100, so subtract this from $210(the total money he earned), and the result will be the amount of money he has left.\n\nLet's compute that."
