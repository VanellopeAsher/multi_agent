  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we should follow the next steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the computer setup by adding up the cost of each item that Elvira decided to purchase: the computer, the scanner, the CD burner, and the printer.\n2. Subtract the cost of these items from Elvira's total gifted money to find out how much she will have left for her new outfit.\n\nLet's get started:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost of the computer setup.\n    - Computer: €1090\n    - Scanner: €157\n    - CD burner: €74\n    - Printer: €102 \n\nStep 2: Subtract the total cost of the computer setup from the gifted money.\n  \nSo, the remaining money will be Elvira's budget minus the total cost of items. This remaining money is the amount she can spend on her new outfit."

This is the amount left that Elvira can spend on her outfit. \n\nFirst, Agent Problem Solver formulated a sound step-by-step plan to solve the problem. His strategy was to calculate the total cost of the computer setup and subtract it from the total budget Elvira had received for her birthday. The remaining amount would be what Elvira has left to spend on her outfit. \n\nNext, Agent Code Executor converted these steps into Python code and executed it to produce the numerical result. \n\nSince both solutions reflect the same logic and produce consistent results, the final verified solution is:\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: €77"
