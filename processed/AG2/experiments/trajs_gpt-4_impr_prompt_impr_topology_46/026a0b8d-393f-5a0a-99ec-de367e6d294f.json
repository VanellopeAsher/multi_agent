      "content": "Alright! To solve this problem, we will use a basic Algebraic approach since we know prices of each packet, the total amount spent, and the amount of one type of packet.\n\nHere are the steps involved to solve this problem:\n\n1. Let's denote the number of tomato packets with the symbol T.\n2. As we know, she has 80 packets of celery seeds and each costs $30, the total spent on celery seeds is 80 * $30 = $2400.\n3. She spent a total of $3200 for both types of seeds. So the amount she used to buy the tomato seeds packets is $3200 - $2400 = $800.\n4. Since each packet of tomato seeds costs $40, the number of tomato seeds packets (T) she bought is derived from the division of the amount spent on tomato seeds packets by the price of each packet.\n5. Therefore, T = $800/$40.\n\nFinally, calculate the value of T following step 5 above. This will give you the number of tomato seeds packets Mrs. Rylan bought."

The algebraic approach and Python code solution presented by Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor have been logically and practically validated. A total of $3200 was spent, with $2400 spent on celery seeds and the remaining $800 allocated for tomato seeds. Hence, taking into consideration the cost of a single tomato seed packet, we find that she purchased 20 packets of tomato seeds. This conclusion is accurately supported by the code execution."
