According to the problem, Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam, so H = S + 80.\n3. They also share a total of 200 feet of fence, so S + H = 200.\n4. We can replace H in the second equation with S + 80 from the first equation, and we get S + (S + 80) = 200.\n5. Solve for S.\n6. The value of S gives the amount of fence left for Sam."
