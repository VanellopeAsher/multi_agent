Multiply that cost by the number of jars to find the total cost of ingredients for 10 jars.\n3. Determine the total selling price of 10 jars.\n4. Subtract the total cost from the total sales to find the profit.\n \nLet's go step by step.\n\nStep 1:  \n    Cost of passion fruit for one jar: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12  \n    Cost of jackfruit for one jar: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12  \n    Cost of honey for one jar: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20  \n    So, the total cost of ingredients to prepare one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44  \n\nStep 2:\n    The total cost of ingredients to make 10 jars = $44/jar * 10 jars = $440\n\nStep 3: \n    The total selling price for 10 jars = $50/jar * 10 jars = $500\n\nStep 4:\n    The profit from selling 10 jars = Total selling price - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60\n    \nHence, Tim earns a profit of $60 from selling 10 jars of this blend."
