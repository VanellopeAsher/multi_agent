      "content": "Looking at the expenses, Madeline incurs the following costs in a month:\n\n- Food: $25 per week. Since there are typically 4 weeks in a month, this makes a monthly food expense of $25 * 4 = $100.\n- Treats: $20 per month.\n- Medicine: $100 per month.\n- Special Shampoo: $15 per month.\n- Toys: $10 every two months. Since this is a bi-monthly expense, the effective monthly cost for toys is $10/2 = $5.\n\nAdding these up, we get the total monthly cost as follows:\n$100 (Food) + $20 (Treats) + $100 (Medicine) + $15 (Shampoo) + $5 (Toys) = $240.\n\nTo find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12 months), giving us $240 * 12 = $2880.\n\nSo, Madeline spends $2880 on her dog per year."

Finally, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 to find the total yearly cost. \n\n```python\n# Monthly costs\nfood_cost_per_week = 25\nweeks_per_month = 4\nfood_cost_per_month = food_cost_per_week * weeks_per_month\n\ntreats_cost_per_month = 20\nmedicine_cost_per_month = 100\nshampoo_cost_per_month = 15\n\ntoys_cost_per_two_months = 10\ntoys_cost_per_month = toys_cost_per_two_months / 2\n\n# With all per month costs we calculate total per month cost\ntotal_monthly_cost = (\n    food_cost_per_month\n    + treats_cost_per_month\n    + medicine_cost_per_month\n    + shampoo_cost_per_month\n    + toys_cost_per_month\n)\n\n# calculate total yearly cost\nmonths_per_year = 12\ntotal_yearly_cost = total_monthly_cost * months_per_year\n\nprint(total_yearly_cost)\n```\nThis Python code will provide the total yearly cost Madeline spends on her dog."
