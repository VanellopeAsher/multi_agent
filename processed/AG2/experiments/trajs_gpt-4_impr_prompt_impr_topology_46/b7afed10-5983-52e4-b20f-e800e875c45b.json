Add up the total distance run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since he ran 3.5 miles on each of these days, this total would be 3.5 miles * 3 = 10.5 miles.\n2. Add up the total distance run on Tuesday and Thursday. Since he ran 5.5 miles on each of these days, this total would be 5.5 miles * 2 = 11 miles.\n3. Add the total distance of the two sets of days to get the total miles ran for the week = 10.5 miles + 11 miles = 21.5 miles.\n\nTherefore, Sam ran a total of 21.5 miles this week."
