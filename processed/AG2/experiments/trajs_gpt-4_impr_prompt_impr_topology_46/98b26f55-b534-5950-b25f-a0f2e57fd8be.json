He could potentially earn money during this time by working. \n\nTo calculate how much money Jordan could earn in a week if he spent his video game time working instead, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total hours he spends playing video games in a week.\n2. Multiply this by his hourly wage.\n\nLet me write up the Python code for these calculations.\n```python\n# Hours spent on video games per day\nvideo_game_hours_per_day = 3 \n\n# Days in a week\ndays_in_a_week = 7\n\n# Hourly wage\nhourly_wage = 10\n\n# Calculate total video game hours in a week\ntotal_video_game_hours = video_game_hours_per_day * days_in_a_week\n\n# Calculate potential earnings\npotential_earnings = total_video_game_hours * hourly_wage \n\nprint(potential_earnings)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

They correctly identified the steps as calculating the total hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week and then multiplying this by his hourly wage to get potential earnings.\n\nAccording to the code output, Jordan would earn $210 if he spent his video game time working instead.\n\nBoth agents have proposed the same solution and the calculation matches the information given in the problem statement. I agree with their solutions.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{210}**. Jordan would earn $210 in a week if he spent his video game time working instead."
