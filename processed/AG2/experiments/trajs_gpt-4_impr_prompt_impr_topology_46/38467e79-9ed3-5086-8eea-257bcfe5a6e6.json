From the problem, we know that the number of students who do not have desktop computers represents one-third of the total student population.\n2. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'.\n3. So, the problem translates to 1/3 * x = 30\n4. We can solve for 'x' by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3.\n5. After that operation, we find that 'x' equals to 90, meaning there are 90 students in that grade level."

      "content": "Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor used the correct approach to calculate the total number of students. They correctly identified that if two-thirds of students have a desktop computer, then one-third do not. So, the number of students who do not have a desktop computer (30) makes up one-third of the total number of students. Therefore, to get the total number of students, they multiplied the known one-third (30 students) by 3, yielding a total of 90 students.\n\nI can confirm that the solution and the Python execution are correct. The total number of students at that grade level is indeed 90. Excellent work, everyone."

With your confirmation, we can definitively say that the solution to the problem is there are 90 students at the grade level. \n\nThe steps we implemented to arrive at the solution not only solve the current problem but also provide a blueprint that can be used to solve similar problems in the future.\n\nLet's keep up the good teamwork!"
