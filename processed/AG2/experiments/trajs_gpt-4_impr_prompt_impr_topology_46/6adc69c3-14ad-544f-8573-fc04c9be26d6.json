Moreover, we know that each original piece was cut into 5 pieces (so 5*5 cm is the length of each original piece after the first cut)\n3. Finally, we know that the whole ribbon was cut into 4 equal parts initially, so the length of the ribbon in cms is 4 * (5*5).\n4. Let's do the multiplication to have a final solution."
