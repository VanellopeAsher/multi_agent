Find the total height of the heels for women wearing 4.5-inch heels: Multiply 4.5 inches by the number of women wearing these heels.\n2. Find the total height of the heels for women wearing 2.5-inch heels: Multiply 2.5 inches by the number of women wearing these heels.\n3. Sum up the total heights from steps 1 and 2.\n4. Divide the total sum from step 3 by the total number of women at the party to find the average height of the heels.\n5. Report the average height."

This aligns with the step-by-step process outlined by the Problem Solver. \n\nThe steps were implemented correctly in the python code by first calculating the total height of 4.5-inch and 2.5-inch heels separately, then adding these totals to get the overall total height. This total was then divided by the total number of individuals (6) to yield the average heel height.\n\nIn conclusion, the average height of heels at this party is 3.5 inches."

The average height calculation was done by first separately calculating the total height of 4.5-inch heels and 2.5-inch heels, then adding them together to get the total height of all heels at the party, and finally dividing this total by the number of women at the party. \n\nTherefore, the average height of heels at this party is indeed 3.5 inches."
