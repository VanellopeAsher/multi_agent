      "content": "To solve this task:\n\n1. First, we determine the cost of a half-gallon jar of milk using the difference between the cost of a gallon jar and the $2.5 difference that was given. The cost of a half-gallon jar is therefore the cost of a gallon jar ($5.5) minus $2.5, which we'll refer to as `half_gallon_jar_cost`.\n\n2. Secondly, we calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of milk as the cost of a gallon jar multiplied by the number of gallon jars (`gallon_jar_cost * 10`).\n\n3. Then, we do the same for the half-gallon jars: we multiply the cost of a half-gallon jar by the number of these jars (`half_gallon_jar_cost * 16`).\n\n4. Finally, we find the total amount of money spent by adding the total cost for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps."
