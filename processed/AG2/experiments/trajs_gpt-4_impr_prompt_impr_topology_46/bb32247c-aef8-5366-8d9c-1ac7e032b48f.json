The information provided in the problem states \"several inches tall,\" which is non-specific and ambiguous. \n\nThe height after the second week is dependent on this precise first week's height because it \"doubled\" in size. Without this specific information, the overall answer cannot be calculated. \n\nI would suggest to consider revising the question to supply more specific numbers allowing a complete solution."
