      "content": "Let's approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Compute the cost for the flowers in a single basket by summing the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines. From the given problem, we know that Katherine wants to place 30 petunias priced at $3.00 each and 20 sweet potato vines priced at $2.50 each in every hanging basket. As a result, the total cost of the flowers for one basket can be calculated as:\n   `(30 * price of one petunia) + (20 * price of one sweet potato vine)`\n\n2. To obtain the total cost for all 50 baskets, we must multiply the cost of one basket by the total number of baskets. Hence,\n   `Cost for all baskets = 50 * cost of one basket` \n\nBy inserting the given values and solving, we will get the total cost Katherine will spend filling all 50 hanging baskets."

Both agents agree on the method to calculate the total cost that Katherine will spend to fill all the hanging baskets.\n\nThe calculation process is summarized as follows:\n1. Compute the total cost of the flowers for one basket: 30 petunias * $3.00/petunia + 20 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine.\n2. Multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets to find the total cost: Cost_one_basket * 50.\n\nAgent Code Executor's Python code executed successfully and returned 7000.0.
