In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Which means, Collins got 700 (same as others) + 150 (extra) = 850 corn chips.\n\nTo find the total number of corn chips, we add what Collins got to the total of what Amora and Lainey got. \n\nSo, the total number of corn chips would be 1400 (Amora and Lainey's total) + 850 (Collins) = 2250 corn chips. \n\nSo altogether, there were 2250 corn chips."
