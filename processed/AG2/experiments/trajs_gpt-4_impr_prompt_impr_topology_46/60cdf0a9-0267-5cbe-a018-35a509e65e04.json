In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

She got 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box to get the total crayons: total crayons = 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box.\n\nSince she mixed 8 crayon pieces to make a single crayon muffin, divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayon pieces in a muffin to find the total number of muffins: total muffins = total crayons / 8 crayons/muffin.\n\nThen, divide the total amount of money she made by the total number of crayon muffins to determine the price of each crayon muffin: price/muffin = total money / total muffins. \n\nThis will calculate the price for each crayon muffin."
