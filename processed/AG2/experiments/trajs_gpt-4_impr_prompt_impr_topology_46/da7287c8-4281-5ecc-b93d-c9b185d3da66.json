The total money made from milkshake sales can be calculated by multiplying the number of milkshakes sold (6) by the price per milkshake ($5.50).\n- Calculate the earnings for the burgers: Terry sold 9 burger platters for $11.5 each. The total earnings for the burgers can be calculated by multiplying the number of burger platters sold (9) by the cost of one burger platter ($11.5).\n- Calculate the earnings for the sodas: Terry sold half of 40 (=20) sodas for $1.50 each. We calculate the total earnings from soda by multiplying the number of sodas sold (20) by the price per soda ($1.50).\n- Finally, add up the total earnings for all the items to get Terry's total earnings."

It correctly calculates the total earnings from each item - milkshakes, burgers and sodas and then sums them up to get Terry's total earnings. \n\nBut the Agent Code Executor has not provided the actual result of the sum, presumably because they don't have the ability to actually execute Python code to calculate the sum. \n\nLet's calculate the total based on the steps provided:\n\n- Earnings from milkshakes: 6 * $5.50 = $33\n- Earnings from burgers: 9 * $11.5 = $103.5\n- Earnings from sodas: 20 * $1.50 = $30\n\nTotal earnings = Earnings from milkshakes + Earnings from burgers + Earnings from sodas = $33 + $103.5 + $30 = $166.5\n\nSo, Terry makes a total of $166.5.\n  \nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{166.5}."
