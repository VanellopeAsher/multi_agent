  "problem": "Tim is a skilled mixologist who specializes in creating a unique honey and jam blend. To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

This means that, after selling 10 jars of his special blend for $50 each, the total profit amounts to $60.\n\nThis calculation takes into account the cost for the passion fruit, jackfruit, and special honey - all of which are the raw ingredients needed to create one jar of the blend. The solution also notes that the secret ingredient, water, doesn't contribute to the direct cost of production. Thus, the profits are as stated above.\n\nJob well done, team."
