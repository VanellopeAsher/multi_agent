Today, Rick killed \"3*(c-3)\" wolves and \"(c-3)\" cougars.\n\n\nSo, to find the total number of animals Rick killed, we sum the wolves and cougars from both days:\n\n\nInitial number of animals = Wolves last night + Cougars last night = 10 + c\nNew number of animals = Wolves today + Cougars today = 3*(c-3) + c-3 \n\nSumming these up gives the total animals\n\nTotal animals = Initial number of animals + New number of animals = 10 + c + 3*(c-3) + c - 3 \n\nWe don't know the exact number of cougars that Rick killed the previous night (represented as \"c\" in our formula), so we will need additional information to find a concrete answer. Without that, we can only provide a formula for the total number of animals based on the value of \"c\"."

To solve for the number of animals Rick killed, we would uncover the number of cougars \"c\" killed the previous night, which we could substitute into the function and then compute.\n\nHowever, since the question doesn't specify how many cougars \"c\" were killed the previous night, we're left with the function as the solution.\n\nLet's go ahead and write the Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the symbol c \nc = symbols('c')\n\n# Number of animals killed yesterday\nanimals_yesterday = 10 + c\n\n# Number of animals killed today\nanimals_today = 3*(c - 3) + (c - 3)\n\n# Total animals\ntotal_animals = simplify(animals_yesterday + animals_today)\n\nprint(total_animals)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

Here, \"c\" represents the number of cougars Rick killed on the first day. Without the exact value of \"c\", we cannot calculate a definitive number of total animals killed. Further information would be needed to pinpoint this number. \n\nThe final formula indicates that, for each cougar Rick killed on the first day, he would kill five animals in total across the two days (4 on the first day from wolves and the cougar itself, and another wolf on the second day), with an additional reduction of two animals which represents the reduction in the number of cougars on the second day.\n\nIn conclusion, we need the exact number of cougars Rick killed on the first day for an exact answer. However, even without that, we have a formula that tells us how the number of animals Rick killed changes based on the number of cougars hunted on the first day."

      "content": "Indeed, we've done our best with the information provided. The final formula \"5*c - 2\" indicates that the total number of animals Rick killed depends on the number of cougars he killed on the first night. \n\nThe formula suggests that for every cougar killed the first night, Rick killed five animals in two days, minus an offset of two. This offset is because Rick killed three fewer cougars in the second day than the first day.\n\nAgain, we would need the exact number of cougars killed by Rick on the first night (which the problem doesn't tell us) to calculate the total number of animals that Rick killed. \n\nMeanwhile, the formula \"5*c - 2\" gives us a precise mathematical relationship among these quantities depending on the number of cougars killed on the first night."

The number of animals Rick killed can be expressed as a function of the number of cougars killed on the first day, which wasn't provided in the problem. Hence, an exact, numerical answer is not possible based on the given information.
