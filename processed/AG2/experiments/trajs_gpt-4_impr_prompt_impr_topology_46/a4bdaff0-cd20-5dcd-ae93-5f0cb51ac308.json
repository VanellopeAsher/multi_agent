Mortgage minimum payment: $5000/month\n\nWe sum these amounts to find the total minimum debt payment per month.\n\nNow, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add this to the total minimum payment.\n\nFinally, to determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12, as there are 12 months in a year.\n\nLet's do these calculations."

The executable code successfully calculated the total annual payment as $180000. \n\nSo, based on both solutions, we can conclude that if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on all her debts every month, she will pay $180000 in a year."
