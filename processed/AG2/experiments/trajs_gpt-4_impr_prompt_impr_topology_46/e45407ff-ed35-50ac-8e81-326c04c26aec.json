From there, I used the clues about the cognac's cost and quantity to determine the total cost of the cognac. The sum of these two costs gave me the total spend. I believe these steps to be a clear and straightforward way to approach this problem. \n\nWould anybody like to add to this or propose a different approach?"

The problem gave us direct relationships between the cost and quantity of scotch and cognac which made creating equations straightforward. Thus, the most optimal solution was to directly calculate the cost per bottle of each drink, multiply each by the appropriate quantity, and sum the results. This approach is direct, clear, and easy to follow. Any other approach would probably make a simple problem unnecessarily complicated."
