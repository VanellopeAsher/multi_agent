Then, we can divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts.\n\nHere's the plan we can follow to solve this problem:\n1. Find the total number of gifts by adding the number of gifts for family, friends and teachers.\n2. Divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts to calculate the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow.\n\nNow let's follow this plan and write our Python code."
