So, Richard has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 cherries.\n\nGiven that Robert, Jerry, and Richard together share 6000 cherries, and we know that Robert and Richard together have 3000 + 2000 = 5000 cherries. Therefore, Jerry has 6000 - 5000 = 1000 cherries.\n\nFinally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, subtract Jerry’s amount of cherries from Robert’s. \n\nThat is, Robert (3000) - Jerry (1000) = 2000. \n\nSo, Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry."
