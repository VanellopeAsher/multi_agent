In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Solution step by step: \n\n1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.\n2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. This leaves us with 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.\n3. Then, 5 times as many people as the ones who got off get on. Since 8 people got off, then 8 * 5 = 40 people get on the bus. The total number of passengers on the bus after this will be 40 (current passengers) + 40 (new passengers) = 80 passengers.\n4. Two people who just got on decide to get off again. This reduces the number of passengers to 80 - 2 = 78 passengers.\n5. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. This leaves us with 78 - 21 = 57 passengers.\n6. Then, 3 times fewer passengers as the ones who got off get on. Since 21 people got off, then 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. The total number of passengers on the bus after this will be 57 (current passengers) + 7 (new passengers) = 64 passengers.\n\nSo, the total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 64."
