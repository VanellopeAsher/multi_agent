In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the total running hours\nGiven that John runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, the total hours he runs per week is: 3 (first day) + 1.5 (second day) + 1.5 (third day) = 6 hours\n\nStep 2: Compute his speed\nSince speed is calculated as distance divided by time, John's running speed would be: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles/hour.\n\nPlease note that the resting time is not included in the calculation of speed because speed is related to active moving time, not rest time."

      "content": "Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor proposed the same solution and derived the same result. They calculated the total running time as the sum of John's running hours for 3 days a week. The speed was then calculated as the total distance divided by total time. Their solutions are logical as the speed of motion is typically calculated as distance over time.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is that John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10}** miles per hour."
