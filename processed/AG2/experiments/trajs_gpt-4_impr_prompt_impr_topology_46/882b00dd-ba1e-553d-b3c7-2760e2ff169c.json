This means he makes $11.50 per hour.\n\n2. Sally initially earns $0.50 more than Billy did, which is $10.50 per hour. After two months, she got a raise of $0.50, which means she now makes $11.00 per hour. \n\n3. Each of them worked 20 hours. \n\nTo find out how much more Billy will earn than Sally, we need to multiply their hourly rates by the number of hours they will work, and then subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's. \n\nLet's proceed to make this calculation."
