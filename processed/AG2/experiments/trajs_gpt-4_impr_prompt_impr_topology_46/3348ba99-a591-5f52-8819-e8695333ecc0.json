      "content": "Given data:\n\n- Mark's rate is 0.5 sets of ten questions per hour. This means in an hour, Mark completes 0.5 sets, which is equivalent to 5 questions.\n- On the first day, Mark had 0.8 sets of ten hours to complete the test, which means he had 0.8 * 10 = 8 hours.\n- On the second day, Mark had 0.6 sets of ten hours to complete the test, which means he had 0.6 * 10 = 6 hours.\n    \nTo find the total number of sets left incomplete, we follow these steps:\n\n1. First, calculate the total number of sets which Mark was able to complete given the given hours and rate, for both the first test and the second test separately.\n2. Subtract the number of sets he completed from the total number of sets given in the test.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\nFor the first day:\n\n- Mark had 8 hours to answer the questions at a rate of 0.5 sets of ten questions per hour. Hence, the total number of sets he completed on the first day is 8 hours * 0.5 sets/hour = 4 sets.\n- The first day's test consisted of 7.5 sets of ten questions. Hence, the sets left incomplete on the first day = 7.5 sets - 4 sets = 3.5 sets.\n\nFor the second day:\n\n- Mark had 6 hours to answer the questions at the same rate of 0.5 sets/hour. Hence, the total number of sets he completed on the second day is 6 hours * 0.5 sets/hour = 3 sets.\n- The second day's test consisted of 10 sets of ten questions. Hence, the sets left incomplete on the second day = 10 sets - 3 sets = 7 sets.\n\nFinally,\n\n- The total number of sets left incomplete is the sum of the sets left incomplete on both days, which is 3.5 sets + 7 sets = 10.5 sets. \n\nSo, Mark left 10.5 sets of ten questions incomplete."
