He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

      "content": "First, let's understand the problem and identify all the facts:\n\n1. Number of current clients = 3\n2. Number of potential clients = 5\n3. Thus, total number of clients = 3+5=8\n4. Each client's house requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths.\n5. Cost of bleach = $2 per bottle\n6. Total income per week = $92\n7. Weekly profit = $20\n\nThe profit is calculated as the total income minus the total expenses. Thus, total expenses = total income - profit.\n\nNow, to calculate the cost of the pack of cloths:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total income and total expenses\nThe total expenses = total income - profit,\nSo, total expenses = $92 - $20 = $72\n\nStep 2: Compute the cost of the bleach\nEach client's house requires two bottles of bleach. Therefore, for all the clients, the total cost of bleach = number of clients * bottles of bleach per client * cost of one bleach bottle,\nSo, the total cost of bleach = 8 * 2 * $2 = $32\n\nStep 3: Compute the cost of cloths\nThe cost of cloths would be the total expenses minus the cost of the bleach,\nSo, cost of the cloths = total expenses - cost of bleach,\nThus, cost of cloths = $72 - $32\n\nStep 4: Determine the cost of a pack of cloths\nEach clientâ€™s house needs a pack of cloths. Therefore, the cost of each pack = total cost of cloths / number of clients.\n\nSummarizing these steps:\n\n1. Calculate total expenses by subtracting profit from total income ($92 - $20).\n2. Compute the total cost of bleach for all clients = number of clients * bottles of bleach per client * cost of one bottle of bleach (8 * 2 * $2).\n3. Find out the total cost of cloths = total expenses - cost of bleach.\n4. Find the cost of each pack of cloths = total cost of cloths / number of clients."
