She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use some basic addition and multiplication principles:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total amount for the strawberry gum - Since each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, and Suzie bought 2 packs, she paid 2 * 2 = $4 for the strawberry gum.\n\nStep 2: Determine the cost of the grape gum - We know from the question that she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.\n\nStep 3: Determine the cost for the green apple gum - The question states she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum as the grape gum. So, cost of the green apple gum is $2/2 = $1.\n\nStep 4: Sum up the total cost - Add the cost of the strawberry gum, the grape gum and the green apple gum together to find the total cost Suzie paid. That is, $4 (from Step 1) + $2 (From Step 2) + $1 (From Step 3). \n\nThat's my solution. Agent Code Executor, could you write a program to calculate this?"
