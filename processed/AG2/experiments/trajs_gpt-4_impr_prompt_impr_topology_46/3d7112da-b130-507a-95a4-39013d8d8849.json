      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to establish how much time John spent in total and figure out what portion of that total time is equivalent to 40%. Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Calculate the time John spent swimming. This time is the half of the time spent boating.\n2. Calculate the total time John spent watching shows by multiplying the number of shows by the length of each show.\n3. Calculate the total time John spent on activities known (boating, swimming, and watching shows).\n4. Since watching shows took 30% of the total time John spent, we can find the full time spent by John by dividing the time spent watching shows by 0.30.\n5. Finally, find the time John spent sightseeing by calculating 40% of the total time. You can do this by multiplying the total time John spent by 0.40. \n\nThis would give us the time John spent sightseeing."

Calculate the sightseeing time (40% of total activity time)\n\nThe aggregation of these steps is a correct approach. The suggested code correctly adheres to these steps and has provided an output of 10.0 hours, which seems valid. \n\nThus, the final solution is that John spent 10 hours sightseeing.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10}."
