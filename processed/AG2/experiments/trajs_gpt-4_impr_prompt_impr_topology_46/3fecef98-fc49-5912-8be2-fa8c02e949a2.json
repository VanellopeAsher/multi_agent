      "content": "To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to determine the size of the pieces for the comforter and the duvet cover then add these numbers up. \n\nHere is a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide but the fabric for the comforter needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. Therefore, each piece of fabric for the comforter should be 8 feet long (6+2) and 10 feet wide (8+2). \n\n2. To obtain the area of a rectangle (which the fabric for the comforter is), we multiply the length by the width. For the comforter, this will be 8 feet (length) times 10 feet (width), or 80 square feet.\n\n3. Since Jim needs two pieces of this size for the comforter, he will need a total of 2*80 = 160 square feet for the comforter.\n\n4. The duvet cover is a rectangle of 9 feet long by 11 feet wide. The size (area) of the fabric needed will therefore be 9 (length) times 11 (width) or 99 square feet.\n\n5. To get the overall total, add the square footage for the comforter to that for the duvet cover: 160 square feet (comforter) + 99 square feet (duvet cover) = 259 square feet.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Jim needs 259 square feet of fabric."

      "content": "Let's implement the solution using Python.\n\nWe know:\n\n- The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.\n- Comforter needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So,    each piece will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.\n- Duvet cover is 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.\n\nTo calculate the total fabric needed:\n\n- Calculate the area of one piece of comforter: 8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet.\n- Jim needs 2 pieces of that size for the comforter, so multiply 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.\n- Calculate the area for the duvet cover: 9 feet (length) * 11 feet (width) = 99 square feet.\n- Add up the total fabric needed for both the comforter and the duvet cover: 160 square feet + 99 square feet = 259 square feet.\n\nThe code below demonstrates this calculation. It first computes the area needed for one or two parts of the composition (the comforter and duvet cover) and then sums these two values to get the total area needed. \n\n```python\n# Compute the area of one fabric piece for the comforter\nlength_comforter = 6 + 2\nwidth_comforter = 8 + 2\narea_one_piece_comforter = length_comforter * width_comforter\n\n# Jim needs two pieces of that size\narea_comforter = 2 * area_one_piece_comforter\n\n# Compute the area of the duvet cover\nlength_duvet = 9\nwidth_duvet = 11\narea_duvet = length_duvet * width_duvet\n\n# Total fabric needed\ntotal_area_needed = area_comforter + area_duvet\ntotal_area_needed\n```\n\nExecuting the code above will give us the total area of fabric that Jim needs to buy."
