      "content": "The problem is a cost comparison problem between two options, depending on the number of guests at the party.\n\n1. Formulate the cost equation for the first venue: The first venue charges a flat fee of $2000, but food is not included and Mark estimates that it costs $50 per person. Therefore, the total cost of hosting the party at this venue can be represented as c1 = 2000 + 50n, where n is the number of guests.\n\n2. Formulate the cost equation for the second venue: The second venue charges $250 per person, and this fee includes the cost of food as well. Therefore, the total cost of hosting the party at this venue can be represented as c2 = 250n.\n\n3. Set the two equations equal to each other to find the number of guests, n, at which the two venues would cost the same: 2000 + 50n = 250n\n\n4. Solve the above equation for n.\n\n5. Finally, the calculated number of guests, n, would be the minimum number of guests necessary for the cost of the two venues to be the same. Open fractions and decimals should be rounded up, as the number of guests should always be an integer."

We will define the variables and the equations, and then we will solve it.\n\nNote: Agent_Problem_Solver mentioned rounding up to the nearest whole number. That could be done using the math.ceil() function after solving for 'n'. This is because one cannot invite a fraction of a person to a party. The minimum number of guests for which the price is equal is the first whole number greater than or equal to 'n'."
