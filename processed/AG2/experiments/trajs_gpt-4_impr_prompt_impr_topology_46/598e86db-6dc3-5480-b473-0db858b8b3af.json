      "content": "To solve this problem, we will go through the following steps: \n\n1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. This includes 31 days in March and 19 days in April, yielding 50 days in total.\n\n2. Calculate the number of days Billy takes off. According to the problem, he takes off 20% of the total days (50 days). So, he took 50 * 20% = 10 days off.\n\n3. Determine the number of days Billy actually works. Deducting the days off from the total number of days yields: 50 days - 10 days = 40 days.\n\n4. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works. If he works 3 hours each day for 40 days, then he will have worked 3 * 40 = 120 hours.\n\n5. Finally, calculate the number of people Billy helps per hour. Since he helped 240 people in total across 120 hours, he helped 240 / 120 = 2 people per hour.\n\nThus, Billy is able to assist 2 people per hour."

So total days = 31 + 19 = 50\n\n2. Billy takes 20% of these days off. So the number of days he takes off = 20/100 * 50 = 10 days\n\n3. The number of days Billy actually works = Total days - Days off = 50 -10 = 40 days\n\n4. Billy works 3 hours a day. So total hours he works = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours\n\n5. He helps 240 people in this time. So people he helps per hour = total people / total hours = 240 / 120 = 2\n\nSo, Billy helps 2 people per hour.\n\nLet's calculate this in python."
