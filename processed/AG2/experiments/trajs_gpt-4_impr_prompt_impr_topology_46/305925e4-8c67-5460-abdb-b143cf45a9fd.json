For the question, assume Joey scored X points in his turn.\n4. Marcy scored 10 points in her turn, so her score after her turn became 225 + 10 = 235 points.\n5. Now the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score indicates how much Joey is winning. So, Joey's score after his turn should be more than Marcy's score after her turn. \n6. Set up an equation with the assumed Joey's score and Marcy's final score, such that X + 214 = 235.\n7. The solution to this equation is the score Joey made in his turn.\n8. Verify that Joey's final score is more than Marcy's final score to confirm he is winning.\n\n\nNote: Only a positive solution is acceptable since you can't score negative points in Scrabble. If the solution is negative, then Joey is not winning.\n \nLet’s calculate!"

They both outlined clear, logical steps to obtain the solution, which are:\n\n1. Calculating Marcy's total score after she scores 10 points, which is 225 (her initial score) + 10 = 235 points.\n2. Determining the score Joey needs to get, which is Marcy's total score minus Joey's initial score, hence 235 - 214 = 21 points.\n3. Confirming Joey is winning by checking that the score he needs is positive, which it is.\n\nConsidering these steps and the results obtained by both agents, the most appropriate solution for the problem is that Joey is winning by 21 points.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{21}"
