You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.

The second set has 3 times the size of the first set.\n3. The third set has one-fourth (1/4) the size of the first set.\n4. The fourth set has 125 pieces more than the first set.\n\nWe are to find the total number of blocks he picks up, which is the sum of the sizes of all the sets.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Python code\n\nfirst_set = 500\nsecond_set = 3 * first_set\nthird_set = first_set / 4\nfourth_set = first_set + 125\n\ntotal_blocks = first_set + second_set + third_set + fourth_set\n\nprint(total_blocks)\n```"
