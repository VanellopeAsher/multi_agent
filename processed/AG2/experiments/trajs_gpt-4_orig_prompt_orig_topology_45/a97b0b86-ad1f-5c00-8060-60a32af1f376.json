You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

      "content": "Key Idea: \n\nWe can solve this problem by taking the total paid by Marie $52.5, then subtracting the costs of the chicken meal, packs of milk, and apples. The remaining amount will be the cost of the pizzas. To find out the number of pizzas, we simply divide this cost by the price of each pizza.\n\nHere are the steps in Python:\n\n1. Store the total paid by Marie in a variable.\n2. Subtract the cost of the chicken meal from the total.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the packs of milk and apples from the remaining total.\n4. Divide the remaining total by the cost of each pizza to find out the number of pizzas ordered.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the prices and quantities of each item\nchicken_meal_price = 12\nmilk_price = 3.5\nnum_milk = 5\napple_price = 1.5\nnum_apples = 4\npizza_price = 8.5\n\n# define the total paid by Marie\ntotal_paid = 52.5\n\n# calculate and print the number of pizzas\npizza_cost = total_paid - (chicken_meal_price + milk_price * num_milk + apple_price * num_apples)\nnum_pizzas = pizza_cost / pizza_price\nprint(num_pizzas)\n```\n\nYou can run this code to get the number of pizzas ordered by Marie."
