You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nLet's denote the single dose of the first medicine as `x`. According to the problem, the second medicine has `3x` in the proportional dose.  Hence, each dosage combines `x + 3x = 4x`. If 4x equals 448 mL in 8 doses, then a single dose contains `448/8 = 56` mL. Solve the equation `4x = 56` to find x.\n\nLet us solve this problem with Python using the sympy package. Sympy provides a straightforward way to solve linear equations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\neq = Eq(4*x, 56)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(eq, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The amount of the first medicine in each dose is {solution[0]} mL.\")\n```"
