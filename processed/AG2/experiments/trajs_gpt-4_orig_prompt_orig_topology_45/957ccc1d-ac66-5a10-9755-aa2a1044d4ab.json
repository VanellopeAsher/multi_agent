You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th.

Convert Andy's weight loss goal from pounds to calories. 1 pound = 3500 calories. Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn 30*3500 calories. \n2. Calculate the number of days Andy has to lose weight. He has from January 1st to July 19th to reach his goal.\n3. Divide the total amount of calories Andy needs to burn by the number of days he has to lose weight. This will give us his daily calorie deficit goal. \n\nLet's write our Python program to implement these steps."
