You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSamwell owns an appliance store.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nSamwell's TV sales can be calculated by subtracting the number of other types of TVs sold from the total number of TVs sold. To find the number of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs sold, we will calculate the fraction of the respective total for each. Subtracting these from the total will give us the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nHowever, in Python, regular division will give answers in decimal format. For fractions like one-fourth and one-eight, this can result in unnecessary precision loss. Therefore, we'll use the Fractions package in Python to accurately handle the fractions.\n\nSolution Code:\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ntotal_tvs = 40\n\n# Calculate sold TVs\nsmart_tvs = total_tvs * Fraction(1, 4)\nanalog_tvs = total_tvs * Fraction(1, 8)\nprojection_tvs = total_tvs * Fraction(1, 5)\n\n# Calculate sold OLED TVs\noled_tvs = total_tvs - (smart_tvs + analog_tvs + projection_tvs)\n\nprint(oled_tvs)\n```"
