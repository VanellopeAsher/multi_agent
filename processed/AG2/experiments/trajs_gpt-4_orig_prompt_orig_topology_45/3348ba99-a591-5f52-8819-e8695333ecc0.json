Today, he took another test of 10 sets of ten questions at the same rate. If Mark had 0.8 sets of ten hours to complete the first test and 0.6 sets of ten hours to complete the second one, how many sets of ten questions did he leave incomplete?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark took a test yesterday that consisted of 7.5 sets of ten questions.

So, the number of sets he could complete in a given duration would be:\n\nSets completed = Rate * Time\n\nThis can be calculated for both the tests and be subtracted from the total sets in the tests to find out the number of sets that were left incomplete.\n\nLet's code this in Python."
