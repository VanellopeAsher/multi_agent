You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Monday, a water tank measured 17 feet deep.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nFirst, we find the water level on Tuesday by adding Monday's depth to the extra rise on Tuesday. Then, we find Wednesday's depth by multiplying two-thirds of Tuesday's water level.\n\nSolution:\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the depth of water in the tank on Monday\nmonday_depth = 17\n\n# Define how much the water level rose on Tuesday\ntuesday_rise = 7\n\n# Compute the depth of water on Tuesday by adding Monday's depth and Tuesday's rise\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + tuesday_rise\n\n# Compute the depth of water on Wednesday by finding two thirds of Tuesday's depth\nwednesday_depth = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_depth\n\nprint(wednesday_depth)\n```\n\nHere, `Rational` function is used to represent exact fraction. `Rational(2, 3)` represents the fraction 2/3. We can simply multiply it with Tuesday's depth (a integer) to get the exact result."
