  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

      "content": "The key idea to solve the problem is to make use of the profit formula. We know that Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses. In this case, we have the total income and the profit, and we need to calculate the total expenses first. The total expenses would be the combined cost of cleaning supplies for all clients. Once we know the total expenses, we can work out the cost of the cloths.\n\nHere are the steps in Python:\n\nStep 1: Compute the total number of clients - which is current clients + potential clients.\n\nStep 2: Compute the total expenses using the formula Expenses = Income - Profit.\n\nStep 3: Find the total costs for the bleach for all clients.\n\nStep 4: Subtract the total costs for the bleach from the total expenses to find the total expenses for the cloths.\n\nStep 5: Compute the cost of each pack of cloths by dividing the total expenses for the cloths by the total number of clients.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# number of clients\nclients = 3 + 5\n\n# total income and profit\nincome = 92\nprofit = 20\n\n# expenses\nexpenses = income - profit\n\n# costs for bleach\nbleach_cost = 2 * clients * 2 # each client needs 2 bottles and each bottle costs $2\n\n# expenses for cloths\ncloths_expenses = expenses - bleach_cost\n\n# cost of each pack of cloths\ncloths_cost = cloths_expenses / clients\n\nprint(cloths_cost)\n```"
