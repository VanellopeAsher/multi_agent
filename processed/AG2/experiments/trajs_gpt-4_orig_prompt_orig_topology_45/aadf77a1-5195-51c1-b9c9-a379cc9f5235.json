If a small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric, a medium one is 4 square feet, and a large one is 6 square feet, and she used 8 medium and 6 large shirts, how many small shirts did she use to make the quilt?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

Once we have that, we can divide by the size of a small shirt to find out how many she used.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the total quilt size, and the sizes of each type of shirt\nquilt_size = 101\nsmall_shirt_size = 3\nmedium_shirt_size = 4\nlarge_shirt_size = 6\n\n# define the number of each type of shirt she used\nmedium_shirts_used = 8\nlarge_shirts_used = 6\n\n# calculate the total size of the medium and large shirts\nmedium_large_total = medium_shirt_size * medium_shirts_used + large_shirt_size * large_shirts_used\n\n# calculate the size of the small shirts used and divide by the size of a small shirt to find the number of small shirts used\nsmall_shirts_used = (quilt_size - medium_large_total) / small_shirt_size\n\nprint(small_shirts_used)\n```\n"
