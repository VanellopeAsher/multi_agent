You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

The total number of balloons they had initially is the product of the number of packs of balloons they filled up and the number of balloons per pack.\n\nIt's a simple calculation that can be solved directly with Python code.\n\nCase 1: \n\nHere are the steps in Python code.\nFirstly, I will set variables for the number of balloons per pack and the number of packs. I will be asking you how many packs of balloons they filled up. After you tell me the number of packs, I can calculate the total number of balloons initially. Then I subtract from this the number of balloons that are left to find the answer. \n```python\n# Your code\nballoons_per_pack = 30\n# Ask for the number of packs.\nballoons_left = 12\n```"
