For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "Key idea: Since Stephen lends $300 and pays back $25 per month for 11 months, we first find out how much he still owes her after these payments. For the twelfth month's payment, he needs to cover this remaining amount plus 2% interest on the money he owed. We don't include the $100 he plans to spend on collecting rare coins that month as this doesn't affect his repayments.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variables\ninitial_borrow = 300  # The initial amount Stephen borrowed\nmonthly_payment = 25  # The amount Stephen pays back each month\ninterest_rate = 0.02  # The interest rate as a decimal\n\n# calculate the total repayments made over the 11 months\ntotal_repayments = monthly_payment * 11\n\n# calculate the remaining amount owed\nremaining_amount = initial_borrow - total_repayments\n\n# calculate the interest on the money owed\ninterest = remaining_amount * interest_rate\n\n# calculate the total amount to be paid in the twelfth month\ntwelfth_month_payment = remaining_amount + interest\n\nprint(simplify(twelfth_month_payment))\n```\n\nPlease run this Python code and let me know the output."
