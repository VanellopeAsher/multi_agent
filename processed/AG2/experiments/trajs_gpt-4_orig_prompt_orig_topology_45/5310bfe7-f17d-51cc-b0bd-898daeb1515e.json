You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

We can solve this problem by finding out how many goals Mark and Anna scored and then adding these values along with Richie's goals.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of goals Richie scored\nrichie_goals = 90\n\n# Based on the problem, Mark scored 30 less than Richie\nmark_goals = richie_goals - 30\n\n# Anna scored 55 less than Richie\nanna_goals = richie_goals - 55\n\n# Define the total goals by adding the number of goals each teenager scored\ntotal_goals = richie_goals + mark_goals + anna_goals\n\n# Print the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers\nprint(total_goals)\n```"
