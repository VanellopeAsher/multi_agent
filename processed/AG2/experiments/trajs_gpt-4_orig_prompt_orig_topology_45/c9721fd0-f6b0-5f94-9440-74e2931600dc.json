You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts.

We first need to calculate the number of hours charged by rounding 2.25 hours up to the nearest whole number because Patty's Plumbing charges for each fraction of an hour. After that, we multiply the number of hours with the hourly rate, add the service fee and the cost of parts to get the total amount billed.\n\nHere is the python code that does that:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# define the variables\nservice_fee = 40\nhourly_rate = 35\nhours_worked = 2.25\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# calculate the number of hours charged\nhours_charged = math.ceil(hours_worked)\n\n# calculate the total amount\ntotal_amount = service_fee + (hourly_rate * hours_charged) + parts_cost\n\nprint(total_amount)\n```"
