  "problem": "Every month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Additionally, Madeline also buys a special shampoo for her dog that costs $15 per month and a toy that costs $10 every two months. If there are 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year, how much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to calculate the cost of each item per month, then multiply it by the number of months in a year. \n\nAs there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month will be 4 * weekly cost. \nThe cost of a toy per month is the cost of the toy divided by 2 because one toy is bought every two months.\nAfter we get the cost of each item per month, we add them up and then multiply by 12 to get the total yearly cost. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# Define the cost for each item\nweekly_food_cost = 25\nmonthly_treats_cost = 20\nmonthly_medicine_cost = 100\nmonthly_shampoo_cost = 15\nbi_monthly_toys_cost = 10\n\n# Calculate the monthly cost for each item\nmonthly_food_cost = weekly_food_cost * 4\nmonthly_toys_cost = bi_monthly_toys_cost / 2\n\n# Calculate total monthly cost\ntotal_monthly_cost = monthly_food_cost + monthly_treats_cost + monthly_medicine_cost + monthly_shampoo_cost + monthly_toys_cost\n\n# Calculate total yearly cost\ntotal_yearly_cost = total_monthly_cost * 12\n\n# Print the total yearly cost\nprint(total_yearly_cost)\n```\nAfter this code is executed, the output will be Madeline's total yearly cost for her dog."
