You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

This total sum will be divided by the cost of action figures from Sunday through Wednesday and the rest of the week to get the total number of action figures.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this:\n\n1. Calculate how much he spends each day.\n2. From Sunday through Wednesday (4 days), calculate the number of wooden action figures he can buy.\n3. For the rest of the week (3 days), calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy.\n4. Add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week."
