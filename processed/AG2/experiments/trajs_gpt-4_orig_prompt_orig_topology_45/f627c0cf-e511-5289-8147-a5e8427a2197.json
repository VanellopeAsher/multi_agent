You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark was unwell for a period of time, during which he lost 10 pounds per month.

Then we will multiply this number by 10 (the amount of weight Mark lost per month) and add this to his final weight of 70 pounds to find his initial weight.\n\nAssume Mark was unwell for `n` months. Since it's not stated in the problem, we can use an example number to demonstrate.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Assume Mark was unwell for 5 months, replace n with your desired value \nn = 5\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(70 + 10*n, 'Initial_weight') \ninitial_weight = solve(equation, 'Initial_weight')[0]\n\n# output the initial weight\nprint(\"Initial weight: \", initial_weight)\n\n```  \n\nReplace the 5 in `n = 5` with the actual number of months Mark was unwell to get the real initial weight."
