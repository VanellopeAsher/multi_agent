  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "First, let's calculate how much time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. We then add 5 breaks of 15 minutes each and 1 hour for lunch. This total is equal to 30% of the total time John spent on his vacation.\n\nBased on this information, we can set the equation:\n\n`0.30 * total_time = boating + swimming + shows + rests + lunch`\n\nWe can then calculate the total time and get the time John spent on sightseeing, which is 40% of his total time.\n\nWe write this process in the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Time (in minutes) that John spent on each activity\nboating = 6 * 60  # 6 hours\nswimming = (6 / 2) * 60  # Half of boating time\nshows = 3 * 2 * 60  # 3 shows, 2 hours each\nrests = 5 * 15  # 5 breaks, 15 minutes each\nlunch = 60  # 1 hour\n\nactivity_time_without_breaks = boating + swimming + shows\nactivity_time_with_breaks = activity_time_without_breaks + rests + lunch\n\ntotal_time = sp.Symbol('total_time')\nequation = sp.Eq(0.30 * total_time, activity_time_with_breaks)\n\n# Solve the equation for total_time\ntotal_time_solution = sp.solve(equation, total_time)[0]\n\nsightseeing = 0.40 * total_time_solution\n\n# Convert the sightseeing time to hours\nsightseeing_hours = sightseeing / 60\n\nprint(sightseeing_hours)\n```\n\nAfter running this Python code, you can get the answer."
