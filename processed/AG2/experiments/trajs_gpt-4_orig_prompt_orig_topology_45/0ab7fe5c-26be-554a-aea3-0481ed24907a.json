You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to calculate the number of tulips Jackson purchases and then divide it by the number of tulips per row. \n\nFirst, we calculate how many tulips Jackson buys: he buys 3.6 times of ten red tulips and 2.4 times of ten blue tulips. The total number of red tulips and blue tulips are calculated separately.\n\nThen, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row, and the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row. \n\nSince a row only contains a single color of tulip, the total number of rows would be the sum of the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips.\n\nNow, we can implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the number of tulips per purchase\nred_tulips_per_purchase = 10\nblue_tulips_per_purchase = 10\n\n# define the number of purchases\nred_purchases = 3.6\nblue_purchases = 2.4\n\n# calculate the total number of tulips purchased\ntotal_red_tulips = red_tulips_per_purchase * red_purchases\ntotal_blue_tulips = blue_tulips_per_purchase * blue_purchases\n\n# define the number of tulips per row\nred_tulips_per_row = 6\nblue_tulips_per_row = 8\n\n# calculate the number of rows\nred_rows = total_red_tulips / red_tulips_per_row\nblue_rows = total_blue_tulips / blue_tulips_per_row\n\n# calculate the total number of rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```"
