You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to realize that the height of the beanstalk is first multiplied by 2 and then 4 inches are added to it. \n\nI will now code this process in Python to calculate the final height. For this, it's important to know the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week.\n\nIt's not specified in the problem, so I'll call this initial height `x`. Please replace `x` in the code with the actual initial height once it's known.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# the height after the second week\nsecond_week_height = x * 2\n\n# the height after the third week\nthird_week_height = second_week_height + 4\n\nprint(third_week_height)\n```\n\nAfter getting the actual initial height `x`, replace it in the code and run the program again to get the final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks."
