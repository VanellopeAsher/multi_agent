You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThis problem is straightforward and hence falls into Case 1. We first identify the total hours worked each day, and then add them up to get the total hours worked over the 3 days.\n\nHere is how to solve it:\n\n```python\n# Tuesday hours\ntuesday_hours = 5\n\n# Wednesday hours (double of Tuesday)\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\n\n# Thursday hours (2 less than Wednesday)\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# Total hours\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nThis Python code will directly give the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days."
