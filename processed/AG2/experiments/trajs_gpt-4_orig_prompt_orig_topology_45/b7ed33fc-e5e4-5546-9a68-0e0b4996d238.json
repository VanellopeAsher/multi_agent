You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to interpret the given data properly and use simple arithmetic operations.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. A normal sudoku puzzle takes John 30 minutes. During this time, he drinks 1 bottle of water.\n2. An extreme sudoku puzzle takes John 3 times the time it takes to solve a normal puzzle. So the time taken is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.\n3. As he drinks 1 bottle of water every half hour, in 90 minutes he would drink 90 / 30 = 3 bottles of water.\n\nNow, let's write a Python code to calculate the result.\n\n```python\n# Time taken to solve a normal Sudoku puzzle\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30  # minutes\n\n# Rate of drinking water\nbottles_per_half_hour = 1  # bottles\n\n# Time taken to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle\nextreme_sudoku_time = normal_sudoku_time * 3  # minutes\n\n# Number of bottles drunk during an extreme Sudoku puzzle\nbottles_during_extreme_sudoku = (extreme_sudoku_time / normal_sudoku_time) * bottles_per_half_hour  # bottles\n\nprint(bottles_during_extreme_sudoku)\n```\nThe output will be the number of bottles of water that John drinks while solving an extreme Sudoku puzzle. This final result will be put in \\boxed{}."
