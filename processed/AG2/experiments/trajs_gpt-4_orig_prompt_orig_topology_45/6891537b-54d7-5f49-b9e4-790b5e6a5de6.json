  "problem": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nFirst, we calculate the total number of sports cards Miss Maria has by multiplying the number of decks and boxes by the number of cards in each respective deck and box. Next, we subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps and the number of cards Jane refuses from the total. Lastly, to obtain the total number students Ms. Maria has, we divide the remaining number of cards by the number of cards each student received.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate:\n\n```python\n# the total number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n# the total number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n# the total number of sports cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\n\n# the number of cards Miss Maria keeps\nkept_cards = 50\n# the number of cards Jane refuses\nrefused_cards = 10\n\n# the remaining cards to be given to students\nremaining_cards = total_cards - (kept_cards + refused_cards)\n\n# the number of students Maria has\nstudents = remaining_cards // 10\n\nprint(students)\n```"
