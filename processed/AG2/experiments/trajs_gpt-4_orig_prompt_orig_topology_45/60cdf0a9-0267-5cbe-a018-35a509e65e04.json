  "problem": "At the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces. The teacher agreed. Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she sold all her muffin crayons and made $36, how much each muffin crayon sells for?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

Then, calculate the price for each muffin crayon by dividing total sales by the number of muffin crayons.\n\nLet's solve the problem using Python:\n\n```python\n# total crayon boxes\ntotal_boxes = 3\n\n# total crayons in each box\ncrayons_in_box = 64\n\n# small crayon pieces to make one crayon muffin\npieces_per_muffin = 8\n\n# total sales\ntotal_sales = 36\n\n# calculate the total number of crayons\ntotal_crayons = total_boxes * crayons_in_box\n\n# calculate the number of crayon muffins\nmuffins = total_crayons // pieces_per_muffin\n\n# calculate the price of each muffin crayon\nprice_per_muffin = total_sales / muffins\n\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\nUse '//' for integer division in Python to have an integer result for number of muffins. Otherwise, it would have been a float number which is inappropriate as count of objects such as muffins."
