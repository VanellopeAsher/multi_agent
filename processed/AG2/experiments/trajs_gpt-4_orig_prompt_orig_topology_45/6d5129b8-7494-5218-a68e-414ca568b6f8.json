You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nTo determine Charmaine's age after 4 years, we must first compute her current age. Given that Charmaine will turn 16 in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16. This gives us her current age. To find out how old Charmaine will be after 4 years, we add 4 to her current age.\n\nSolution:\n```python\n# compute current age of Charmaine\ncurrent_age = 16 - 12\n\n# compute future age after 4 more years\nfuture_age = current_age + 4\n\nprint(future_age)\n```"
