You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is understanding that the total number of bandages at any time is equal to the total number of bandages they have at the beginning plus bandages ordered minus bandages used. We need to use this idea to form up our equation.\n\nLet's denote the number of bandages they used on the first day as x.\n\nThen we can form up the equation as follows:\n \n- On the first day, they started with 19 bandages, ordered one bulk pack of 50, and used x bandages. So the total number of bandages they had at the end of the first day is: 19 + 50 - x.\n- On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which is x-10. So the total number of bandages they had at the end of the second day is: 19 + 50 - x + ( - (x-10)), which simplifies to: 59 - x.\n- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 and used half a pack, i.e. 50/2 = 25. So the total number bandages they have at the end of the third day is: 59 - x + 2*50 - 25 = 134 - x.\n\nAccording to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can write 134 - x = 78.\n\nNow we have a simple equation to solve for x, which represents the number of bandages they used on the first day. \n\nLet's solve this equation. We can solve it directly using Python code."
