Following a day of intense rainfall, the water volume at the same location in the river becomes twice as much. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow at that point. What is the total volume of water flowing through that point of the river on the third day?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain moment, a river is flowing with a volume of 4000 gallons of water.

The initial volume of water in the river is given as 4000 gallons.\n2. On the second day, the volume doubles, which means the volume becomes 4000 * 2.\n3. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added. So we add 6000 to the volume of the second day to get the total volume of water on the third day.\n\nNow, let's compute it using Python.\n\n```python\n#initial volume of water\ninitial_volume = 4000  # in gallons\n\n#volume on the second day - it becomes twice\nsecond_day_volume = 2 * initial_volume\n\n#volume on the third day - additional 6000 gallons are added\nthird_day_volume = second_day_volume + 6000\n\nprint(third_day_volume)\n```"
