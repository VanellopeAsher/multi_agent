You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Then, we assume Joey also scores some points, say X. We know that Joey is winning, so his points after his turn (214 + X) should be greater than Marcy's new total points. We then find the difference between Joey's points and Marcy's points which gives the points by which Joey is winning.\n\nLet's code this up:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Marcy's new total points\nmarcy_points = 225 + 10\n\n# Joey's points before his turn\njoey_points_before = 214\n\n# declare a symbol for Joey's points scored in his turn\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Joey's points after his turn should be greater than Marcy's points\n# which gives 214 + x > marcy_points\n# We solve this inequality for x\njoey_points_scored = solve(joey_points_before + x - marcy_points, x)[0]\n\n# Points by which Joey is winning is (Joey's points after his turn) - (Marcy's new total points)\nwinning_points = joey_points_before + joey_points_scored - marcy_points\n\nprint(\"Joey is winning by\", winning_points, \"points.\")\n```"

However, we can create an inequality to represent the amount Joey should score in order to win.\n\nGiven the conditions of the problem, we know that after scoring, Joey must have more points than Marcy. We can express this as:\n\nJoey's score (after scoring) > Marcy's score (after scoring)\n\nwhere,\nMarcy's score (after scoring) = 225 points (before scoring) + 10 points = 235 points\nand\nJoey's score (after scoring) = 214 points (before scoring) + X points (Joey's scoring this round)\n\nWe represent X as the minimum number of points Joey must score in his turn to win the game. So, the inequality becomes:\n\n214 points + X > 235 points\n\nSolving the inequality for X gives us:\n\nX > 235 points - 214 points\n\nCalculating the value for X:\n\n```python\n# Marcy's total points after scoring\nmarcy_points_after = 225 + 10\n\n# Joey's points before scoring\njoey_points_before = 214\n\n# The minimum number of points Joey needs to score to win\nX = marcy_points_after - joey_points_before\n\n# As Joey must score more than X points to win, we add 1 to X\nX = X + 1\n\nprint(\"To win, Joey needs to score more than\", X, \"points.\")\n```\n\nUnfortunately, without the information about how many points Joey scored in his turn, we can't calculate by how many points Joey is winning. We can only say that Joey needs to score more than X points to win the game."
