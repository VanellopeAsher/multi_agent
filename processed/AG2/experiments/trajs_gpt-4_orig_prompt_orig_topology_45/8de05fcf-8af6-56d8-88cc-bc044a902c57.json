A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.  Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.If she spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days, how many times as many articles did she write on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

We can use Python to solve it directly.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nLet's define:\nM: Number of articles written on Monday\nT: Number of articles written on Tuesday\nW: Number of articles written on Wednesday\n\nWe know from the problem:\n\n1) M is 5\n2) T is 2/5 more than M, therefore T = M + 2/5 * M = 7\n3) The total hours spent for these three days are 104, and it takes 4 hours to write one article. Therefore, M + T + W = 104 / 4 = 26\n4) Our target is to find how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday, or W/T.\n\nNow, we can solve it:\n\n- Step 1: Calculate W with equation M + T + W = 26\n- Step 2: Calculate W/T\n\nLet's write some Python code to achieve this."
