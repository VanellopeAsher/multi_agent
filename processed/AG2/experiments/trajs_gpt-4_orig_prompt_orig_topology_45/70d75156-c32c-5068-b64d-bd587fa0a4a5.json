You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMrs. Harrington bought several boxes of oranges at the market.

Each term of the expression corresponds to a step in the problem. \n\nThe \"15*n\" comes from factoring out the 20 oranges per box from the (n-4) boxes left after she gave to her mom and sister, and kept 1/4 for herself.\n\nThe \"-60\" corresponds to the 2 boxes of oranges each given to her mom and sister, totaling 4 boxes or 80 oranges, which is, when divided by 4 (since she kept 1/4 of the total), equals 60. \n\nThis expression is abstract and doesn't provide an exact number of boxes sold unless we have a value for 'n'. The expression shows the relationship between the initial number of boxes ('n') Mrs. Harrington bought and the number of oranges she sold.\n\nTo get the exact count, we need to know how many boxes Mrs. Harrington bought initially."
