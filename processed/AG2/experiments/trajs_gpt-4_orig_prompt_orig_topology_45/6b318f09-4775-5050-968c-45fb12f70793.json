You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

Compute the total number of people invited by multiplying the number of families by the number of people in each family.\n2.

Subtract the number of people who cannot attend from the total number of guests invited to find out the number of people who show up.\n\nLet's implement a Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of families and people in each family\nfamilies_6 = 12\npeople_per_family_6 = 6\n\nfamilies_4 = 15\npeople_per_family_4 = 4\n\n# Number of people that could not attend\nillness = 16\ncommitments = illness / 4\n\n# Total people invited\ntotal_invited = (families_6 * people_per_family_6) + (families_4 * people_per_family_4)\n\n# Total people that could not attend\ntotal_could_not_attend = illness + commitments\n\n# People that show up\nshow_up = total_invited - total_could_not_attend\n\nprint(show_up)\n```\nThe output will be the number of people who show up at Martha's party."
