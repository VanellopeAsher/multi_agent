She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

So, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1) ``T + C = total amount of packets``\n2) ``40T + 30C = total cost``\n\nWe know the total cost, or $3200, and the number of packets for celery, or 80. Now, we are trying to solve the equations for T, which represents the number of packets for tomatoes.\n\nLet's substitute the given values into our equations and solve the system with sympy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nT, C = symbols('T C')\n\n# number of seed packets\nnum_celery = 80\n\n# total cost (dollars)\ntotal_cost = 3200\n\n# equation 1: T + C = total packets\nequation1 = Eq(T + C, num_celery)\n\n# equation 2: 40T + 30C = total cost\nequation2 = Eq(40 * T + 30 * C, total_cost)\n\n# substituting the number of celery packets into equation 1\nequation1_subs = equation1.subs(C, num_celery)\n\n# solving for T\nnum_tomato = solve(equation1_subs, T)[0]\nprint(\"The number of tomato seed packets: \", num_tomato)\n```\n\nThe result will be the number of tomato seed packets."

      "content": "It seems there is an error in the initial equations setup. We know that there are only 80 celery packets, not that the total number of packets is 80. So, rather than setting up the equations as earlier stated, we can encode the cost of each packet type into the equation.\n\nLet's modify the equations as follows:\n\n1) ``T + 80 = total packets``\n2) ``40T + 30*80 = total cost``\n\nThe total cost is known, which is $3200. We replace these values into our equations and solve for `T`.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# total cost (dollars)\ntotal_cost = 3200\n\n# cost of seeds \ncost_celery = 30 * 80\n\n# equation: 40T + cost of celery seeds = total cost\nequation = Eq(40 * T + cost_celery, total_cost)\n\n# solving for T\nnum_tomato = solve(equation, T)[0]\nprint(\"The number of tomato seed packets: \", num_tomato)\n```\n\nThe result will be the number of tomato seed packets."
