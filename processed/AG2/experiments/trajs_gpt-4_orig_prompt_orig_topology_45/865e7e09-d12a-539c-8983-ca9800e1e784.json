You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo girls each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water.

We will subtract each individual's share of water from the total.\n\nHere are the key steps:\n1. Compute the shares of the two girls. Each got 1/4 of 32 liters, so together they got 2/4 (or 1/2) of 32 liters.\n2. Subtract this amount from the total.\n3. Subtract the boy's share from the remaining amount.\n\nLet's do this in Python using the sympy package.\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the total amount of water\ntotal_water = 32\n\n# calculate the amount of water the two girls got\ngirls_water = total_water / 4 * 2\n\n# calculate the amount of water left after the girls got their shares\nafter_girls = total_water - girls_water\n\n# define the amount of water the boy got\nboy_water = 8\n\n# calculate the amount of water left after the boy got his share\nremaining_water = after_girls - boy_water\n\n# print the result\nprint(f'The amount of water remaining is {remaining_water} liters.')\n```"
