However, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

This can be achieved by performing a series of arithmetic operations as the depth of water changes each day from Monday to Thursday.\n\nLet's solve this problem using Python:\n\n1. Start with Monday's depth (17 feet).\n2. Calculate Tuesday's depth (17 feet + 7 feet).\n3. Calculate Wednesday's depth (2/3 of Tuesday's depth).\n4. Calculate the difference between Tuesday's and Wednesday's depths.\n5. Calculate the increase on Thursday (1/2 of the difference).\n6. Calculate Thursday's depth (Wednesday's depth + increase).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# Define the depth on Monday\ndepth_monday = 17\n\n# Tuesday: The tank had 7 feet more water than it had on Monday\ndepth_tuesday = depth_monday + 7\n\n# Wednesday: The depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday\ndepth_wednesday = (2/3) * depth_tuesday\n\n# Thursday: The tank's water depth increased by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday\ndifference = depth_tuesday - depth_wednesday\nincrease_thursday = (1/2) * difference\n\n# Calculate the tank’s water depth on Thursday\ndepth_thursday = depth_wednesday + increase_thursday\n\nprint(depth_thursday)\n```"
