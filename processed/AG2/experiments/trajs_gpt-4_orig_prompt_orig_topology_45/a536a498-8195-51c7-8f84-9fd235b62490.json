You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number.

      "content": "The key idea here is to understand that Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, meaning she reported 20% more people than there actually were.\n\nWe can solve this problem with Python code directly. We can use the formula:\n\n```\nActual Number = Reported Number / (1 + % Overstated/100)\n```\n\nUsing this formula, we can find the actual number of people at the concert according to Courtney.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Courtney reported the audience to be 48\nreported_number = 48\n\n# percentage overstatement according to Kelly\npercentage_overstated = 20 # in percentage\n\n# Using the formula to find the actual number\nactual_number = sp.simplify(reported_number / (1 + (percentage_overstated / 100)))\n\nprint(actual_number)\n```\nThis code will give us the actual number of people who attended the concert according to Courtney's report (if Kelly was right about the overstatement)."
