In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

It's also stated that each girl brought back the amount of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times the boys' amount. We can express this mathematically and solve for the number of shells each girl brought.\n\n```python\n# define the number of shells brought by each boy\nshells_each_boy = 60\n\n# calculate the number of shells each girl brought\nshells_each_girl = shells_each_boy + 4.5 * shells_each_boy\n\n# print the result\nprint(shells_each_girl)\n```\n\nThe result will be the number of seashells brought by each girl."
