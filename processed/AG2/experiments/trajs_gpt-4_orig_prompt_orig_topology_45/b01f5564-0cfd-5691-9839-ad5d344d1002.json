You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein.

So we need to find out how much protein is there in 300 grams of mushrooms per day and multiply it by 7 to get the total protein intake per week.\n\nLet's do the calculations step by step.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Find the protein quantity in 300 grams of mushrooms\nweight_of_mushrooms_per_day = 300  # in grams\nweight_of_cup_of_mushrooms = 150  # in grams\nprotein_in_cup_of_mushrooms = 4  # in grams\n\n# Since the protein quantity is proportional to the weight, it can be calculated as \n# (protein in the mushroom cup / weight of the mushroom cup) * weight of mushrooms per day\nprotein_per_day = (protein_in_cup_of_mushrooms / weight_of_cup_of_mushrooms) * weight_of_mushrooms_per_day\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total protein intake per week\ndays_per_week = 7\nprotein_per_week = protein_per_day * days_per_week\n\nprint(\"The grams of protein John gets per week: \", protein_per_week)\n```"
