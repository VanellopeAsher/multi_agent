You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to determine the number of letters in the alphabet, the number of times the alphabet was fully written, and finding half of the alphabet. We then multiply these values by the times written to obtain the total count. At the end, we must remember that Elise re-writes everything she has already written, so we have to double the count.\n\nWe can solve this problem with Python code directly using these steps. Let's start the code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# There are 26 letters in the alphabet\nalphabet_count = 26\n\n# The alphabet was fully written 3 times\nfull_writes = 3\n\n# Half of the alphabet is written once\nhalf_writes = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of letters written initially\ninitial_writes = (full_writes * alphabet_count) + (half_writes * sp.Rational(alphabet_count, 2))\n\n# Elise re-writes all that she has already written\ntotal_writes = initial_writes * 2\n\nprint(total_writes)\n```"
