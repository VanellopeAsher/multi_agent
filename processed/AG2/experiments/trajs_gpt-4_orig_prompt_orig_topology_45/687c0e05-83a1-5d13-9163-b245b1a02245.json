You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands.

We know the number of female unicorns in Scotland, and from there we can find the total number of unicorns in Scotland. Knowing that this number represents 1/3 of all the unicorns in the world, we can then find the total number of unicorns.\n\nHere's how to do it in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# There are 6 female unicorns in Scotland\nfemale_unicorns = 6\n\n# If two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female, we can write an equation to solve the total number of unicorns in Scotland\nunicorns_in_scotland = symbols('unicorns_in_scotland')\neq1 = Eq(2/3 * unicorns_in_scotland, female_unicorns)\n\nscotland_total_unicorns = solve(eq1, unicorns_in_scotland)[0]\n\n# If a third of them are in the Scottish Highlands, we can find the total number of unicorns worldwide\nworld_total_unicorns = 3 * scotland_total_unicorns\n\nprint(world_total_unicorns)\n```\n\nLet's run these calculations. Please provide me with the result of 'world_total_unicorns'."
