You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\n48 people are riding a bus.

Since there are only a few steps, Python can calculate the result in one go.\n\nHowever, in order to improve the readability, I will break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many people get on the bus at the first stop. Multiply the number who got off (8) by 5, then subtract 2 because two of them decided to get off again.\n2. Subtract the number who got off at the first stop from the initial 48 passengers, and add the number who got on at the first stop.\n3. At the second stop, subtract the number who got off and add the number who got on. The number who got on is 3 times fewer than the number who got off (21), so we divide 21 by 3 to get the number who got on. \n\nThen our result will be the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop."
