  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

Then, divide this total weight by the maximum capacity of the truck in one trip, rounding up to the next whole number, since he can't make a fraction of a trip.\n\nFirst, let me calculate the total amount of feed. For each type of feed, I'm going to multiply the number of packages by the weight of each package:\n\n1. Sugar cubes: 20 boxes * 10 pounds/box = total sugar cubes weight\n2. Carrots: 40 bags * 120 pounds/bag = total carrots weight\n3. Hay: 420 bales * 750 pounds/bale = total hay weight\n4. Oats: 200 sacks * 650 pounds/sack = total oats weight\n\nThen add all the weights together to get the total amount of feed. \n\nNow, let me calculate these."
