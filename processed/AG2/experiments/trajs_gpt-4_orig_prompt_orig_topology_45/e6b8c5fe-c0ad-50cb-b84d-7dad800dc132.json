You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nColby wants to buy some gumballs.

If you are interested in a different price, please update me.\n\nIn this case, the total amount of money Colby has is the sum of the amounts from all these quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.\n\nHere is the python program to do this:\n\n```python\n#Define the amount each coin represents in cents\nquarter_value = 25 \ndime_value = 10\nnickel_value = 5\npenny_value = 1\n\n#Define the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies\nquarters = 8\ndimes = 6\nnickels = 14\npennies = 15\n\n#Use the coin amounts and their quantities to find the total number of cents\ntotal_cents = quarters * quarter_value + dimes * dime_value + nickels * nickel_value + pennies * penny_value\n\n#Define the price of a gumball\ngumball_price = 25\n\n#Calculate the number of gumballs\nnum_gumballs = total_cents // gumball_price\n\nprint(num_gumballs)\n```\nThis code will give the number of gumballs Colby could buy. If the price of a gumball is different than 25 cents, please adjust it in the code provided."
