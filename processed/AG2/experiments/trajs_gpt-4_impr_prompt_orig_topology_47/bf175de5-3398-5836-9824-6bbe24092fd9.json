Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "KEY IDEA: \nWhen multiple individuals work together on a task, their work capacities add up. \n\nLet's consider an individual's work capacity. If one individual can complete half of the house in 5 days, they can complete an entire house in 10 days. The rate of working for an individual is therefore 1 house/10 days = 0.1 houses/day.\n\nIn the context of a team of 5 individuals, their combined work capacity would be 5 times the work capacity of one individual. Hence, their combined rate is 5 * 0.1 houses/day = 0.5 houses/day.\n\nNow, if we want to find how long will it take for the team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house, we can apply the formula: time = work/rate.\n\nLet's now utilize Python to calculate the required time and convert it to hours.\n\nPython steps to implement:\n1. Calculate the work rate of one individual - 1 house in 10 days (since on individual can paint half of a house in 5 days).\n2. Calculate work rate of 5 individuals - 5 times the work rate of one individual.\n3. At a rate of 0.5 houses per day, calculate the time needed to paint an entire house.\n4. Convert the time to hours by multiplying by the number of hours in a day (24 hours).\n\nTime to implement this in Python."

Hence the work rate is indeed 1/10 = 0.1 houses/day.\n\n2. Work rate of a team of 5 individuals:\n   As each individual can paint 0.1 houses/day, 5 individuals can paint 5*0.1 = 0.5 houses/day.\n\n3. Time required to paint one house by the team:\n   Here the work is 1 house and the rate is 0.5 houses/day. So, the time required is 1/0.5 = 2 days.\n\n4. Converting time to hours:\n   1 day = 24 hours, hence,\n   2 days = 2*24 = 48 hours.\n\nThus, all steps of the calculation have been verified and no errors were found.\n\nSo, our final answer is \\boxed{48}."
