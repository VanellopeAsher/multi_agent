Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $3000/month, her credit card's minimum is $2000/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $5000/month.

      "content": "Key Concept:\nThe question involves a simple arithmetic problem of adding up all Jessica's monthly debts, calculating 50% more than the minimum for each debt, and finally computing the total annual payment.\n\nPython Solution:\nWe can solve this problem by adding up all Jessica's monthly payments, calculating 50% more than the minimum, multiplying that by 12 to get an annual figure, and printing the result.\n\nLet's write the Python code:\n```python\n# Define the minimum payments\nstudent_loan_payment = 3000\ncc_payment = 2000\nmortgage_payment = 5000\n\n# The increase Jessica wants to pay\nincrease_rate = 50/100\n\n# Calculate Jessica's total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + cc_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate 50% more than the minimum\ntotal_monthly_payment += total_monthly_payment * increase_rate\n\n# Calculate annual payment\nannual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\nprint(annual_payment)\n```\nNow, you can go ahead and run the above python code in your local system and provide me with the output."

      "content": "Excellent. The python code executed successfully, and the result is valid.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nLet's break down each step of the computation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. Jessica's total monthly minimum obligations sum to $10,000 ($3000 for student loans + $2000 for credit cards + $5000 for mortgage).\n2. She intends to pay 50% more than the minimum, which delivers a value of $5,000 (50% of $10,000).\n3. Therefore, the total monthly cost is $15,000 ($10,000 minimum + $5,000 additional).\n4. Across a year, this amounts to $180,000 ($15,000 per month * 12 months), which matches the output of the Python program.\n\nFinal Answer:  Jessica will have to pay an annual total of \\$180,000 if she plans to contribute 50% more than the minimum to her debts. Hence, the answer is $boxed{180000}."
