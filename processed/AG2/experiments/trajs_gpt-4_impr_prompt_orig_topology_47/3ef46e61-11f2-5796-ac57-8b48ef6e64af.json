Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. However, on Fridays, he spends an additional 2 hours at work due to high call volumes. How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday?"

      "content": "Approach: \nHere, we can directly solve this problem using Python. We can calculate how many calls Tim can answer in a day and then add the additional calls he can answer on Friday. Multiplication and addition can be used to find the solution. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of calls that Tim can answer in a day. We know that he works 6 hours per day and each call takes him 15 minutes. To make the time units compatible, we can convert hours to minutes.\n\nIn Python:\n```python\nwork_hours_per_day = 6\nminutes_per_hour = 60\ncall_duration = 15\n\ncalls_per_day = (work_hours_per_day * minutes_per_hour) / call_duration\n```\n\nNext, we consider the additional hours Tim works on Fridays. This will add an extra 2 hours of call answering. Again, we convert the hours to minutes and determine how many more calls Tim can answer.\n\nIn Python:\n```python\nextra_work_hours_on_friday = 2\n\nextra_calls_on_friday = (extra_work_hours_on_friday * minutes_per_hour) / call_duration\n```\n\nFinally, we calculate the total calls Tim can answer in a week. He works for 5 days and deals with extra calls only on Friday.\n\nIn Python:\n```python\nwork_days_per_week = 5\n\ntotal_calls_per_week = (calls_per_day * work_days_per_week) + extra_calls_on_friday\n```\n\nThe total calls per week will be our final solution."

Thus, the number of calls he answers from Monday through Thursday equals 24 calls/day * 4 days = 96 calls. On Friday, he answers 24 calls during his regular hours and an additional 8 calls in the extra hours, making a total of 32 calls on Friday.\n\nSo, the total number of calls Tim answers in the week is 96 calls (Mon-Thurs) + 32 calls (Fri) = 128 calls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{128}."
