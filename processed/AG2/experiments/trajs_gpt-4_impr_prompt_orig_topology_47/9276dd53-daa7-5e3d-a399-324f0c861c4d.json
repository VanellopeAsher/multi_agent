Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 2000 helmets, calculate the total number of items Dominick saw."

The number of helmets is half the number of footballs.\n\nWe also know that there are 2000 helmets.\n\nGiven this information, we can directly calculate the total number of robots and helmets.\n\nPython Solution:\n\n```python\n# number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# number of robots is half the number of helmets\nrobots = helmets / 2\n\n# number of helmets is half the number of footballs\nfootballs = helmets * 2\n\n# Total objects observed\ntotal_objects = robots + helmets + footballs\n```\n\nAfter you print this value, we can move to the verification stage."

      "content": "Excellent, let's verify this.\n\nVerification:\n1. The number of robots is given as half the number of helmets. So, 2000/2 = 1000 robots.\n2. The number of helmets is given as half the number of footballs. So, 2000*2 = 4000 footballs.\n3. Adding them all up, total objects = robots + helmets + footballs = 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000.\n\nAs we can see, the Python operations have been verified successfully and the result is same as we expected. Thus, we have confirmed that the solution is correct.\n\nYour final answer is 7000.0. Please note that the decimal is due to Python's automatic conversion of integer division results to floating-point numbers.  Feel free to round it to 7000 if necessary.\n\nSo, the total number of items Dominick saw is,\n\\[7000\\]."
