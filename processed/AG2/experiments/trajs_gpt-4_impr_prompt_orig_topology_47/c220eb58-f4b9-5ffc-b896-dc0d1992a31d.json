Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?"

Add this result to the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson for the total number of messages delivered.\n\nNow, let's write a Python solution for this problem. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_to_Thompson = 84\n\n# number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu\nmessages_to_Yu = sp.Rational(messages_to_Thompson, 3)\n\n# total number of messages delivered\ntotal_messages = messages_to_Thompson + messages_to_Yu\nprint(total_messages)\n```"

The total number of messages delivered by James to both teachers is 112.\n\nHere's a step-by-step verification:\n- Number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson: 84\n- Number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu (1/3 of messages to Ms. Thompson): 84 รท 3 = 28\n- Total number of messages delivered: 84 (Ms. Thompson) + 28 (Mr. Yu) = 112 \n\nSo the final answer is indeed \\boxed{112}."
