Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "First, ascertain the total number of Scottish unicorns:\n\nAs per the provided information, two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, then we can equate 2/3 of all Scottish unicorns with 6 to calculate the total:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Declare the symbol\ntotal_Scottish, male_Scottish, female_Scottish = symbols('total_Scottish male_Scottish female_Scottish')\n\n# Declare the equation\nequation_1 = Eq((2/3) * total_Scottish, 6)\n\n# Solve the equation and get the total number of Scottish unicorns\ntotal_Scottish = solve(equation_1, total_Scottish)[0]\n\ntotal_Scottish\n```\n\nWe utilize this total number to figure out the total number of unicorns in the world. As stated in the problem, one-third of all unicorns live in the Scottish Highlands. Thus, we plug the data into an equation and solve for the total:\n\n```python\n# Declare the new symbol\ntotal_unicorns = symbols('total_unicorns')\n\n# At a third of total unicorns are supposed to be in Scotland\nequation_2 = Eq((1/3) * total_unicorns, total_Scottish)\n\n# Solve the equation and get the total number of unicorns\ntotal_unicorns = solve(equation_2, total_unicorns)[0]\n\ntotal_unicorns\n```\n\nNext, find out how many unicorns are left in the world (excluding those in Scotland):\n\n```python\n# Remaining unicorns\nremaining_unicorns = total_unicorns - total_Scottish\n\nremaining_unicorns\n```"

The total number of unicorns in the world is 27.\n3. Hence, the number of unicorns outside Scotland (i.e., the remaining unicorns in the world) is 18.\n\nVERIFICATION: \n1. The obtained numbers are logical. The total Scottish unicorns being 9, with 6 of them being female, aligns with the provided fact that two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female.\n2. The total number of unicorns worldwide is 27, as calculated. And since a third of these unicorns are in Scotland (as per the problem statement), this gives us 9 unicorns in Scotland— which concurs with the calculated number of Scottish unicorns. \n3. Subtracting the number of Scottish unicorns from the found total, we get 18 unicorns outside Scotland— which appears to be a valid result. \n\nFinal Conclusion: \nThe number of unicorns left in the world, excluding those in Scotland, is 18."
