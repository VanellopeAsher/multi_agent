Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

Then, we'll sum them up to get the total age of all the siblings.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the age of the sisters:\nThe age of each sister is 1.6 times of ten, so the total age of the three sisters is 3 times that.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the age of the younger brother:\nThe younger brother is 3/5 of 20 years old.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the age of the older brother:\nThe older brother's age is twice that of his younger brother.\n\nFinally, we'll add these three values together to get the total age. Let's write a Python program to do these steps."

Since there are three sisters, their total age is 16*3 = 48 years.\n\n2. The age of the younger brother: The younger brother is 3/5 of 20 years old, which is 12 years.\n\n3. The age of the older brother: The older brother is twice as old as the younger brother, so his age is 2*12 = 24 years.\n\nAdding up these results:\n- Total age = age_sisters + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age = 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years\n\nThe Python code has returned an output of 84.0. This matches our manual calculations, so we can say the Python code has executed correctly.\n\nThe total age of all siblings is \\boxed{84} years."
