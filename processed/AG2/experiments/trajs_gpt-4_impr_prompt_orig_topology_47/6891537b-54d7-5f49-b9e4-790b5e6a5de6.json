Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "Perfect! This means that Miss Maria has \\boxed{30} students. \n\nNext, let's verify the solution.\n\nVerification:\n\n1) The total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has = number of cards in each deck * number of decks = 25 cards/deck * 6 decks = 150 cards.\n\n2) The total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has = number of cards in each box * number of boxes = 40 cards/box * 5 boxes = 200 cards.\n\n3) Therefore, the total number of cards Miss Maria has = total basketball cards + total baseball cards = 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards.\n\n4) The number of cards Miss Maria keeps for herself = 50 cards. So, the cards left after she keeps some for herself = total cards - cards kept by Miss Maria = 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards.\n\n5) Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has = cards left / cards per student = 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students.\n\nAs per the verification steps, Miss Maria has \\boxed{30} students, which matches our initial found value. Hence, our solution is correct."
