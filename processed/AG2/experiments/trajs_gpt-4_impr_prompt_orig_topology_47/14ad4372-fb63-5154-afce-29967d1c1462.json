Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday.

      "content": "Okay, let's verify the calculation.\n\nVerification Steps:\n1. First of all, Judy teaches 5 classes every day from Monday to Friday, which equals to 5 classes/day × 5 days = 25 classes.\n2. Then, she teaches 8 more classes on Saturday. So, the total number of classes she teaches in a week becomes 25 + 8 = 33 classes. This calculation matches with our program.\n3. Judy charges each student $15 per class and since there are 15 students in each class, she earns 15 students/class × $15/student = $225 per class. This is in accordance with our previous calculation.\n4. Finally, if we multiply her earnings per class by the total number of classes she teaches in a week, we get Judy's total weekly earnings. This equals to $225/class × 33 classes = $7425. This result is in agreement with the output of the Python code.\n\nTherefore, the Python code has correctly calculated Judy's total weekly earnings based on the problem's requirements. As a result, we return our final answer.\n\nSo, the total money Judy makes in 1 week is \\$\\boxed{7425}."
