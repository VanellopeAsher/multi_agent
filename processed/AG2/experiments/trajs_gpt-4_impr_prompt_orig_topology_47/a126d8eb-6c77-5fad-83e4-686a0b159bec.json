Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJake is shopping at a clothing store. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Jake decides to buy 20 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $80. Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $400. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?"

      "content": "This problem can be directly solved with Python by computing the money spent on the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then adding them together.\n\nThe T-shirts:\nJake is buying 20 T-shirts. With the buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake buys one T-shirt at the full price while the second one is half price. Therefore, the price of two T-shirts is $80 + $80*0.5 = $120. \nSo, the cost for 20 shirts will be $120*10 = $1200\n\nThe shoes:\nThe shoes are 40% off. Meaning, Jake only pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost of the shoes after discount is $400*0.6 = $240\n\nAdding the costs on T-shirts and shoes, we get the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.\n\nBy putting it into code:\n\n```python\n# Cost of t-shirts\nnum_tshirts = 20\noriginal_price_tshirt = 80\ndiscounted_price_tshirt = original_price_tshirt + 0.5 * original_price_tshirt\ntotal_cost_tshirts = (num_tshirts / 2) * discounted_price_tshirt\n\n# Cost of shoes\noriginal_price_shoes = 400\ndiscount_percent_shoes = 0.4\ndiscounted_price_shoes = original_price_shoes * (1 - discount_percent_shoes)\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = total_cost_tshirts + discounted_price_shoes\n```\n\nAfter this, you can print the result using the print function."

      "content": "Verification:\n\nLet's verify our found value:\n\nThe cost for t-shirts was calculated as follows:\n\n- The price for 2 t-shirts (due to the buy 1, get 1 50% off) deal is $80 (full price for 1st t-shirt) + $40 (50% of the 2nd t-shirt) = $120.\n- Then, to find the cost for 20 shirts, we multiplied $120 by 10 (since 20 / 2 = 10). Therefore, the total cost for the t-shirts is $120 * 10 = $1200.\n\nThe cost for shoes was calculated as follows:\n\n- Since the shoes were 40% off, we subtracted 40% from the full price: $400 * (1 - 40/100) = $240.\n\nAdding these costs together, we got the total amount spent: $1200 (for t-shirts) + $240 (for shoes) = $1440.\n\nSo, the verification confirms that the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $\\boxed{1440} (in dollars)."
