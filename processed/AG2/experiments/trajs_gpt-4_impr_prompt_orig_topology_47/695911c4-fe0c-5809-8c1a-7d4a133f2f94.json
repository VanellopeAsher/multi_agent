Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $10. After 10 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

      "content": "Approach:\nWe can solve the problem through straightforward calculations. \n\nFirstly, we need to find out how much Pauline spent on the museum visits in the first 10 years. Given that she visits three times a year and the cost of one visit is $10, we can multiply these together and then multiply the result by 10 years. \n\nSecondly, we need to calculate the cost of a visit after it increased by 150%. We then multiply this by the number of visits per year and the number of years in the second period.\n\nFinally, adding these two amounts together will give us the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum. Let's implement this in Python. \n```python\n#Python solution\n#Given data and calculations\nvisit_cost_initial = 10  # initial cost in dollars\nvisits_per_year = 3  # number of visits per year\nfirst_period_years = 10  # years for the first period\ncost_increase_percentage = 150  # cost increase percentage\n\n# Total cost for the first period\nfirst_period_cost = visit_cost_initial * visits_per_year * first_period_years\n\n# New cost of visit\nvisit_cost_new = visit_cost_initial + (visit_cost_initial * (cost_increase_percentage / 100))\n\nsecond_period_years = 3  # years for the second period\n\n# Total cost for the second period\nsecond_period_cost = visit_cost_new * visits_per_year * second_period_years\n\n# Total amount Pauline spent\ntotal_cost = first_period_cost + second_period_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\nWe'll run this program to get the total amount Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum."

So, in the first 10 years, she spent $10 * 3 * 10 = $300. \n4. After 10 years, the cost of a visit increased by 150%, which makes it $10 + $15 = $25.\n5. In the next 3 years, she spent $25 * 3 * 3 = $225, visiting the museum at the new price.\n6. So, the total amount she spent over the period is $300 + $225 = $525.\n\nHence, the verification is complete, and the total cost executed by Pauline on her visits to the museum is \\boxed{525} dollars."
