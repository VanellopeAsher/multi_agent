Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

Calculate the cost of one packet of chicken which is twice as much as a pack of bacon.\n3. Calculate the total price of the chicken.\n4. Calculate the total price of strawberries.\n5. Find out the price for a pack of apple.\n6. Calculate the total price of apples.\n7. Calculate the total price of all items.\n8. Calculate how much Kelly has left in her budget.\n9.

      "content": "Alright, let's tackle this Python style.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the cost of a single pack of bacon. We know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 so we can calculate the price of a single pack by dividing the total cost by the number of packs.\n\n```python\ntotal_bacon_cost = 10.5\nnum_bacon_packs = 5\nprice_per_bacon = total_bacon_cost / num_bacon_packs\n```\n\nNext, we can calculate the cost of a packet of chicken - it's twice as expensive as a pack of bacon. Then, since we have 6 packets of chicken, we can also calculate the total chicken cost.\n\n```python\nprice_per_chicken = price_per_bacon * 2\nnum_chicken_packs = 6\ntotal_chicken_cost = price_per_chicken * num_chicken_packs\n```\n\nWe know that there are 3 packs of strawberries costing $4.5 each, giving a total cost. Similarly, we can calculate the price of each apple pack which costs half as much as a pack of strawberries, and then find out the total cost of apples as well.\n\n```python\nprice_per_strawberry = 4.5\nnum_strawberry_packs = 3\ntotal_strawberry_cost = price_per_strawberry * num_strawberry_packs\n\nprice_per_apple = price_per_strawberry / 2\nnum_apple_packs = 7\ntotal_apple_cost = price_per_apple * num_apple_packs\n```\n\nNow we can calculate the total spendings and how much money does Kelly have left in her budget.\n\n```python\ntotal_spent = total_bacon_cost + total_chicken_cost + total_strawberry_cost + total_apple_cost\ntotal_budget = 65\nremainder = total_budget - total_spent\n```\nFinally, the remainder is the money left in Kelly's budget.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the remainder."
