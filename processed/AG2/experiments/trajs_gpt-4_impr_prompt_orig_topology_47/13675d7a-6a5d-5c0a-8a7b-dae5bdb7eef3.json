Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Henry knows that to assemble all the toys he will need 4 wheels for each car and 2 wheels for each motorcycle. There are 276 wheels left in a box after Henry assembles all toys.

The total number of wheels that were initially in the box can be found by adding the number of wheels used by Henry to the number of wheels left after he finished assembling the toys.\n\nLet's proceed to compute it using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of wheels per toy\nwheels_per_car = 4\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\n\n# number of toys\ncars = 57\nmotorcycles = 73\n\n# wheels left\nwheels_left = 276\n\n# calculate total wheels used\nwheels_used = (cars * wheels_per_car) + (motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle)\n\n# calculate total wheels in box\ntotal_wheels = wheels_left + wheels_used\n\nprint(total_wheels)\n```"

      "content": "Verification Steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of wheels used by Henry to assemble the cars. This is obtained by multiplying the number of cars (57) by the number of wheels per car (4). Therefore, Henry used 228 wheels for the cars.\n2. Calculate the total number of wheels used by Henry to assemble the motorcycles. This is obtained by multiplying the number of motorcycles (73) by the number of wheels per motorcycle (2). Therefore, Henry used 146 wheels for the motorcycles.\n3. The total wheels used by Henry is the sum of the wheels used for the cars and the motorcycles, which is 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.\n4. Lastly, the total number of wheels that were initially in the box is the sum of the wheels left (276) and the wheels used (374), which is 276 + 374 = 650 wheels.\n5. The Python code correctly calculated the total number of wheels that were initially in the box.\n\nSo, the total number of wheels in the box is \\boxed{650}."
