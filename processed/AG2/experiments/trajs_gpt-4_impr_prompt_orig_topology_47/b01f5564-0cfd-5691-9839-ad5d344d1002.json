Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

      "content": "Key Idea or Concept: Proportionality.\n\nSince the grams of protein in mushrooms is directly proportional to the total weight of mushrooms, we can set up an equation to determine the protein intake. We just need to scale up the protein content corresponding to the total weight of mushrooms consumed.\n\nWe can then multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake.\n\nPython Solution Approach:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms.\nStep 2: Multiply the result by 7 to get the weekly protein intake.\n\nLet's implement this in Python."

This means that every gram of mushrooms contains 4/150 grams of protein and John consumes 300g of mushrooms per day.\n\nLet's compute below for daily and then weekly protein intake.\n\n```python\n# Initial conditions\nprotein_per_cup = 4\nweight_per_cup = 150\ndaily_intake = 300\n\n# Daily protein intake\ndaily_protein = (protein_per_cup / weight_per_cup) * daily_intake\n\n# Weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein = daily_protein * 7\n\nprint(weekly_protein)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `print(weekly_protein)` with `weekly_protein` to get the final result."
