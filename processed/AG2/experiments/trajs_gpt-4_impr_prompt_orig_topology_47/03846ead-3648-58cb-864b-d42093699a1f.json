Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStudents in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a field trip. In the class, there are Alex, Mary, Bella, and Tim. Alex has collected 60 points. Bella outperformed Alex and collected 30% more. Mary managed to collect 3 times more points than Tim, who has 40 points less than Bella. How many points is the class missing to go on the field trip if the minimum threshold is 500 points?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved using a step-by-step process. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. Calculate the number of points Bella has collected. Bella collected 30% more points than Alex, so we multiply Alex's 60 points by 1.3.\n2. Calculate the number of points Tim has collected. Tim has 40 points less than Bella, so we subtract 40 from Bella's point total.\n3. Calculate the number of points Mary has collected. Mary collected 3 times more points than Tim, so we multiply Tim's points by 3.\n4. Sum the points collected by all four students.\n5. Subtract this sum from 500 to find out how many points are still needed for the field trip.\n\nNow let's implement the code according to this process."

Steps 1 and 2 correctly derived the points for Bella and Tim using Alex's points as reference.\n3. Step 3 correctly used Tim's points to obtain Mary's.\n4. Total points were summed correctly in Step 4, and step 5 found the difference correctly as well.\n5.
