Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved by following these steps:\n1. Find the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows.\n2. These three activities accounted for 30% of his total time spent, so we can divide the total time spent on these 3 activities by 0.3 to obtain the whole time.\n3. Subtract the combined time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows from the total time to find the time he spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's solve it step by step:\n1. Total time on boating and swimming = 6 hrs (boating) + 6/2 hrs (swimming) = 9 hrs\n2. Total time on shows = 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hrs\n3. The total time spent on boating, swimming and watching shows = 9 + 6 = 15 hrs\n\nLet's calculate the total time spent and the time spent sightseeing."

According to the problem, these activities took 30% of his total time. Dividing 15 hours by 30% or 0.3, we get a total time of 50 hours.\n3. Subtracting the time spent on boating, swimming and watching shows (15 hours) from the total time (50 hours), we get 35 hours, which should be the time spent sightseeing.\n\nTherefore, the time John spent sightseeing is \\boxed{35} hours."
