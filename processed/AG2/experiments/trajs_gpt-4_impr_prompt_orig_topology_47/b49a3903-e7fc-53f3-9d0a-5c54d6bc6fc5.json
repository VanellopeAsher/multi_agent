Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips and decides to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips. If he can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row and he buys 30 yellow tulips, how many total rows of flowers will he plant?"

      "content": "We can use Python to solve this problem directly.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of rows of each color of tulips Jackson will create based on how many tulips he has of each color and how many fit within a row. \n\nTo do this, we divide the number of tulips of each color by the number of tulips that fit in a row and round up to the nearest whole number, because even if there is a row that is not completely filled, it still counts as a row. The formula to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips is:\n\n```number_of_rows = ceil(number_of_tulips / tulips_per_row)```\n\nWhere:\n- number_of_tulips: The total number of tulips of a particular color that Jackson has.\n- tulips_per_row: The number of tulips of that color that can fit in a row.\n\nWe will use these calculated values to answer the final question: how many total rows of flowers will he plant.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\n\n```python\nfrom math import ceil\n\ndef calculate_rows(red_tulips, blue_tulips, yellow_tulips, red_per_row, blue_per_row, yellow_per_row):\n    # Calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips\n    red_rows = ceil(red_tulips / red_per_row)\n    blue_rows = ceil(blue_tulips / blue_per_row)\n    yellow_rows = ceil(yellow_tulips / yellow_per_row)\n\n    # Multiply the yellow rows by 2 since there is a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips\n    yellow_rows *= 2\n\n    # Calculate the total number of rows of flowers\n    total_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\n    print(total_rows)\n\ncalculate_rows(red_tulips=36, blue_tulips=24, \n               yellow_tulips=30, red_per_row=6, \n               blue_per_row=8, yellow_per_row=5)\n```\n\nThe output will be the total number of rows Jackson will plant in his garden."

      "content": "First, let's determine the number of rows of each color of tulips.\n\nThe number of rows of each type of tulip can be determined by dividing the total number of each type of tulip by the maximum number that can be placed in a row. By doing this, we can calculate how many rows Jackson can create with each type of tulip according to these formulas:\n\n```\nnumber_of_red_rows = total_red_tulips / red_tulips_per_row\n\nnumber_of_blue_rows = total_blue_tulips / blue_tulips_per_row\n\nnumber_of_yellow_rows = total_yellow_tulips / yellow_tulips_per_row\n```\n\nWe can calculate these values accordingly:\n\n```\nnumber_of_red_rows = 36 / 6 = 6 rows\nnumber_of_blue_rows = 24 / 8 = 3 rows\nnumber_of_yellow_rows = 30 / 5 = 6 rows\n```\n\nNow, let's add up these results. The total number of rows will be the sum:\n\n```\ntotal_rows = number_of_red_rows + number_of_blue_rows + number_of_yellow_rows\n```\n\nLet's perform the final calculation. The final answer will be the number of total rows that Jackson planted in his garden, and this value should be placed in \\boxed{}."

Nevertheless, I appreciate your patience as we continue to navigate through this problem.\n\nLet's go back to the prompt and organize the given data:\n\n- There are 36 red tulips that can be placed in 6 rows because Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in each row.\n- There are 24 blue tulips that can be placed in 3 rows because Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.\n- There are 30 yellow tulips that can be placed in 6 rows because Jackson can fit 5 yellow tulips in each row.\n- Note that yellow tulips need to be placed between every row of red and blue tulips, thus they would divide red and blue into 7 and 4 sections respectively.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can derive the equation to calculate the total rows of flowers which Jackson will plant:\n\ntotal_rows = number_of_red_rows + number_of_blue_rows + number_of_yellow_rows\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\ntotal_rows = 6 + 3 + (7 - 1) + (4 - 1)\n\nThe final solution can be obtained by summing these values.
