Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?"

Determine the total income from the gingerbread.\n2. Determine the total income from the apple pie.\n3. Sum up the total of these two incomes.\n\nLet's start with the first step.\n\nSaturday:\n- Gingerbread boxes: 10\n- Apple pie boxes: we don't know yet, but it's 4 less than the number of boxes sold on Sunday.\n\nSunday:\n- Gingerbread boxes: 10 + 5 = 15 (since on Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday)\n- Apple pie boxes: 15\n\nSo, on Saturday, Sunny sold: 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.\n\nMonday:\n- Gingerbread boxes: 2\n- Apple pie boxes: 4\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total earnings from selling gingerbread. \n\n```python\ngingerbread_units = 10 + 15 + 2   #total gingerbread boxes sold\ngingerbread_price = 6   #price per unit\ngingerbread_earnings = gingerbread_units * gingerbread_price\n```\n\nNext, we will find out the total earnings from selling apple pie.\n\n```python\napple_pie_units = 11 + 15 + 4   #total apple pie boxes sold\napple_pie_price = 15   #price per unit\napple_pie_earnings = apple_pie_units * apple_pie_price\n```\n\nIn the last step, we'll sum up these two results to get Sunny's total earnings.\n\n```python\ntotal_earnings = gingerbread_earnings + apple_pie_earnings\nprint(total_earnings)\n```"

Total gingerbread boxes sold: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) + 2 (Monday) = 27 boxes\n   Total earnings from gingerbread: 27 boxes * $6/box = $162\n2. Total apple pie boxes sold: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) + 4 (Monday) = 30 boxes\n   Total earnings from apple pie: 30 boxes * $15/box = $450\n3. Total earnings = $162 (from gingerbread) + $450 (from apple pie) = $612\n\nThe Python computation returned $612, which matches our manual computation. So, I'm confident the answer is correct.\n\nHence, Sunny earned a total of $612 from selling gingerbread and apple pie over three days.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{612}."
