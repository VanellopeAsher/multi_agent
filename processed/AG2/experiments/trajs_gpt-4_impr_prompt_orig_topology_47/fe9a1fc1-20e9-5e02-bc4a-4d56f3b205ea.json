Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKatarina has 5 less cookies than Max has. Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster, and Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. If Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies, how many cookies do they have in total?"

K = M - 5 (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)\n2. M = 1.2 * (C + 10) (Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster)\n3. S = M + 23 (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)\n4. K = 6.8 * 10 (Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies)\n\nWe can use sympy package to solve these equations for K, M, C and S. Then we'll sum up K, M, C and S to find the total number of cookies."

Now let's continue and solve the equations to find the number of cookies that each character has.\n\nFirstly, since from the fourth equation we know that K = 68 (6.8 * 10), we can substitute K into the first equation to find M. Then, we can substitute M into the second equation to find C. Once we found M and C, we can substitute M into the third equation to find S. After that, we add up all the amounts to get the total.\n\nLet's compute this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\nK, M, C, S = symbols('K M C S')  # Declare the symbols\n\n# Equation 1 - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max\neq1 = solve(M - K - 5, M)\n# Substitute the value of K from equation 4 into eq1 to find M\nM_value = eq1[0].subs(K, 68)\n\n# Equation 2 - Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster\neq2 = solve(1.2 * (C + 10) - M_value, C)\nC_value = eq2[0]\n\n# Equation 3 - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max\nS_value = M_value + 23\n\n# Calculate the total number of cookies\ntotal = K_value + M_value + C_value + S_value\nprint(total)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the result."
