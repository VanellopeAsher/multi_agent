Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nColby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 80 quarters, 60 dimes, 140 nickels, and 150 pennies, how many can he buy?"

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to first convert all the coins to the same denomination as the cost of the gumball (i.e., nickels). This will allow us to determine the total number of nickels Colby has, and subsequently, the number of gumballs he can buy. \n\nLet's translate this approach into Python, using sympy for calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the number of each type of coin\nquarters = 80\ndimes = 60\nnickels = 140\npennies = 150\n\n# Define the value of each type of coin in terms of nickels\nquarter_value = 5  # A quarter is worth 5 nickels\ndime_value = 2     # A dime is worth 2 nickels\npenny_value = Rational(1, 5)  # A penny is worth 1/5 of a nickel\n\n# Calculate the total value of each type of coin in terms of nickels\ntotal_quarters = quarters * quarter_value\ntotal_dimes = dimes * dime_value\ntotal_pennies = pennies * penny_value\n\n# Total up all the nickels\ntotal_nickels = total_quarters + total_dimes + nickels + total_pennies\n\n# Calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy\ngumballs = total_nickels\n\n# Print the result\nprint(gumballs)\n```\n\nRemember to follow the Python coding conventions (PEP8) when writing your script."
