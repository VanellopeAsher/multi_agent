Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn goes shopping and buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items, and he also decides to buy a pack of cookies for 2 dollars and a bottle of water for 1 dollar, how much did everything cost? Remember, the tax does not apply to food items."

      "content": "We can use Python to solve this problem directly. Since John is buying a mix of food and non-food items, we need to create two lists containing the prices of these items respectively. Food items include milk, eggs, cookies, and a bottle of water while non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.\n\nAfter having these lists, sum up the prices and then calculate the tax for non-food items. Adding the sum of food items, sum of non-food items, and the tax gives the total cost.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n```python\n# list of food items and their prices\nfood_items = [2, 3, 2, 1] # milk, eggs, cookies, water\n# list on non-food items and their prices\nnon_food_items = [3, 3, 4] # light bulbs, cups, roach traps \n\n# Calculate the tax\ntax_percentage = 10 / 100 # tax is 10%\ntax = sum(non_food_items) * tax_percentage \n\n# total cost is the sum of food items, non-food items and the tax\ntotal_cost = sum(food_items) + sum(non_food_items) + tax \n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nRemember to put the final result in the box."
