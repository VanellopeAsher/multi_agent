      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many total sports cards Miss Maria has. This is the sum of the cards in 6 decks, 5 boxes, and her special collection. Then, subtract the 50 cards she keeps for herself. Finally, divide the remaining cards by the number of cards each student receives to get the total number of students.\n\nHere's the Python solution for it:\n\n```python\n# total cards in the decks\ntotal_deck_cards = 6 * 25\n\n# total cards in the boxes\ntotal_box_cards = 5 * 40\n\n# total cards in her special collection\ntotal_special_collection = 30\n\n# total cards Maria has\ntotal_cards = total_deck_cards + total_box_cards + total_special_collection\n\n# cards left after Maria keeps some for herself\ncards_left = total_cards - 50\n\n# number of students\nnum_students = cards_left // 10\n\nprint(num_students)\n```\nNote: The \"//\" operator is used for floor division, as you can't have a fractional student. It gives the quotient of the division and discards the remainder."

Total cards in the boxes: \n   5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards\n\n3. Total cards in Maria's special collection: \n   1 collection * 30 cards/collection = 30 cards\n\nThe total cards that Miss Maria has in total are: \n150 (from decks) + 200 (from boxes) + 30 (from special collection) = 380 cards\n\nMiss Maria keeps 50 cards, leaving 380 - 50 = 330 cards to be distributed among the students.\n\nIf each student gets 10 cards, the total number of students are:\n330 cards / 10 cards/student = 33 students\n\nThe final answer is thus 33 students which matches the given Python output.\n\nHence, Miss Maria has \\boxed{33} students."
