Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack. On the initial day, the medical staff utilized 38 bandages and procured one large pack of bandages. The following day, they used ten bandages less than the previous day. On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages and only expended half a pack. They had 78 bandages remaining at the conclusion of the third day.

On the second day, they used 10 less bandages than the day before. In total, they used 28 bandages.\n3. On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages, and used only half a pack which equals to 25 bandages.\n4. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n5. Count backward: add up all the bandages they used and bought, then subtract the leftover bandages. The result will be the amount they had initially.\n\nLet's write python code to get the solution. \n\n```python\n# define the bandages per a large pack\npack = 50\n\n# calculate bandages bought and used in three days\nfirst_day = pack - 38\nsecond_day = first_day - 28\nthird_day = second_day + 2*pack - pack/2\n\n# calculate the bandages they had initially\ninitial_bandages = third_day + 78\nprint(initial_bandages)\n```\nTry to run the above python code to get the solution.

After the consumption of 38 bandages, they purchased an extra 50 bandages. - This gives us (X+50-38) bandages left.\n2. On day two, they used 10 less bandages than the day before. -  This leaves us with (X+50-38-28) bandages.\n3. On day three, they bought two large packs of bandages and only used half a pack. - This gives us (X+50-38-28+100-25) bandages.\n4. At the end of the third day, there were 78 bandages left, which are the remaining bandages they have. By balancing the bandages, we get X as the initial bandages.\n\nAt the beginning of the first day, they had \boxed{137} bandages."
