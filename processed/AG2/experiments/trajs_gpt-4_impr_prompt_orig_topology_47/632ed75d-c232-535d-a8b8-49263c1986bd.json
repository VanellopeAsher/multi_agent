Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "Okay, with the value 11 as the number of daily flights from the first aircraft to France, I will now verify these steps.\n\n**Verification**\n1. The number of flights from the second aircraft to Poland (44) is given.\n2. The number of flights from the first aircraft is twice the second aircraft's number of flights to Poland. That means the first aircraft flies 2 * 44 = 88 flights per day.\n3. It's given that the first aircraft flies three-fourths of its total flights to Greece. So, 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights are flown to Greece.\n4. The remaining flights, 88 - 66 = 22 are shared equally between France and Germany.\n5. Hence, the first aircraft flies 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.\n\nEverything seems to align perfectly with the above calculations. The operations appear to be in order and the output corroborates with previous calculations.\n\nSo the first aircraft makes 11 flights daily  to France.\nThus, the final answer is 11.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{11}."
