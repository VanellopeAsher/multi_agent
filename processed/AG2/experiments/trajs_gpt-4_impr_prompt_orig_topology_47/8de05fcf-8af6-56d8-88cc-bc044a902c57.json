Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "Key Idea: We will first calculate the total number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday and Tuesday, and then determine how many hours she spent on articles on these days. We will subtract this time from the total time supplied to get how many hours were spent on Wednesday. Given that one piece takes 4 hours to write, we can determine the number of articles written on Wednesday. Comparing this number to the number of articles written on Tuesday will give us the answer.\n\nStep 1: Let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day. \n```python\n# number of articles written on Monday\nnum_on_Monday = 5\n\n# number of articles written on Tuesday\nnum_on_Tuesday = 2/5 * num_on_Monday + num_on_Monday\n```\nStep 2: Compute how many hours she spent writing on Monday and Tuesday and determine how many hours she spent on Wednesday. \nCompute the total hours as well. \n\n```python\n# hours spent writing on Monday and Tuesday\nhours_on_Mon_Tue = 4 * (num_on_Monday + num_on_Tuesday)\n\n# total hours spent writing\ntotal_hours = 104\n\n# hours spent writing on Wednesday\nhours_on_Wednesday = total_hours - hours_on_Mon_Tue\n```\nStep 3: Compute the number of articles written on Wednesday and find out how many times as many articles did she write on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\n```python\n# number of articles written on Wednesday\nnum_on_Wednesday = hours_on_Wednesday / 4\n\n# how many times as many articles did she write on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday\ntimes_more_articles = num_on_Wednesday / num_on_Tuesday\n```"

      "content": "VERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify the results step by step:\n\n1. As per the problem, Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Hence, as calculated, she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.\n\n2. Writing time per article is 4 hours, thus \n   she spent 5*4 = 20 hours on Monday and \n   7*4 = 28 hours on Tuesday.\n\n3. Combining time spent for both days gives us 20 + 28 = 48 hours.\n\n4. As provided, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles on the three days. If she spent 48 hours on Monday and Tuesday, then \n   the hours spent on Wednesday is 104 - 48 = 56 hours.\n\n5. Considering each article takes 4 hours to write, Meredith wrote 14 (i.e. 56/4) articles on Wednesday. \n\n6. Consequently, Meredith wrote 2 (i.e. 14/7) times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\nOverall, the calculations have been verified and are correct. Consequently, the answer is Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: \\boxed{2}."
