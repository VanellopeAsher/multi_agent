Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full three times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?"

      "content": "Let's use the Direct Python Solution approach because this problem is straightforward and no special reasoning or step-by-step process is needed to solve it.\n\nKey Idea: A full alphabet has 26 letters. \n\nThe Plan: \n1. Calculate the total number of letters she wrote at each stage.\n2. Find the sum of what she had written before rewriting\n3. Finally, calculate the total number of letters by including the ones she rewrote.\n\nThis can be articulated in Python as follows:\n\n```python\n# Number of letters in the alphabet\nletters_in_alphabet = 26\n\n# Number of times she wrote the full alphabet\nfull_alphabets = 3\n\n# Number of times she wrote half the alphabet\nhalf_alphabet = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of letters she wrote\ntotal_letters_before_rewriting = (full_alphabets * letters_in_alphabet) + (half_alphabet * (letters_in_alphabet/2))\n\n# Number of letters after re-writing everything she had already written\ntotal_letters = total_letters_before_rewriting * 2\n\n# Display result\nprint(total_letters)\n```\n\nUpon running this code, we will get the desired total number of letters.\n"

She wrote half the alphabet (13 letters) once: 1 * 13 = 13\n3. She then rewrote everything she had written. Initially, she had written 78 + 13 = 91 letters. \n4. The total number of letters after rewriting everything is then: 91 * 2 = 182 letters.\n\nTherefore, our calculation is correct. The final answer is \\boxed{182}."
