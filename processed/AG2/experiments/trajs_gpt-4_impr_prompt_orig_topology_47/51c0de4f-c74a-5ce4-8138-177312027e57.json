Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money. If Walter's lawyer contributed $6600 in total, how much did his friend give him?"

This implies that the lawyer's donation is three times the sum of the donations from the neighbors, the online fund, and the friend. \n\nSo, we have this equation:\n6600 = 3 * (500 + 1500 + x)\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the value of \"x\", which represents the amount of money Walter's friend gave."

The amount of money from the online fund is: $1500\n3. The amount of money from Walter's friend is: $200\n\nThe total amount donated by others (neighbors + online fund + friend) is: $500 + $1500 + $200 \n                                                                                             = $2200\n\nAccording to the problem, the lawyer donates three times as much as everyone else. Hence, the lawyer's donation should be: $2200 * 3 = $6600\n\nFrom the above confirmation, we can see that the contribution of the lawyer exactly matches the donation mentioned in the problem. So, we are confident that the result is correct.\n\nHence, the final answer is:\nWalter's friend gave him $200 for charity. \n\nThis can be written as $\\boxed{200}$."
