Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. If they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that amount on Friday, how many chimichangas do they make on Tuesday?"

      "content": "Let `x` denote the number of chimichangas produced on Tuesday. Given that the number of chimichangas produced on Wednesday is the same as on Tuesday, we can define Wednesday's production as `x` as well. According to the problem, Aggie Burrito Shop makes twice as many chimichangas on Friday than it does on Tuesday or Wednesday. Thus, we can denote Friday's production as `2x`.\n\nThis result in the following equation: `x (Tuesday) + x (Wednesday) + 2x (Friday) = 500`. So, our key idea will be to solve this equation for `x`, which will give us the number of chimichangas produced on Tuesday.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\nequation = Eq(x + x + 2*x, 500)\nsolution = solve(equation, x)[0]\nprint(\"Burritos made on Tuesday : \", solution)\n```"

Now let's verify the result.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n- Rechecking the original problem, we know that the number of burritos produced on Tuesday and Wednesday are identical, and twice as many are made on Friday. \n- We solved the equation `x (Tuesday) + x (Wednesday) + 2x (Friday) = 500` to find `x`, representing the production on Tuesday, equals 125. \n- If we plug `x` (125) back into the equation, we get: `125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500`, which verifies that our solution for `x` is correct.\n\nThus, the final answer is that the shop makes \boxed{125} chimichangas on Tuesday."
