Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. If a 10% tax is applied to all items that are not food, what is the total cost of all the items?"

      "content": "Key Idea: \nThe key idea behind this problem is to distinguish between the items that are food and those that are not. The tax is only applied to non-food items. Once we have separated the items into these two categories, we can compute the total cost for each, including the tax for non-food items, and then add them together for the final total cost.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nWe'll use a direct Python solution for this problem. We need to calculate the price of items without and with tax and sum them up. We assume that milk and eggs are food while light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are not food.\n\nCalculation Plan:\n1. Compute the total cost of the food items.\n2. Compute the total cost of the non-food items. \n3. Apply a 10% tax to the total cost of non-food items.\n4. Sum the total cost of food items and the taxed cost of non-food items to get the final total cost. \n\nHere is the Python code implementing this plan. \n\n```python\n# Define costs of items\ncost_milk = 2\ncost_eggs = 3\ncost_bulbs = 3\ncost_cups = 3\ncost_traps = 4\n\n# Calculate total cost for food and non-food items\ntotal_food = cost_milk + cost_eggs\ntotal_non_food = cost_bulbs + cost_cups + cost_traps\n\n# Apply 10% tax to non-food items\ntaxed_non_food = total_non_food * 1.1\n\n# Calculate total cost of all items\ntotal_cost = total_food + taxed_non_food\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nVerification Steps:\n1. We'll run the code and verify that the calculations are correct.\n2. Check that the tax is correctly computed and applied only to non-food items.\n3. Confirm that the final total cost is the sum of the cost of food items and the taxed cost of non-food items. \n\nThe final answer will be the output of the print statement."
