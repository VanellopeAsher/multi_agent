Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30.

      "content": "Key Idea or Concept:\nThis problem can be modeled using a system of linear equations. Specifically, we can use the equation `40x + 30*80 = 3200` where `x` is the number of tomato seed packets that Mrs. Rylan bought.\n\nSolution:\nLet's solve the equation using Python:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Declare the variable\nx = sp.symbols(\"x\")\n\n# Formulate the equation\nequation = sp.Eq(40*x + 30*80, 3200)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = sp.solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nIf you run the Python code above and `solution` doesn't equal an integer or if it's in a fraction form, convert it to its simplest form and print it again."

I'll explain it differently:\n\nBy substituting 20 (the number of tomato packets) back into the equation,\n\n40*20 + 30*80 - This should equal 3200.\n\nRunning that calculation gives us:\n\n800 + 2400\n\nWhich equals 3200.\n\nSo, given there's no difference between the left (the calculated total cost after substituting in number of tomato packets) and the right (the total cost given in the problem) sides of the equation, we can confidently say that the solution is verified and correct.\n\nSo, the number of tomato seed packets that Mrs. Rylan bought was indeed \\boxed{20}."
