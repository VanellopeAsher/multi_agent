Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

The steps to solve are as follows:\n\n- Since Claire eats a 3 egg omelet every day, we need to calculate how many eggs she consumes in 12 weeks.\n- As there are 7 days in a week and 12 weeks, Claire will consume 3 eggs * 7 days * 12 weeks.\n- As a dozen is considered as 12 items, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she consumes.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# eggs consumed per day\neggs_per_day = 3 \n\n# days in a week\ndays_per_week = 7 \n\n# total weeks\ntotal_weeks = 12 \n\n# compute total eggs consumed\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_day * days_per_week * total_weeks \n\n# compute dozens consumed\ndozen_eggs = total_eggs / 12 # 1 dozen equals 12 eggs\n\nprint(dozen_eggs)\n```"
