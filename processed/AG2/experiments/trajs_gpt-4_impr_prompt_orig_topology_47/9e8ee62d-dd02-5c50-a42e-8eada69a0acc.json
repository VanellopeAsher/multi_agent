Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another inches in the third week and the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inces tall. How many inches did the beanstalk grow in the third week?"

We can then subtract the height of the beanstalk after the second week from its overall 3-week height (10 inches) to obtain the amount it grew in the third week.\n\n```python\n# Initial height of the beanstalk\ninitial_height = 3\n\n# Height of the beanstalk after second week (double of first week)\nsecond_week_height = initial_height*2 \n\n# Total height of the beanstalk after three weeks\ntotal_height = 10 \n\n# Growth in the third week\nthird_week_growth = total_height - second_week_height \nprint(third_week_growth)\n```"

      "content": "Now that you have successfully computed the growth of the beanstalk in the third week, it's time to verify the result. \n\nVERIFICATION\n\n- The beanstalk was initially 3 inches tall. \n- In the second week, it doubled its height, becoming 6 inches tall. \n- The beanstalk's height after three weeks is given as 10 inches. \n\nTherefore, the growth in the third week is obtained by subtracting the height after the second week from the total height after three weeks. \n\n10 inches (total height after 3 weeks) - 6 inches (height after the second week) = 4 inches \n\nOur computations match this logic, indicating that the growth of the beanstalk in the third week is indeed 4 inches. \n\nThus, we have the final answer: The beanstalk grew \\boxed{4} inches in the third week."
