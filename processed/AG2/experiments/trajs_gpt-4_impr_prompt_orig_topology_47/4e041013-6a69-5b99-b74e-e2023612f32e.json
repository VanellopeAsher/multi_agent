Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden. He can accommodate 6 red tulips per row and 8 blue tulips per row. If Jackson purchases 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of tulips will he end up planting?"

      "content": "Approach:\nThis problem can be solved by simple division. We have to find the number of rows of red tulips by dividing the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row. Then, we do the same for the blue tulips. Finally, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to get the total number of rows.\n\nHere is the Python code which performs these operations.\n\n```python\n# number of tulips\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\n\n# tulips per row\nred_per_row = 6\nblue_per_row = 8\n\n# number of rows\nred_rows = red_tulips / red_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips / blue_per_row\n\n# total rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nThis script calculates the number of rows of red and blue tulips and then adds them up. The result will be the total number of rows for planting tulips."
