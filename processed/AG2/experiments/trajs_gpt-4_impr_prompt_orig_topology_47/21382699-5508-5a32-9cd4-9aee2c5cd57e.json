Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now."

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to understand that the ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means that Darrell's age is represented as 7x and Allen's age as 11x. Since the total age states that 7x + 11x = 162, we can solve for x and then find Allen's age. After that, we add 10 years to find Allen's age 10 years from now.\n\nFirst, we will solve for x using sympy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# equation representing total age\neq = Eq(7*x + 11*x, 162)\n\n# solve for x\nx_val = solve(eq)[0]\n\nprint(x_val)\n```\n\nUpon obtaining the value for x, we can then calculate Allen's age by multiplying x_val by 11 and then add 10 years to find Allen's age in the future.\n\n```python\n# calculate Allen's current age\nallen_age_now = 11 * x_val\n\n# calculate Allen's age 10 years from now\nallen_age_future = allen_age_now + 10\n\nprint(allen_age_future)\n```"

We set up the ratio of Darrel and Allen's ages as 7x and 11x respectively.\n2. Given that their total age is 162, we set up the equation 7x + 11x = 162.\n3. Solving this equation, we found x = 9.\n4. Using x, we calculated Allen's current age as 11x = 11*9 = 99.\n5.
