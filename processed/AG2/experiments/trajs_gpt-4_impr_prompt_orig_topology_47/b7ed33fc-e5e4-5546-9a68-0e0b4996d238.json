Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

Identify the time taken to complete a normal sudoku puzzle which we already know is 30 minutes.\n2. Identify how long an extreme sudoku puzzle takes by multiplying the time for a normal sudoku puzzle by 3.\n3. Find out how many bottles of water John drinks by identifying how many half hours are in the total time spent solving the sudoku puzzles.\n\nLet's put these steps into action."

      "content": "Okay, let's find out how long an extreme sudoku puzzle takes and calculate how many bottles of water John drinks while completing it.\n\n```python\n# Define the time taken for a normal sudoku puzzle in minutes\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30  # minutes\n\n# Define the time taken for an extreme sudoku puzzle in minutes\nextreme_sudoku_time = normal_sudoku_time * 3  # minutes\n\n# Define the time taken to drink a bottle of water in minutes\nbottle_drinking_time = 30  # minutes\n\n# Calculate the number of bottles John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle\nbottles_drunk = extreme_sudoku_time / bottle_drinking_time\nprint(bottles_drunk)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of bottles John drinks while completing an extreme sudoku. Thus, the final answer should be the value stored in the `bottles_drunk` variable. To verify, we need to make sure that the calculations accurately reflect the given problem conditions and use correct math operations. Also, because the variables represent time in minutes and the rate of drinking, we should expect a whole number as an answer."
