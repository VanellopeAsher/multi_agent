Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach:\n\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution\n\nKey idea: \nWe have 200 children divided equally into boys and girls, so there are 100 boys and 100 girls. Each boy brought back 600 shells while each girl brought back (600 + 4*600) shells. To find out the number of shells brought by each girl, we simply need to calculate 600 + 4*600 which will give us the number of shells brought by each girl.\n\nPython Code:\n\n```python\n# the number of shells brought by each boy\nshells_each_boy = 600\n\n# the number of shells brought by each girl\nshells_each_girl = shells_each_boy + 4 * shells_each_boy\n\nprint ('The number of shells brought by each girl is', shells_each_girl)\n```"

Now that we have computed the number of shells brought by each girl, let's proceed with the verification step. \n\nVerification Steps :\nThe problem states that each girl brought back the number of shells brought by each boy plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Since each boy brought back 600 shells, the total number of shells brought by each girl should be 600 + 4*600 = 3000 \n\nSo the final answer is âŽ•3000.\n\nThis matches the computed value. Therefore, each girl brought back 3000 seashells. Our Python calculation and reasoning are both correct."
