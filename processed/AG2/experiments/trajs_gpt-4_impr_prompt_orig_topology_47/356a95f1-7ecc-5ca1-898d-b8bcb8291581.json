Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 80 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?"

If Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam, then we can represent the shares of Sam and Harry as follows: \n\n1. Sam's share: x\n2. Harry's share: x + 80\n\nSince the total length is 200 feet, we have \n\nx (Sam's share) + x + 80 (Harry's share) = 200\n\nThis leads to the equation 2x + 80 = 200\n\nLet's solve this equation for x. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\neq = Eq(2*x + 80, 200)\nsolution = solve(eq, x)\nprint(solution[0])\n```"

To verify let's check to prove if:\n\n1. Sam's share + Harry's share = total length of fence\n2. Harry's share - Sam's share = 80 feet\n\nWe can use simple equations to perform this verification.\n\n```python\n# Verification\nsam_share = solution[0]\nharry_share = sam_share + 80\n\n# Check if the total length is valid\nprint(sam_share + harry_share == 200)\n\n# Check if Harry's share is indeed 80 feet more than Sam's share\nprint(harry_share - sam_share == 80)\n```"
