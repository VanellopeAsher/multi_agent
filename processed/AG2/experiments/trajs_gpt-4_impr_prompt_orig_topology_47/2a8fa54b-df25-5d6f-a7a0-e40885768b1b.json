Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten. If the mean score is 70, what's the forgortten score?"

The concept applied here is the definition of the arithmetic mean, which we derive by dividing the sum of all elements in a set by the number of elements in the set.\n\nWe are given the mean score and the number of scores. We can use these values to calculate the total sum of all scores. We can then subtract the sum of the given scores from the total sum to find the forgotten score.\n\n# Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. Calculate the total sum of all scores using the formula: total_sum = mean * count.\n2. Calculate the sum of the given scores.\n3. Subtract the sum of the given scores from the total sum to find out the forgotten score.\n\n# Working with Python\n\nThe problem can be solved using Python by first implementing a list to hold the given scores. Then calculate the total sum of all scores and subtract it by the sum of the known scores. \n\nLet's implement this solution."
