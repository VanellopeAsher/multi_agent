Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach:\n\nThis problem can be solved using a Direct Python solution. The key idea here is to use the given rates of change (degrees per hour) and the durations (hours) to find the total change in degrees. After that, we need to add the initial degrees to the total to determine the final position of the sun.\n\nPython Solution:\n\n```python\n# constants\ninitial_degrees = 32\nfirst_rate = 5\nfirst_duration = 10\nsecond_rate = 3\nsecond_duration = 2\n\n# calculate total change\ntotal_change = (first_rate * first_duration) + (second_rate * second_duration)\n\n# calculate final position in degrees\nfinal_degrees = initial_degrees + total_change\n\nprint ('Final Position of the Sun in Degrees: ', final_degrees)\n```"

      "content": "VERIFICATION\n\n1. The sun starts at 32 degrees from the ground. \n2. For the first 10 hours, the sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. The total change in degrees is 5 * 10 = 50 degrees. Thus, the angle from the ground becomes 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.\n3. For the next 2 hours, the sun moves at a rate of 3 degrees per hour. The total change in degrees is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Thus, the final angle from the ground becomes 82 + 6 = 88 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the correct final position of the sun in degrees from the ground is 88 degrees, which matches the presented solution.\n\nFinal Answer: \nThe final position of the sun in degrees from the ground is $\\boxed{88}$ degrees."
