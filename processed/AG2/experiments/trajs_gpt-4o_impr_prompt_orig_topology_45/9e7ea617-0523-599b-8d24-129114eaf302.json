Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 60 feet, and the second tree has a height of 50 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a direct Python solution. We are given the heights of three trees in Eddy's backyard. We need to find out the height of the tallest tree, given the following information:\n\n1. The height of the shortest tree is 60 feet.\n2. The second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest tree.\n3. The tallest tree is twice the height of the first two trees combined.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step and solve it using Python with the help of the `sympy` library. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbolic variable for the height of the tallest tree\ntallest_tree_height = symbols('tallest_tree_height')\n\n# Shortest tree height\nshortest_tree_height = 60\n\n# Second tree height\nsecond_tree_height = shortest_tree_height + 50\n\n# Total height of the first two trees\ncombined_height = shortest_tree_height + second_tree_height\n\n# Equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(tallest_tree_height, 2 * combined_height)\n\n# Solve for the height of the tallest tree\nsolution = solve(equation, tallest_tree_height)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the height of the second tree:**\n   - The second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest tree, so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Second tree height} = 60 + 50 = 110\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the combined height of the first two trees:**\n   - Add the heights of the shortest and the second tree:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Combined height} = 60 + 110 = 170\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the height of the tallest tree:**\n   - The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the first two:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tallest tree height} = 2 \\times 170 = 340\n     \\]\n\nEverything checks out with the code, and hence, the tallest tree is 340 feet tall.\n\n\\(\\boxed{340}\\)"
