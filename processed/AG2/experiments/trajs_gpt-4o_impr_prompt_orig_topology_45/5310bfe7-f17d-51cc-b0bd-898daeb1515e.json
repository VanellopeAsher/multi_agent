Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 30 more goals than Mark and scored 55 more goals than Anna. If Richie scored 90 goals, how many goals did all three teenagers score?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a direct Python solution approach with basic algebra:\n\n1. **Understand the relationships**: \n   - Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n   - Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\n2. **Set up the equations**:\n   - Let \\( R \\) be the number of goals Richie scored, \\( M \\) be the number of goals Mark scored, and \\( A \\) be the number of goals Anna scored.\n   - We have: \n     \\[\n     R = M + 30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     R = A + 55\n     \\]\n   - Given that Richie scored 90 goals: \\( R = 90 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\( M \\) and \\( A \\)**:\n   - Using \\( R = M + 30 \\) and substituting \\( R = 90 \\): \n     \\[\n     90 = M + 30 \\Rightarrow M = 90 - 30 = 60\n     \\]\n   - Using \\( R = A + 55 \\) and substituting \\( R = 90 \\): \n     \\[\n     90 = A + 55 \\Rightarrow A = 90 - 55 = 35\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total goals**:\n   - Total goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total} = R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35 = 185\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python using the instructions provided:\n\n```python\n# Assign Richie's score\nR = 90\n\n# Calculate Mark's and Anna's scores\nM = R - 30\nA = R - 55\n\n# Calculate the total number of goals\ntotal_goals = R + M + A\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_goals)\n```\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Richie's goals**: Given as 90.\n2. **Mark's goals**: \\( M = 90 - 30 = 60 \\). Verified as correct.\n3. **Anna's goals**: \\( A = 90 - 55 = 35 \\). Verified as correct.\n4. **Total goals**: \\( 90 + 60 + 35 = 185 \\). Verified as correct.\n\nFinally, the confirmed total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \\(\\boxed{185}\\)."
