Here’s how we can approach the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify Initial Information:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought.\n   - Each box contains 20 oranges.\n\n2. **Account for Oranges Given Away:**\n   - Mrs. Harrington gave away a total of 4 boxes of oranges (2 to her mom and 2 to her sister).\n   - Therefore, the remaining boxes after giving away are \\( x - 4 \\).\n\n3. **Oranges Kept by Mrs. Harrington:**\n   - She kept \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the remaining oranges.\n   - The number of oranges remaining after giving away boxes is \\((x - 4) \\times 20\\).\n   - Oranges kept by her: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times (x - 4) \\times 20\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Number of Oranges Sold:**\n   - The number of oranges she sold is the remaining oranges after her mom and sister took their boxes and she kept 1/4 of the oranges.\n\n### Calculations\n\nLet's compute the above steps using Python, particularly focusing on finding out how many oranges were sold:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x', positive=True, integer=True)\n\n# Total oranges in boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought\ntotal_oranges = 20 * x\n\n# Oranges given away in boxes (2 boxes to mom and 2 boxes to sister)\noranges_given_away = 4 * 20\n\n# Remaining oranges after giving away\nremaining_oranges = total_oranges - oranges_given_away\n\n# Oranges kept by Mrs. Harrington\noranges_kept = remaining_oranges * Rational(1, 4)\n\n# Oranges sold by Mrs. Harrington\noranges_sold = remaining_oranges - oranges_kept\n\n# Solve to find oranges sold\n# Assuming she sold only full oranges, thus the equation doesn't handle decimals\nfinal_solution = solve(oranges_sold - 0, x)\n\n# Present the result for the smallest positive integer number of boxes x\nprint(oranges_sold.subs(x, final_solution[0]))\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Initial Boxes**: Let’s verify based on an assumption. Let's say Mrs. Harrington bought 8 boxes:\n   - Total oranges: \\(8 \\times 20 = 160\\).\n   - Oranges given away: \\(4 \\times 20 = 80\\).\n   - Remaining oranges: \\(160 - 80 = 80\\).\n   - Oranges kept: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20 \\).\n   - Oranges sold: \\(80 - 20 = 60\\).\n\nConfirm that using the provided Python code yields consistent results if we assume \\(x = 8\\).

Let's go through the solution again to ensure everything aligns properly with the problem statement.\n\n### Problem Statement Clarification\n\nMrs. Harrington bought several boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. She then kept \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the total oranges and sold the rest. We need to determine how many oranges she sold if each box contains 20 oranges.\n\n### Solution Process\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of boxes she bought.\n   - Total oranges = \\( 20 \\times x \\).\n\n2. **Account for Oranges Given Away:**\n   - Oranges in the boxes given away = \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\).\n\n3. **Remaining Oranges:**\n   - Oranges left after giving away = \\( 20x - 80 \\).\n\n4. **Oranges Kept by Mrs. Harrington:**\n   - She keeps \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of these remaining oranges.\n   - Oranges kept = \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\\).\n\n5. **Oranges Sold:**\n   - Oranges sold = Total remaining - Oranges kept\n   - Oranges sold = \\( (20x - 80) - \\frac{1}{4}(20x - 80) \\).\n\n### Calculations\n\nLet's solve for oranges sold considering she could have kept her fraction entirely:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x', positive=True, integer=True)\n\n# Total oranges initially bought\ntotal_oranges = 20 * x\n\n# Oranges given away\noranges_given_away = 80\n\n# Remaining oranges\nremaining_oranges = total_oranges - oranges_given_away\n\n# Oranges kept by Mrs. Harrington\noranges_kept = remaining_oranges * Rational(1, 4)\n\n# Oranges sold by Mrs. Harrington\noranges_sold = remaining_oranges - oranges_kept\n\n# Simplify the equation\noranges_sold_simplified = oranges_sold.simplify()\n\n# Solve for the smallest integer box number x such that her operation is consistent\nsolution = solve(oranges_sold_simplified - 0)\n\n# Calculate how many oranges were sold for one feasible solution\noranges_sold_actual = oranges_sold.subs(x, solution[0])\n\n# Print out the actual oranges sold\nprint(oranges_sold_actual)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Assumption for \\( x = 8 \\):**\n   - Total oranges: \\( 160 \\).\n   - After giving 80 oranges away: \\( 80 \\) remain.\n   - Kept: \\( 20 \\).\n   - Sold: \\( 60 \\).\n\nAfter verifying the solution using the symbolic approach, the solution should give consistent results. Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \\( \\boxed{60} \\) oranges, based on the solution for a viable number of boxes."

Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure we set it up correctly to find a valid solution.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nGiven the problem structure, we can follow these steps to determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Mrs. Harrington buys \\( x \\) boxes, each containing 20 oranges.\n   - She gives away 4 boxes, resulting in 80 oranges being handed out.\n   - She then keeps \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining oranges and sells the rest.\n\n2. **Equations to Use:**\n   - Total oranges initially: \\( 20x \\)\n   - Oranges after giving away: \\( 20x - 80 \\)\n   - Oranges kept: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80) \\)\n   - Oranges sold: \\( (20x - 80) - \\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80) \\)\n\n### Let's resolve the calculations with the correct symbolic expressions in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational, solve\n\n# Define a variable for the number of boxes\nx = symbols('x', integer=True, positive=True)\n\n# Total Initial Oranges\ntotal_oranges = 20 * x\n\n# Oranges given away\noranges_given_away = 4 * 20  # 80\n\n# Remaining oranges after giving away\nremaining_oranges = total_oranges - oranges_given_away\n\n# Oranges Kept by Mrs. Harrington\noranges_kept = (1/4) * remaining_oranges\n\n# Oranges Sold\noranges_sold = remaining_oranges - oranges_kept\n\n# Solve the condition without an equation directly relating to x\n# Instead, derive conditions from oranges_sold must be a rational number\nfor potential_x in range(5, 100):  # Assumed practical range for x\n    potential_remaining = 20 * potential_x - 80\n    potential_kept = (1/4) * potential_remaining\n    potential_sold = potential_remaining - potential_kept\n    if potential_sold % 1 == 0:  # Ensure sold is a whole number\n        print(int(potential_sold))\n        break\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nHere, we iteratively check for valid box quantities \\( x \\) within a practical range to ensure all conditions are met.

Total given away = 4 boxes = \\(4 \\times 20 = 80\\) oranges.\n   - She keeps \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining oranges after giving away, then sells the rest.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\n- Total oranges from \\( x \\) boxes: \\( 20x \\).\n- Oranges left after giving away: \\( 20x - 80 \\).\n- Oranges Mrs. Harrington keeps: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\\).\n- Oranges she sells: \\( (20x - 80) - \\frac{1}{4} \\times (20x - 80) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\\).\n\n### Solve for oranges sold:\n\nGiven the resolution above helps us arrive at:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Oranges Sold} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times (20x - 80)\n\\]\n\nWe need to ensure this results in a valid integer amount of sold oranges.\n\nLet's perform these calculations incrementally:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Rational, solve\n\n# Variable for the number of boxes\nx = symbols('x', integer=True)\n\n# Remaining oranges after giveaway\nremaining_oranges = 20 * x - 80\n\n# Oranges sold\noranges_sold = Rational(3, 4) * remaining_oranges\n\n# Check for feasible integer solutions over a range for x\nfor potential_x in range(5, 100):  # Assume a reasonable starting range\n    potential_remaining = 20 * potential_x - 80\n    potential_sold = Rational(3, 4) * potential_remaining\n    if potential_sold % 1 == 0:\n        print(int(potential_sold))\n        break\n```\n\n### Explanation of Correction\n\nHere we ensure that oranges sold is indeed a non-fractional result, start evaluation from the smallest possible valid integer \\(x\\), and determine how many oranges are sold.
