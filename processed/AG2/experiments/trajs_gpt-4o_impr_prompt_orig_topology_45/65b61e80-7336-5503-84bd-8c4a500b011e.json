Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of eggs the friends found based on the information given.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n\n1. **Eggs Found by the Smith Twins:**\n   - Each Smith twin found 30 eggs.\n   - Total eggs found by the twins = \\(30 + 30 = 60\\).\n\n2. **Eggs Found by Friends:**\n   - We denote the total number of eggs hidden as \\(E\\).\n   - The statement \"all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends\" implies that 10 eggs were not found by anyone.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Variables:**\n   - Total eggs found (by both the twins and their friends) = Total eggs hidden - Eggs not found.\n   - Therefore: \n     \\[\n     \\text{{Eggs found by friends}} = (E - 10) - 60\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving for Eggs Found by Friends:**\n   - We don't have \\(E\\), but we can express the eggs found by friends purely in terms of \\(E\\).\n\n### Solution Implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the total number of eggs as a symbol\nE = symbols('E')\n\n# Total eggs found by both twins and friends is E - 10\n# Eggs found by twins: 60\n# Thus, eggs found by friends = (E - 10) - 60\neggs_found_by_friends_expr = (E - 10) - 60\n\n# Simplify the expression\neggs_found_by_friends_simplified = eggs_found_by_friends_expr.simplify()\n\n# Since the solutions need to be in terms of E, let's just display the expression.\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends_simplified)\n```\n\nHowever, since the actual value of \\(E\\) (the total number of eggs hidden) is not provided, we cannot resolve this to a fixed numerical answer without additional information. Therefore, in terms of expression, the eggs found by friends can be determined by further input about the total number of eggs hidden.\n\nHere, we conclude that the information is incomplete to find a numerical answer. Thus, the solution to the number of eggs found by friends is in terms of \\(E\\) as shown by our Python expression.\n\n\\[ E - 70 \\]\n\nIf no total \\(E\\) is provided, the numerical solution cannot be fixed. Therefore, given the lack of \\(E\\), the resolution is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None}} \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Before stating \"None\", verify if all information and logical steps were correctly represented and given data limitations acknowledged. The problem requires knowing \\({E}\\) to evaluate.\n- Re-check: 60 eggs are accounted for by the twins, 10 are leftover implying all else goes to friends, but still \\({E}\\) is integral for full computation without institutional assumption. Hence without \\({E}\\), the boxed response is apt."

      "content": "Let's calculate the number of eggs found by the friends with more clarity. \n\nTo find the number of eggs the friends found, let's recap:\n\n1. **Eggs Found by the Smith Twins:**\n   - The Smith twins found a total of 60 eggs together (30 each).\n\n2. **Understanding the Problem Statement:**\n   - All eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends.\n\n3. **Calculation of Eggs Found by Friends:**\n   - Since 10 eggs were not found, the rest were found.\n   - Total eggs found = Total eggs - 10.\n\nGiven that the eggs found by the twins are 60:\n\n\\[ (\\text{Eggs found by twins} + \\text{Eggs found by friends}) = (\\text{Total eggs} - 10) \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is:\n\n\\[ E - 70 \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's step through the arithmetic:\n\n1. Total eggs known as \\(E\\).\n2. Unfound eggs are 10.\n3. Eggs found by twins = 60.\n4. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Eggs found by friends} = (E - 10) - 60 = E - 70\n   \\]\n\nThe expression \\(E - 70\\) correctly represents the number of eggs found by the friends.\n\nFinally, the answer in terms of \\(E\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E - 70} \\]"
