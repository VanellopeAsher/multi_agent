      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMartha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 12 families with 6 people and 15 families with 4 people. 16 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many people show up for Martha's party, we can follow a step-by-step approach.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Invited Guests:**\n   - There are 12 families with 6 people each.\n   - There are 15 families with 4 people each.\n   - Calculate the total number of invited guests by multiplying the number of families by the number of people in each family and then summing the results.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Cancellations:**\n   - 16 people couldn't attend due to illness.\n   - 1/4 of those who couldn't attend due to illness had previous commitments.\n   - Calculate the total number of people who couldn't attend by adding the numbers due to illness and previous commitments.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Attendees:**\n   - Subtract the total number of cancellations from the total number of invited guests to get the number of attendees.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate total invited guests\nfamilies_with_6 = 12\nmembers_per_family_6 = 6\nfamilies_with_4 = 15\nmembers_per_family_4 = 4\n\ntotal_invited = (families_with_6 * members_per_family_6) + (families_with_4 * members_per_family_4)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total cancellations\npeople_ill = 16\npeople_previous_commitments = Rational(1, 4) * people_ill  # 1/4 of those who were ill\ntotal_cancellations = people_ill + people_previous_commitments\n\n# Step 3: Calculate number of attendees\nattendees = total_invited - total_cancellations\n\n# Output the number of attendees\nprint(attendees)\n```\n\nBy executing this code, we can determine the exact number of people who will show up at the party.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Total Invited Guests:**\n   - Calculation: \\(12 \\times 6 + 15 \\times 4\\)\n   - Result: \\(72 + 60 = 132\\) guests.\n\n2. **Total Cancellations:**\n   - People who are ill: 16.\n   - People with previous commitments: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4\\).\n   - Total cancellations: \\(16 + 4 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Final Attending Count:**\n   - Total attendees: \\(132 - 20 = 112\\).\n\nAfter verifying each of these calculations, we can confidently say that the number of people who show up at Martha's party is \\(\\boxed{112}\\)."
