Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 100 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 120 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?"

      "content": "Let's solve the problem using the Direct Python Solution approach, as it involves straightforward arithmetic calculations.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nWe need to determine how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw during their water balloon fight. We can find this by calculating the total number of balloons initially and then subtracting the number of balloons left at the end. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total initial number of balloons.\n2. Subtract the remaining number of balloons from the total to find the number of balloons thrown.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Jolene and her friends fill up 10 packs of balloons.\n2. Each pack contains 100 balloons.\n3. Therefore, the total initial number of balloons is \\(10 \\times 100 = 1000\\).\n\n**Remaining Balloons:**\n- At the end of the day, they have 120 balloons left.\n\n**Number of Balloons Thrown:**\n- Total balloons thrown = Total initial balloons - Remaining balloons\n- Balloons thrown = \\(1000 - 120\\)\n\n**Let's calculate this using Python and get the result.**\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of balloons thrown\ntotal_packs = 10\nballoons_per_pack = 100\nremaining_balloons = 120\n\n# Total initial number of balloons\ntotal_balloons = total_packs * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Number of balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - remaining_balloons\n\n# Output the result\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet's go through our steps to verify the solution:\n\n1. Total number of balloons filled: \\(10\\) packs \\(\\times 100\\) balloons per pack = \\(1000\\) balloons.\n2. Number of balloons left after the fight: \\(120\\).\n3. Calculation of balloons thrown: \\(1000 - 120 = 880\\).\n\nSince each step and the calculation have been verified to be correct, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{880}\\)"
