Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of work required to paint the entire house based on the given information and then calculate how long it will take for a team of 5 people to complete that work.\n\n### Problem-Solving Approach\n\n**Key Idea:**\nThe problem involves determining work rates and calculating the combined work rate for a team.\n\n1. **Determine Individual Work Rate:**\n   - A single person completes half of the house in 5 days. Therefore, the individual can complete the entire house in \\(2 \\times 5\\) days.\n\n2. **Calculate Individual Work Rate per Day:**\n   - In terms of the whole house, the work rate of one person is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of the house per day since it takes 10 days to complete the whole house.\n\n3. **Calculate the Team's Work Rate:**\n   - For a team of 5 individuals, their combined work rate is \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the house per day.\n\n4. **Calculate the Time for the Team to Complete the Work:**\n   - Since the team can paint \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the house per day, it will take them 2 days to complete the entire house (since \\(\\frac{1}{1/2} = 2\\)).\n\n5. **Convert Days to Hours:**\n   - Assuming a standard workday is 24 hours, 2 days correspond to \\(2 \\times 24\\) hours.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic computation\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the work rate of one person\none_person_rate = Rational(1, 10)  # House per day\n\n# Calculate the combined work rate of 5 people\nteam_rate = 5 * one_person_rate  # House per day\n\n# Calculate the number of days for the team to complete one whole house\ndays_to_complete = Rational(1, team_rate)\n\n# Assuming a 24-hour work day\nhours_to_complete = days_to_complete * 24\n\n# Print the result in fractions\nprint(hours_to_complete)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Reviewed the conversion of individual work to a group work rate: \\( \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n2. Ensured correct conversion of days for the team to complete the work: \\( 2 \\) days.\n3. Checked the multiplication for converting days into hours: \\( 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\) hours.\n\nThe calculated time for 5 individuals to paint the entire house is \\( \\boxed{48} \\) hours."
