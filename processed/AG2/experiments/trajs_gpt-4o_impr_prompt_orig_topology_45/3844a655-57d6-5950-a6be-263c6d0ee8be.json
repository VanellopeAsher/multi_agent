Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's define the costs associated with each venue and set them equal to find the number of guests required for the costs to be the same.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe need to establish the cost functions for each venue and solve for the number of guests where these costs are equal.\n\n### Venue 1: Flat Fee\n- Flat fee: $2000\n- Additional cost per guest (for food): $50\n- Total cost for \\( n \\) guests: \\( 2000 + 50n \\)\n\n### Venue 2: Per Person Fee\n- Cost per guest (includes food): $250\n- Total cost for \\( n \\) guests: \\( 250n \\)\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n1. Set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   2000 + 50n = 250n\n   \\]\n\n2. Solve for \\( n \\).\n\nHere's the code using Python and Sympy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Declare the variable\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Set up the equations\nvenue1_cost = 2000 + 50 * n\nvenue2_cost = 250 * n\n\n# Set the costs equal to each other to find n\nequation = Eq(venue1_cost, venue2_cost)\n\n# Solve for n\nnumber_of_guests = solve(equation, n)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_guests)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. Let's verify by substituting the found number of guests back into both cost equations.\n2. Calculate the costs for venue 1 and venue 2 with the resolved number of guests.\n3. Ensure both costs are equal.\n\nGiven further calculations, if both costs are equal with the solved number of guests, our solution is verified.\n\nNow, let's present the final result:\n\nThe number of guests necessary for the costs of the two venues to be equal is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."

Let's verify the problem one more time to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Calculation\nLet's solve the equation \\(2000 + 50n = 250n\\) again and verify manually:\n\n1. Start by subtracting \\(50n\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 250n - 50n\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 200n\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\(n\\) by dividing both sides by 200:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{2000}{200} = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of guests necessary for the costs of the two venues to be equal is indeed \\(\\boxed{10}\\). The manual calculation confirms that the solution was initially correct."
