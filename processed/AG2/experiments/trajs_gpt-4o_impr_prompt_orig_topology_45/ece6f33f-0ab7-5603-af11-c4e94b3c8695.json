      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJenna shares her living space with four other people. The monthly cost for electricity in their shared home is $100. If they split the cost evenly, what would be the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill?"

      "content": "Let's tackle the problem using a direct Python solution. We want to calculate how much each of the five people pays annually if they split the monthly electricity cost evenly.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Calculate each person's monthly share of the electricity bill.\n2. Multiply this monthly share by 12 to determine the annual contribution per person.\n\nWe'll use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Total monthly electricity cost\nmonthly_cost = 100\n\n# Number of people sharing the cost\nnum_people = 5\n\n# Each person's monthly share\nmonthly_share_per_person = monthly_cost / num_people\n\n# Calculate the annual contribution per person\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_share_per_person * 12\n\n# Display the result\nprint(\"Annual contribution per person:\", annual_contribution_per_person)\n```\n\nNow, let's examine the output and ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Monthly cost per person:**\n   - Total monthly cost = $100\n   - Number of people = 5\n   - Monthly cost per person = \\( \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\)\n\n2. **Annual cost per person:**\n   - Monthly cost per person = $20\n   - Number of months in a year = 12\n   - Annual cost per person = \\( 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\)\n\nEverything checks out. Each person's annual contribution to the electricity bill is \\(\\boxed{240}\\) dollars."
