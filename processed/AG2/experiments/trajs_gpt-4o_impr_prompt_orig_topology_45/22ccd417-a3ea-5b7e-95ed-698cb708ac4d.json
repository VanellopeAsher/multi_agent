Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses. How many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi each time?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a mathematical approach to determine the amount of one type of medicine used in each dose. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Concept:**\nWe are given that the total amount of medicine per dose is the sum of a certain amount, \\( x \\), of one medicine and three times that amount of a second medicine. Hence, each dose is described by the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 3x = 4x \\]\n\nWe also know that there are 8 doses totaling 448 mL of medicine.\n\n**Case 1: Direct Python Solution**\n\nSince we know that 8 doses sum up to 448 mL, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 4x = 448 \\]\n\nFrom this, we can solve for \\( x \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose using the given formula \\( 4x \\).\n2. Express the total volume for all doses, and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's solve the equation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Declare the unknown\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total mL in one dose\ndose_volume = 4 * x\n\n# Equation for the total of 8 doses\ntotal_volume_eq = Eq(8 * dose_volume, 448)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(total_volume_eq, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"mL of one medicine combined each time: {solution[0]}\")\n```\n\nAfter running the code above, we solve the equation for \\( x \\).\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Verify the equation setup:\n   - 8 doses each containing \\( 4x \\) mL summing to 448 mL is correct: \\( 8 \\times 4x = 448 \\).\n2. Solve the equation: Simplifying gives \\( 32x = 448 \\).\n3. Solving further: \\( x = \\frac{448}{32} = 14 \\).\n\nHence, each time Saanvi combines 14 mL of one type of medicine.\n\n\\(\\boxed{14}\\)"
