Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked.

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we'll calculate the total amount Suzie spent on all the packs of gum by considering the cost of each type of gum she purchased. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Costs:**\n   - Cost of each pack of strawberry gum = $2\n   - Cost of grape gum = $2\n   - Cost of green apple gum = half of the grape gum = $2 / 2 = $1\n\n2. **Determine the Quantities:**\n   - Number of strawberry gum packs = 2\n   - Number of grape gum packs = 1 \n   - Number of green apple gum packs = 1\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   We will calculate the total cost using the cost and quantity of each type of gum.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate and print the total amount Suzie spent:\n\n```python\n# Costs for each type of gum\ncost_strawberry = 2  # cost per pack\ncost_grape = 2       # cost per pack\ncost_green_apple = cost_grape / 2  # half of the grape gum cost\n\n# Quantity of each type of gum\nquantity_strawberry = 2\nquantity_grape = 1\nquantity_green_apple = 1\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = (cost_strawberry * quantity_strawberry) + (cost_grape * quantity_grape) + (cost_green_apple * quantity_green_apple)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow we will execute the code to get the total amount Suzie paid:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\nLet's verify our calculations step by step:\n\n- Total cost for strawberry gum = 2 packs × $2/pack = $4\n- Total cost for grape gum = 1 pack × $2/pack = $2\n- Total cost for green apple gum = 1 pack × $1/pack = $1\n\nAdding these amounts together gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \\]\n\nThus, Suzie paid a total of $7.\n\n\\(\\boxed{7}\\)"
