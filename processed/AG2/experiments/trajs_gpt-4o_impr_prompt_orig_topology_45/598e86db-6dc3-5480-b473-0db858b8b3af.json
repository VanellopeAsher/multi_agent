Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

      "content": "### Key Idea:\nTo determine how many people Billy helps per hour, we first need to calculate the number of days he works and his daily helping rate. We will then deduce the number of people he helps per hour.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Days in the Period:**\n   - From March 1 to April 19.\n\n2. **Determine the Days Not Taken Off:**\n   - Billy takes 20% of the days off, leaving him with 80% of the days to work.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of People He Helps per Day:**\n   - Given he helps for 3 hours each working day, the problem boils down to finding how many people he helps per hour.\n\n4. **Solve for the People He Helps per Hour:**\n   - Given the total number of people he helps (240), solve for the required rate per hour.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Days\n- March has 31 days, and up to April 19 adds an additional 19 days.\n- Total days from March 1st to April 19th = 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Actual Working Days\n- Billy works on 80% of these days: \\( 0.8 \\times 50 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate How Many People He Helps per Hour\n- Given total people helped = 240 and he works 3 hours a day, determine the number of people he helps per hour.\n\n### Python Calculation\nUse the sympy library to compute:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Declare the variables\ntotal_days = 50\nworking_days = 0.8 * total_days\ntotal_people_helped = 240\nhours_per_day = 3\n\n# Let x be the people he helps per hour\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for total people helped\nequation = Eq(x * hours_per_day * working_days, total_people_helped)\n\n# Solve for x\npeople_per_hour = solve(equation, x)[0]\nprint(people_per_hour)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n1. Calculate the total number of working days: \\(0.8 \\times 50 = 40\\) working days.\n2. Total working hours: \\(40 \\times 3 = 120\\) hours.\n3. Verify that \\(120 \\times \\text{people per hour} = 240\\).\n\n**Result:**\n\n \\[\n \\boxed{2} \n\\]\n\nBilly helps 2 people per hour."
