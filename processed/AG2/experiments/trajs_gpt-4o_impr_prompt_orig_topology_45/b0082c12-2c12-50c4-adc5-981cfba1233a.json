Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLeah just got a new kitten. Spaying her cost $200, her 3 vaccines cost $20 each, but Leah got a 10% discount on the total vaccine cost, and the kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each. How much has the kitten cost so far?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost by considering all the components involved.\n\n### Key Ideas:\n\n1. **Total Cost Calculation**: \n   - Add the cost of spaying the kitten.\n   - Calculate the total cost of vaccines, including the 10% discount.\n   - Calculate the cost of broken vases.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using the outlined logic:\n\n1. **Spaying Cost**: $200\n\n2. **Vaccination Cost**:\n   - Cost per vaccine: $20\n   - Number of vaccines: 3\n   - Total cost before discount: \\(3 \\times 20\\)\n   - Discount: 10% off the total vaccine cost\n\n3. **Broken Vases**:\n   - Cost per vase: $12\n   - Number of vases broken: 4\n   - Total cost for broken vases: \\(4 \\times 12\\)\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python using the `sympy` library for accurate fractional calculations, and display the solution using fractions where applicable.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Costs\nspaying_cost = 200\nvaccine_cost_per_vaccine = 20\nnum_vaccines = 3\nvaccine_discount_percent = 10\nvase_cost_per_vase = 12\nnum_vases_broken = 4\n\n# Calculations\ntotal_vaccine_cost = vaccine_cost_per_vaccine * num_vaccines\nvaccine_discount = total_vaccine_cost * vaccine_discount_percent / 100\ntotal_vaccine_cost_with_discount = total_vaccine_cost - vaccine_discount\n\ntotal_vase_cost = vase_cost_per_vase * num_vases_broken\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = spaying_cost + total_vaccine_cost_with_discount + total_vase_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The total cost of the kitten so far is ${Rational(total_cost)}\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Spaying Cost**: Directly given as $200. No calculation needed.\n\n2. **Vaccination Cost**:\n   - Total cost without discount: \\(3 \\times 20 = 60\\)\n   - Discount: \\(60 \\times 0.10 = 6\\)\n   - Total cost with discount: \\(60 - 6 = 54\\)\n\n3. **Broken Vases**:\n   - Total cost for broken vases: \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\)\n\n4. **Total Cost**:\n   - Sum of all components: \\(200 + 54 + 48 = 302\\)\n\nFinal confirmed total cost is \\(302\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{302}\\)"

The breakdown of the costs is as follows: $200 for spaying, $54 for the vaccines after a 10% discount, and $48 for the broken vases. The sum of these amounts to $302.
