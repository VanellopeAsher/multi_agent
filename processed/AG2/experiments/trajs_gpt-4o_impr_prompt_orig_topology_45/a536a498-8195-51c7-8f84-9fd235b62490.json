Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

This means the audience size reported by Courtney included an extra 20% on top of the actual number of people.\n\nTo express this in mathematical terms, if the actual audience size was \\( x \\), then Courtney reported the audience size as:\n\n\\[\n1.2 \\times x = 48\n\\]\n\nGiven that Kelly said Courtney overstated by 20%, we need to equate this inflated report to 48 people. Now we can solve for \\( x \\) using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on Courtney's overstatement\nequation = Eq(1.2 * x, 48)\n\n# Solve the equation for the actual number of attendees, x\nactual_attendance = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(actual_attendance)\n```\n\nNow let's run this code to find out the actual attendance."

According to the problem statement, Kelly claims that 40 people actually attended, not an alternative solution.\n\nLet's reevaluate:\nCourtney's count was inflated by 20% and resulted in a count of 48 people. Hence, we should solve for the actual attendance \\( x \\) using the equation above:\n\nGiven:\n\\[ 1.2 \\times x = 48 \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation:\n\n1. Divide 48 by 1.2 to find the actual attendance.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code to find the actual number of attendees:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on Courtney's overstatement\nequation = Eq(1.2 * x, 48)\n\n# Solve the equation for the actual number of attendees, x\nactual_attendance = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Display the result\nprint(actual_attendance)\n```\n\nRunning this code should give us the actual attendance, which by logical reasoning, should be 40, as specified by Kelly. \n\nNow, let's verify our understanding and the solution. \n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nGiven Courtney's count with the overstatement factor of 1.2:\n\\[ \\text{Reported Audience} = 1.2 \\times \\text{Actual Audience} \\]\n\nGiven the reported audience is 48:\n\\[ \\Rightarrow 1.2 \\times \\text{Actual Audience} = 48 \\]\n\nSolving for the actual audience:\n\\[ \\text{Actual Audience} = \\frac{48}{1.2} = 40 \\]\n\nThis verification step aligns perfectly with Kelly's claim of actual attendance.\n\nThus, the calculation confirms that the actual audience was indeed \\(\\boxed{40}\\) people."
