Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 80 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fencing Sam and Harry each receive, given the total amount of 200 feet, with Harry receiving 80 feet more than Sam.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nWe can set up an equation to solve this distribution problem.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( x \\) as the amount of fencing Sam receives.\n- \\( x + 80 \\) as the amount of fencing Harry receives. (Because Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam)\n\nThe total amount of fencing given is 200 feet. Thus, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x + (x + 80) = 200 \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(x + (x + 80), 200)\n\n# Solve for x\nsam_fence = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result for Sam's fencing amount\nprint(\"Sam's share of the fence is:\", sam_fence, \"feet.\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n1. Set up the equation: \\( x + (x + 80) = 200 \\).\n2. Simplify: \n   \\[\n   2x + 80 = 200\n   \\]\n3. Subtract 80 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x = 120\n   \\]\n4. Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 60\n   \\]\n\nThus, Sam receives 60 feet of fencing.\n\nHarry receives \\( x + 80 = 60 + 80 = 140 \\) feet. The sum is \\( 60 + 140 = 200 \\), which matches the total 200 feet available.\n\nBased on this verification, Sam receives \\(\\boxed{60}\\) feet of fence."
