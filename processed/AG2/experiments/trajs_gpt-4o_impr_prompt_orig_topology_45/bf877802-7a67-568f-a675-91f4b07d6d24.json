Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total angle from the ground to the sun after the entire process described. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Starting Point**: The angle of elevation from the ground to the sun when it's at the tip of the pyramid is initially 32 degrees.\n\n2. **Movement in the First Phase**: \n   - The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours.\n   - The total change in angle during this phase is \\(5 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 50\\) degrees.\n\n3. **Total Angle After First Phase**: \n   - Initial angle: 32 degrees\n   - Change in angle (first phase): 50 degrees\n   - New angle after first phase: \\(32 + 50 = 82\\) degrees\n\n4. **Movement in the Second Phase**:\n   - After 10 hours, the sun moves at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours.\n   - The total change in angle during this phase is \\(3 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 6\\) degrees.\n\n5. **Total Angle After Second Phase**:\n   - Angle after first phase: 82 degrees\n   - Change in angle (second phase): 6 degrees\n   - Final angle after second phase: \\(82 + 6 = 88\\) degrees\n\nThus, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 88 degrees. \n\nLet's verify our final result using the structured approach:\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Verify Each Calculation**:\n   - We correctly calculated the additional angle due to the sun's movement in both phases.\n   - First phase: 50 degrees in 10 hours at 5 degrees/hour.\n   - Second phase: 6 degrees in 2 hours at 3 degrees/hour.\n  \n2. **Verify Total Angles**:\n   - Combined angle after both phases: \\(32 + 50 + 6 = 88\\) degrees.\n\n3. **Cross-Check Steps**:\n   - Initial angle is correctly added with changes from both phases.\n   - No logical errors in breaking down the problem or calculations.\n\nThe final answer is boxed as requested:\n\n\\(\\boxed{88}\\)"
