Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to interpret the provided information about John's running schedule.\n\nHere's what we know:\n- John runs a total of 60 miles a week.\n- He runs 3 days a week.\n- On one of these days, he runs a certain distance, say \\( x \\) miles.\n- On the other two days, he runs half as much, which means he runs \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) miles on each of those days.\n\nOur goal is to find out how much John runs on each day (\\( x \\)).\n\nLet's set up an equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n1. The total distance he runs in a week is given by:\n   \\[\n   x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} = x + x = 2x = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John runs 30 miles on one day and 15 miles (\\(\\frac{30}{2}\\)) on each of the other two days.\n\nNow let's verify our solution through implementation in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation representing the weekly running distance\nequation = Eq(x + x/2 + x/2, 60)\n\n# Solve the equation\ndistance = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"The distance John runs on one day is:\", distance[0])\nprint(\"On other days, he runs:\", distance[0]/2)\n```\n\nThis code will confirm the calculation. If the calculation matches our manual work, then we can box our final answer confidently.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n- We derived the equation correctly: \\( x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} = 60 \\).\n- Simplified to \\( 2x = 60 \\).\n- Solving, we found \\( x = 30 \\).\n\nTherefore, the solution stands correct.\n\n\\( \\boxed{30} \\)\n\nJohn runs 30 miles on one primary day, and 15 miles on each of the other two days he runs."
