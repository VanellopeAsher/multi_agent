      "content": "To solve this problem, we are asked to find out how many feet of crepe paper are required to hang along the perimeter of a rectangular fence. The presence of the tree in the middle of the yard doesn't impact the measurement of the fence's perimeter, as we won't be hanging streamers on it.\n\nLet's walk through the problem using the step-by-step process.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe backyard fence is a rectangle, and we need to calculate its perimeter. The dimensions of the rectangle are given: \n- Length = 20 feet\n- Width = 15 feet\n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Perimeter\nGiven the dimensions, calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence.\n\n```python\n# Step 2: Calculate the perimeter\nlength = 20\nwidth = 15\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\nprint(f\"The perimeter of the fence is {perimeter} feet.\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solution\nThe calculation from the code:\n\n```python\n# Step 3: Result\n# length, width = 20, 15\n# perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n# Shows the calculated perimeter\n```\n\nLet's go through the steps to verify our solution:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. Verify that we are using the correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \\( P = 2 \\times (L + W) \\).\n2. Substitute the given values correctly: \\( L = 20 \\) feet, \\( W = 15 \\) feet.\n3. Perform the calculation:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n4. Validation: The result, 70 feet, corresponds to the total length of crepe paper needed for the fence.\n\n### Final Answer\nSince all steps have been verified and no steps are missing, the required length of crepe paper is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{70}\n\\]"

Let's correct that and ensure the code is clear and functional.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code that calculates the perimeter of the fence:\n\n```python\n# Define the dimensions of the fence\nlength = 20\nwidth = 15\n\n# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The perimeter of the fence is {perimeter} feet.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1.
