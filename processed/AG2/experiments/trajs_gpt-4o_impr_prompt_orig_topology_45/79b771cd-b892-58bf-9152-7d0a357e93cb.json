Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the gold javelin when she is holding the gemstone. The fundamental concept here is about increasing the throwing distance of Polly using the gemstone.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Initial Throwing Distance without the Gemstone:**\n   - Polly can throw the javelin 4000 feet.\n\n2. **Throwing Distance with the Gemstone:**\n   - Polly's throwing distance is increased three times when holding the gemstone.\n   - Therefore, her new throwing distance is \\(3 \\times 4000\\) feet.\n\n3. **Dragon's Flame Reach:**\n   - The dragon can reach with its flames up to 10000 feet.\n\n4. **Calculation of Safe Distance:**\n   - We need to find out how far Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin when she is holding the gemstone. This is essentially the additional distance she can stand beyond the reach of the dragon's flames.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic computation\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the initial throwing distance\ninitial_distance = 4000\n\n# Define the multiplier for the gemstone effect\nmultiplier = 3\n\n# Calculate the new distance with gemstone\nnew_distance = initial_distance * multiplier\n\n# Define the dragon's flame reach\ndragon_flame_reach = 10000\n\n# Calculate the safe distance outside the range of the dragon's flames\nsafe_distance = new_distance - dragon_flame_reach\n\n# Output the result using the print function\nprint(safe_distance)\n```\n\n### Execution\n\n- Polly can throw the javelin 3 times farther while holding the gemstone: \n  \\[\n  3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n  \n- Calculate how far outside the dragon's reach she can stand:\n  \\[\n  12000 - 10000 = 2000 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Verify the distance calculation:\n  - Without gemstone: 4000 feet.\n  - With gemstone: \\(3 \\times 4000 = 12000\\) feet.\n  - Dragon's flames reach 10,000 feet.\n  - Therefore, Polly can stand \\(\\boxed{2000}\\) feet beyond the dragon's flame reach and still hit it with the javelin.\n\nThus, Polly can safely stand \\(\\boxed{2000}\\) feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames."

Subtracting the dragon's flame reach of 10,000 feet, she can safely stand 2000 feet outside the flame's reach and still hit the dragon.\n\nHence, the answer is \\(\\boxed{2000}\\)."
