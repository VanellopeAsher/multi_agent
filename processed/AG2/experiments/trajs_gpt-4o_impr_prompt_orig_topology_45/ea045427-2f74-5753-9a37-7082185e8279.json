Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each. William bought five notebooks and a ballpen. He also decided to buy a pencil case that costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens. How much did he spend in all?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total cost of the items purchased by William using Python. We will use sympy to help us with any necessary calculations, though this problem is simple enough to not require symbolic computation.\n\n**Problem-Solving Approach:**\n\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. We can calculate the total cost directly using basic arithmetic operations in Python.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Calculate the cost of five notebooks.\n2. Calculate the cost of one ballpen.\n3. Determine the cost of the pencil case, which is twice the cost of one notebook and two ballpens.\n4. Sum the costs to find the total amount spent by William.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Constants\nnotebook_price = Rational(3, 2)  # $1.50 each\nballpen_price = Rational(1, 2)   # $0.50 each\n\n# Calculations\ncost_of_notebooks = 5 * notebook_price\ncost_of_ballpen = 1 * ballpen_price\ncost_of_pencil_case = 2 * (notebook_price + 2 * ballpen_price)\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_of_notebooks + cost_of_ballpen + cost_of_pencil_case\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- We use `Rational` from `sympy` to keep fractions where necessary, instead of handling with decimal numbers.\n- Calculate the cost for five notebooks: \\(5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50\\).\n- Calculate the cost for one ballpen: \\(0.50 \\).\n- Calculate pencil case cost based on the problem statement which states it's twice the cost of one notebook plus two ballpens, i.e., \\(2 \\times (1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50)\\).\n- Finally, compute the total cost.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\nNow, let's verify the calculations:\n\n1. Cost of 5 notebooks: \\(5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50\\).\n2. Cost of 1 ballpen: \\(0.50\\).\n3. Cost of pencil case: \\(2 \\times (1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50) = 2 \\times (1.50 + 1.00) = 2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\\).\n4. Total cost: \\(7.50 + 0.50 + 5.00 = 13.00\\).\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the expected costs of each item and their total.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13.00}\n\\]"

For clarity, let's re-summarize the solution process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of Notebooks**: William bought 5 notebooks at $1.50 each.\n   - Total cost of notebooks = \\(5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost of One Ballpen**: Price is $0.50.\n   - Total cost of one ballpen = \\(0.50\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost of the Pencil Case**: The pencil case costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens.\n   - Price of one notebook and two ballpens = \\(1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50 = 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50\\).\n   - Pencil case cost = \\(2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Total Cost**: Sum up all costs.\n   - Total cost = \\(7.50 + 0.50 + 5.00 = 13.00\\).\n\nThus, the total amount William spent is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13.00}\n\\]\n\nThis is the final answer and matches our previous computations.
