Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. Each final is cut into 5 cm. How long is the ribbon?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out the original length of the ribbon given the conditions in the problem statement.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Dividing the ribbon into parts:**\n   - Marty cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts.\n   - Then, each of these 4 parts is divided into 5 equal parts.\n   \n2. **Understanding the final cut:**\n   - Each of these final parts is exactly 5 cm in length.\n\nLet's work this out in a formulaic way:\n\n- Suppose the original length of the ribbon is `L` cm.\n- Marty first divides it into 4 equal parts: Each part = \\( \\frac{L}{4} \\) cm.\n- Then, each of these parts is divided into 5 smaller parts: Each smaller part = \\( \\frac{L}{4 \\times 5} = \\frac{L}{20} \\) cm.\n- We know each final piece is 5 cm in length, so \\( \\frac{L}{20} = 5 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( L \\):**\n\nNow, solve the equation \\( \\frac{L}{20} = 5 \\) for \\( L \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Equation\nequation = Eq(L/20, 5)\n\n# Solve the equation\nlength_of_ribbon = solve(equation, L)[0]\nprint(length_of_ribbon)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- With the length of the ribbon calculated, verify that it satisfies all the conditions:\n  1. If you divide this length by 4 and then each of those parts by 5, you'll get 5 cm for each final smaller part.\n  \nBy following the above steps, we obtain the original length of the ribbon.\n\nLet's confirm our solution:\n\n```python\n# Verification of the solution\nlength_per_final_cut = length_of_ribbon / 20\nprint(length_per_final_cut == 5)\n```\n\nThe solution will print `True` if our calculations are correct.\n\nFinally, after performing the calculation, we find:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]\n\nThe original ribbon is 100 cm long."

The calculations confirm that the original length of the ribbon is indeed 100 cm. \n\nTo summarize:\n\n- The ribbon was initially divided into 4 parts, and then each part into 5 smaller parts, resulting in 20 smaller segments.\n- Each of these final segments is 5 cm long, leading to a total length of \\[ 5 \\times 20 = 100 \\] cm for the entire ribbon.\n\nThus, the original length of the ribbon is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) cm."
