Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 50 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps:\n\n1. **Determine the length of each of the 40 equal parts:**\n   - Marty starts with 10,000 millimeters of ribbon.\n   - He cuts this ribbon into 40 equal parts.\n   - So, the length of each part is the total length divided by 40.\n\n2. **Determine the length of each of the 50 equal parts:**\n   - Each of the 40 parts is further divided into 50 smaller equal parts.\n   - So, the length of each final cut is the length of one of the 40 parts divided by 50.\n\nLet's compute this using Python and the `sympy` library for accurate fractional representation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total length of ribbon in millimeters\ntotal_ribbon_mm = 10000\n\n# Number of cuts for the first division\nfirst_division_parts = 40\n\n# Length of each part after the first division\nlength_first_division = Rational(total_ribbon_mm, first_division_parts)\n\n# Number of cuts for the second division\nsecond_division_parts = 50\n\n# Length of each final part\nfinal_length = length_first_division / second_division_parts\n\n# Print the final length in fractional form\nprint(final_length)\n```\n\nNow let's go through the verification steps:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate the length of each of the 40 parts:**\n   - Total length = 10,000 mm.\n   - Divide by 40:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10000}{40} = 250 \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the length of each of the 50 smaller parts:**\n   - Each initial part is 250 mm.\n   - Dividing 250 mm by 50 gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n\nThus, each final cut will be 5 mm in length.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
