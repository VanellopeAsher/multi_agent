Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten. If the mean score is 70, what's the forgortten score?"

      "content": "To find the forgotten score, we'll use the mathematical concept of the mean (average). \n\nThe mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. In this problem, the mean of Sally's scores is known, and we will use it to find the missing score.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Count the Scores**: \n   Sally has 8 given scores and 1 missing score, making a total of 9 scores.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of Known Scores**:\n   Sum the scores she has: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, and 70.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation for Mean**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the forgotten score.\n   - Using the formula for the mean:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + x}{9} = 70\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the Forgotten Score \\( x \\)**:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Given scores\nscores = [50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70]\n\n# Known values\nmean_score = 70\ntotal_scores = len(scores) + 1  # Including the forgotten score\n\n# Calculate the sum of known scores\nsum_of_scores = sum(scores)\n\n# Define the forgotten score as a symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation for the mean\nequation = Eq((sum_of_scores + x) / total_scores, mean_score)\n\n# Solve for the forgotten score x\nforgotten_score = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the forgotten score\nprint(forgotten_score[0])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We solve for \\( x \\) by equating the sum of scores including \\( x \\) over the total count to the mean. \n- Sympy's `solve` function is then used to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n\n- The sum of known scores: \\( 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570 \\).\n- Using the mean formula \\( \\frac{570 + x}{9} = 70 \\).\n\nSolving the equation:\n\n\\[\n570 + x = 70 \\times 9 = 630\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 630 - 570 = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, the forgotten score is \\(\\boxed{60}\\)."
