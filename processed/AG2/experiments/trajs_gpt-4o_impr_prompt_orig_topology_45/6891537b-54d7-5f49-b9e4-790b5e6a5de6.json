Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Miss Maria initially has, and then calculate how many students she can give 10 cards each to, after she keeps 50 cards for herself.\n\nLet's break this down into steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, with each deck containing 25 cards.\n   - She also has five boxes of baseball cards, with each box containing 40 cards.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Cards After Miss Maria Keeps Some:**\n   - Miss Maria decided to keep 50 cards for herself.\n\n3. **Find Out the Number of Students:**\n   - Miss Maria gave each student 10 cards.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic operations (not necessary here, but required by the problem statement)\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\n\n# Step 2: Subtract the cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_after_keeping = total_cards - 50\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of students who received cards\ncards_per_student = 10\nnumber_of_students = cards_after_keeping // cards_per_student\n\n# Output the result\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Initial Card Calculation:**\n   - Basketball: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\)\n   - Baseball: \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\)\n   - Total: \\(150 + 200 = 350\\)\n\n2. **After Keeping 50 Cards:**\n   - Cards to give away: \\(350 - 50 = 300\\)\n\n3. **Distribute 10 Cards Per Student:**\n   - Number of students: \\(300 \\div 10 = 30\\)\n\nDouble-checking the math confirms these calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{30}\\)"
