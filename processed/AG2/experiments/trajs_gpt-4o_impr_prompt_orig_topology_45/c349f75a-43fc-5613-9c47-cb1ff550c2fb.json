      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

      "content": "Let's solve the problem using the given information.\n\n**Key Idea**: To find the total age of all siblings, we need to determine the age of each sibling and then sum them up.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify known ages:**\n   - Each sister is 16 years old.\n   - One younger brother is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.\n\n2. **Determine the older brother's age:**\n   - According to the problem, the older brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother.\n   - Therefore, the older brother's age = \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total age:**\n   - There are 10 sisters, each 16 years old.\n   - Total age of sisters = \\(10 \\times 16 = 160\\).\n   - Age of the younger brother = 12.\n   - Age of the older brother = 24.\n   - Total age of all siblings = 160 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother).\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate using the described formulas and procedure\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of sisters and their individual age\nnum_sisters = 10\nage_sister = 16\n\n# Younger brother's age\nage_younger_brother = 12\n\n# Older brother's age is double the younger brother's age\nage_older_brother = 2 * age_younger_brother\n\n# Total age calculation\ntotal_age = (num_sisters * age_sister) + age_younger_brother + age_older_brother\n\n# Print the total age in a fractional format, although it is an integer\nprint(Rational(total_age))\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Sisters' total age**: \\(10 \\times 16 = 160\\).\n2. **Younger brother's age**: 12.\n3. **Older brother's age**: \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n4. **Total age check**: \\(160 + 12 + 24 = 196\\).\n\nThe calculations are consistent with the problem statement and the logical steps.\n\nFinally, the total age of all siblings is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{196}\n\\]"
