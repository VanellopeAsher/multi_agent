      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "To determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday and how it compares to the number she wrote on Tuesday, we need to use the information provided and create an equation to solve the problem.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of articles written on Tuesday.\n   - From the problem statement, on Monday she wrote 5 articles.\n   - On Tuesday, she wrote \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more articles than on Monday. Hence, \\( x = 5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Time Spent:**\n   - The problem states that Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over three days, with each article taking an average of 4 hours.\n   - Therefore, the total number of articles written in these three days is \\( \\frac{104}{4} = 26 \\).\n\n3. **Equations Based on the Articles:**\n   - Articles on Monday: 5\n   - Articles on Tuesday: 7\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the number of articles written on Wednesday.\n   - Thus, the total number of articles is: \n     \\[\n     5 + 7 + w = 26\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( w \\):**\n   \\[\n   w = 26 - (5 + 7) = 26 - 12 = 14\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Relationship Between Articles Written on Wednesday and Tuesday:**\n   - From our calculations, on Tuesday she wrote 7 articles and on Wednesday she wrote 14 articles.\n   - Therefore, the number of times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as on Tuesday is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{14}{7} = 2\n     \\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet's verify by checking the total number of articles:\n- Monday: 5 articles\n- Tuesday: 7 articles\n- Wednesday: 14 articles\n- Total = \\( 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \\), which matches the given total number of articles.\n\nHaving verified all calculations, I am confident that the answer is correct.\n\nThe final result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
