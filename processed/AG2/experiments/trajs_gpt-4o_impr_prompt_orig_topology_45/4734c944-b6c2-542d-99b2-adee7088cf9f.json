Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2.5 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how Peter is allocating his money on a daily basis over the course of a week, given the constraints on his spending for different parts of the week. We will then calculate the total number of action figures he can purchase within these constraints.\n\nKey Idea:\nPeter has $70 to spend equally over 7 days. This means he spends \\(\\frac{70}{7} = 10\\) dollars each day.\n\nStep-by-Step Process:\n1. Calculate the number of action figures Peter can buy each day from Sunday through Wednesday when each wooden action figure costs $5.\n2. Calculate the number of action figures Peter can buy each day from Thursday through Saturday when each plastic action figure costs $2.5.\n3. Sum up the total number of action figures purchased throughout the week.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the `sympy` library for precise calculations in fractions, where necessary.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total money and daily spend\ntotal_money = 70\ndays_in_week = 7\ndaily_spend = Rational(total_money, days_in_week)\n\n# Cost per action figure\nwooden_cost = 5\nplastic_cost = Rational(5, 2)  # 2.5 as a fraction is 5/2\n\n# Calculate the number of action figures\nwooden_days = 4  # Sunday to Wednesday\nplastic_days = 3  # Thursday to Saturday\n\n# Calculate number of wooden and plastic figures\nwooden_figures_per_day = daily_spend // wooden_cost\nplastic_figures_per_day = daily_spend // plastic_cost\n\ntotal_wooden_figures = wooden_figures_per_day * wooden_days\ntotal_plastic_figures = plastic_figures_per_day * plastic_days\n\n# Total action figures\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(total_action_figures)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Daily spend is correctly calculated as \\(\\frac{70}{7} = 10\\).\n2. For wooden action figures costing $5, Peter buys \\(\\frac{10}{5} = 2\\) figures per day from Sunday to Wednesday.\n3. For plastic action figures costing $2.5, which is \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\), Peter buys \\(\\frac{10}{2.5} = \\frac{10 \\times 2}{5} = 4\\) figures per day from Thursday to Saturday.\n4. Total number of figures: \\((2 \\text{ figures/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days}) + (4 \\text{ figures/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days}) = 8 + 12 = 20\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{20}\\)"
