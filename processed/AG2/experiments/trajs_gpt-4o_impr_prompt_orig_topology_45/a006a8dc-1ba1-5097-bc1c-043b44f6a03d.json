Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first identify the key details provided:\n\n- There are a total of 20 kids, equally divided into girls and boys.\n- Each boy brought back 60 shells.\n- The girls collectively brought back shells equal to the amount the boys brought, plus an additional 4.5 times that amount.\n\nGiven that the total number of kids is 20, and they are equally divided into boys and girls, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. Here's how we will solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of shells brought by the boys.\n2. Use this total to determine how many seashells each girl brought back.\n\nWe can implement this using Python and SymPy for clear symbolic representation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Number of boys and girls\nnum_boys = 10\nnum_girls = 10\n\n# Shells brought back by each boy\nshells_per_boy = 60\n\n# Total shells brought back by boys\ntotal_shells_boys = num_boys * shells_per_boy\n\n# Let x be the number of shells brought back by each girl\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# The equation for the total shells brought by girls\n# Girls' total = Boys' total + 4.5 * Boys' total\ngirls_total_shells = total_shells_boys + Rational(9, 2) * total_shells_boys\n\n# Total shells brought by all girls = 10 * x\neq = Eq(num_girls * x, girls_total_shells)\n\n# Solve the equation\nshells_per_girl = solve(eq, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We set up the equation for the total number of shells collected by the girls as \\( 10x \\).\n- The girls collected a total equal to what the boys collected plus 4.5 times that amount, hence the right side of the equation is set to \\( \\text{{total\\_shells\\_boys}} \\times (1 + 4.5) \\).\n- We solve for \\( x \\), which represents the number of shells each girl collected.\n\nRunning this code provides the solution.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Calculate shells per boy**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total shells by boys} = 10 \\times 60 = 600 \n   \\]\n2. **Calculate shells by girls**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Girls' shells} = 600 + 4.5 \\times 600 = 600 + 2700 = 3300\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10x = 3300 \n   \\Rightarrow x = 330 \n   \\]\n\nThe results match the calculations, confirming the correctness of our approach. \n\n\\(\\boxed{330}\\) is the number of seashells brought by each girl."
