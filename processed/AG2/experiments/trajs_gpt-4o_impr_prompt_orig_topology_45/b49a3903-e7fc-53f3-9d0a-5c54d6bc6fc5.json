Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step and determine how many total rows of flowers Jackson will plant.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe need to calculate how many rows of each tulip type Jackson can plant based on the number of tulips he buys and the row capacity for each color. Additionally, we account for the rows of yellow tulips added between the rows of red and blue tulips.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Calculate Rows for Red Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 6 red tulips per row.\n   - He buys 36 red tulips.\n   - Calculate the number of rows for red tulips: \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Rows for Blue Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips per row.\n   - He buys 24 blue tulips.\n   - Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips: \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Rows of Yellow Tulips:**\n   - Jackson can fit 5 yellow tulips per row.\n   - He buys 30 yellow tulips.\n   - Calculate the number of rows for yellow tulips: \\( \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Total Rows Calculation:**\n   - Assuming Jackson places a row of yellow tulips between each row of red and blue tulips and after them:\n     - We have 6 rows of red tulips, 3 rows of blue tulips, and 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n     - Since every row of red and blue is followed by a row of yellow tulips, we need to add a yellow row after each red and blue sequence.\n\n5. **Organizing Rows:**\n   - Red rows: 6\n   - Yellow between red and blue: 6 (after each row of red and after the last red)\n   - Blue rows: 3\n   - Yellow between blue: 0 (because all yellow rows are already assigned)\n   \n   However, the constraint on the yellow tulips changes the understanding:\n   - After each complete cycle (red -> yellow -> blue -> yellow), minus one yellow as one yellow will always conclude a cycle:\n     - Red 6\n     - Yellow 6\n     - Blue 3 \n   - Where should the 30 yellow limit be assigned given extra yellows don't interrupt but bridge? Logic indicates all yellows are serving.\n   - With \\(\\frac{36+24}{6}=10\\) rows total upon reevaluation due a missing link. Yellow doesn't influence a total bridge span at the max possibility without institutional draw-in.\n\nFinally, let's ensure we've accounted for the correct number of yellow rows given the numbers properly serve placement semblance only.\n\n### Final Verification:\n1. Red: 6\n2. Blue: 3 (\\(3+3\\))\n3. Yellow: 6\n\nHowever, we reconsider due to previous error,\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\] \nrows take precedence actually fitting total sequence, was solely by standard flow appearance rather than breaking requirement.\n\nHence, the actual realignment is unnecessary given prior error results for continuity capture."
