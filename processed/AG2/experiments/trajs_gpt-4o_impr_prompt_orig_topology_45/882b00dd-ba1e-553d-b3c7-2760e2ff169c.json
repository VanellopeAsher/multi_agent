Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the hourly wages of both Billy and Sally at the one-year mark and calculate their earnings for working 20 hours. Let's go through the steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Determine Billy's Hourly Rate After One Year:**\n   - Starting rate: $10.00/hour.\n   - After 2 months: Raise of $0.50/hour → $10.50/hour.\n   - On his first anniversary (1 year): Raise of $1.00/hour → $11.50/hour.\n\n2. **Determine Sally's Hourly Rate After One Year:**\n   - Starting rate: $10.00/hour + $0.50 = $10.50/hour.\n   - After 2 months: Raise of $0.50/hour → $11.00/hour.\n   - Note: We do not have a one-year anniversary raise for Sally since we're calculating at two months past her start.\n\n3. **Calculate Earnings for 20 Hours:**\n   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours at his anniversary rate: \\( 20 \\times 11.50 \\).\n   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours at two months in: \\( 20 \\times 11.00 \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Difference:**\n   - Calculate how much more Billy earns than Sally for 20 hours.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Billy's earnings after 1 year\nbilly_hourly_rate = 11.50  # Billy's rate after raises\nbilly_earnings = 20 * billy_hourly_rate\n\n# Calculate Sally's earnings after 2 months\nsally_hourly_rate = 11.00  # Sally's rate after her raise\nsally_earnings = 20 * sally_hourly_rate\n\n# Difference in earnings\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Output the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- **Billy's Hourly Rate:** $11.50 as verified by applying each raise correctly.\n- **Sally's Hourly Rate:** $11.00 after applying starting and 2-month raises.\n- Calculation: Confirmed both of their 20-hour earnings and the difference.\n\nAfter verifying each step, \\(\\text{Billy earns } \\$10 \\text{ more than Sally for 20 hours of work.}\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."

Let's reiterate the process and confirm the calculations once more to ensure clarity and correctness.\n\n### Problem Recap and Solution\n\n**1.

Sally's Pay:**\n- Starting rate: \\(10.00 + 0.50 = 10.50\\).\n- After 2 months: \\(10.50 + 0.50 = 11.00\\).\n\n**Earnings calculation for 20 hours:**\n\n- **Billy's Total Earnings:** \n  \\[\n  20 \\times 11.50 = 230.00 \n  \\]\n\n- **Sally's Total Earnings:** \n  \\[\n  20 \\times 11.00 = 220.00\n  \\]\n\n**Difference:** \n\\[\n230.00 - 220.00 = 10.00\n\\]\n\nThus, Billy earns \\$10 more than Sally after they both work for 20 hours.\n\nSo, the final boxed answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"
