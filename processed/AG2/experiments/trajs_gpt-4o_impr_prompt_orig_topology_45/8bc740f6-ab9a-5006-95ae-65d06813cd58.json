Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Calculate the total number of articles the two websites published together in February if there are 2.8 times of ten days in the month."

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites together over the course of February. We are given that there are 2.8 times of ten days in the month of February. In regular terms, this indicates a month with 28 days, which is consistent with February. Let's calculate the total number of articles:\n\n**Key Concept**: Use multiplication to determine the total number of articles based on the daily averages.\n\n**Approach**: Direct Python Solution\n\n1. Calculate the number of articles published daily by both websites combined.\n2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days (28 days for February).\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Libraries\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Average articles per day\npolitical_weather_daily = 20\nbusiness_daily = 10\n\n# Total articles per day\ntotal_daily = political_weather_daily + business_daily\n\n# Total days in February\ndays_in_february = 28  # because 2.8 times of ten days equals 28 days\n\n# Total articles in February\ntotal_articles_february = total_daily * days_in_february\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_articles_february)\n```\n\nNow we'll verify this calculation step by step.\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\n1. **Daily Total**: \\(20 + 10 = 30\\) articles/day\n2. **Total Days in February**: 28 days (since \\(2.8 \\times 10 = 28\\))\n3. **Total Articles**: \\(30 \\times 28 = 840\\) articles\n\nAll steps are verified. Thus, the total number of articles published in February by both websites is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{840}\n\\]"
