Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use a direct Python solution involving simple algebra to find the son's age.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- Let \\( s \\) be the son's age.\n\nAccording to the problem:\nCarver's age is 60, and this is 8 years less than twice his son's age.\n\nThis can be written as:\n\\[ 60 = 2s - 8 \\]\n\nOur task is to solve this equation for \\( s \\).\n\nHere's the Python code to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the son's age\ns = symbols('s')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(60, 2*s - 8)\n\n# Solve the equation\nson_age = solve(equation, s)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(son_age)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. State the equation derived from the problem: Carver's age (60) is 8 years less than twice the son's age.\n   \\[ 60 = 2s - 8 \\]\n\n2. Solve for \\( s \\):\n   \\[ 60 + 8 = 2s \\]\n   \\[ 68 = 2s \\]\n   \\[ s = \\frac{68}{2} \\]\n   \\[ s = 34 \\]\n\nThus, the son's age is indeed 34 years old. The calculations align with the provided Python code solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\(\\boxed{34}\\)"
