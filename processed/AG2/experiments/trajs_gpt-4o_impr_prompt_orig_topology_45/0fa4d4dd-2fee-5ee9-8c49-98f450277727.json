      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

      "content": "To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Key Idea\nWe need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to purchase and then figure out how much additional money she needs beyond her current savings and earnings. We'll then determine how many times she must mow the lawn to meet this requirement.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Calculate Total Cost**: \n   - The jacket costs $120.\n   - Each pair of shoes costs $100, and she wants 2 pairs: \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\).\n   - Total cost for the jacket and shoes is \\(120 + 200 = 320\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Earnings from Babysitting**:\n   - Sara babysits 10 times, earning $5 each time: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Calculate Initial Savings**:\n   - Sara already had $100 saved.\n\n4. **Determine Total Money Sara Currently Has**:\n   - Add initial savings and babysitting earnings: \\(100 + 50 = 150\\).\n\n5. **Calculate Additional Money Needed**:\n   - Subtract the total money Sara currently has from the total cost: \\(320 - 150 = 170\\).\n\n6. **Determine How Many Times She Must Mow the Lawn**:\n   - Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $10.\n   - To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn an additional $170:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of mows needed} = \\lceil \\frac{170}{10} \\rceil = 17\n   \\]\n\n### Python Solution\nLet's compute this using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom math import ceil\n\n# Calculate costs\ntotal_cost = 120 + 2 * 100  # jacket and two pairs of shoes\nearnings_babysitting = 10 * 5  # earnings from babysitting\ninitial_savings = 100\n\n# Total money already available\ntotal_money_current = initial_savings + earnings_babysitting\n\n# Additional money needed\nadditional_needed = total_cost - total_money_current\n\n# Calculate number of times to mow the lawn\ntimes_to_mow_lawn = ceil(additional_needed / 10)\n\nprint(times_to_mow_lawn)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Cost Calculation**: Jacket ($120) + 2 Shoes ($200) = Total Cost ($320)\n2. **Current Funds**:\n   - Initial savings: $100\n   - Babysitting earnings: $50\n   - Total current funds: $150\n3. **Additional Needed**: $320 - $150 = $170\n4. **Mowing Calculations**: \n   - $170 needed, earning $10 per mow results in \\(\\lceil \\frac{170}{10} \\rceil = 17\\) mows.\n\nThe calculations have been verified step by step and are consistent with our expected results.\n\nTherefore, the number of times Sara must mow the lawn is \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."

Here's a recap of the calculation:\n\n1. **Total Cost**: Jacket ($120) + 2 pairs of shoes ($200) = $320\n2. **Current Savings and Earnings**:\n   - Initial savings: $100\n   - Babysitting earnings: $50 (from babysitting 10 times at $5 each)\n   - Total funds: $150\n3. **Additional Funds Needed**: Total cost ($320) - Total funds ($150) = $170\n4. **Mowing Earnings Calculation**:\n   - Earn $10 per mowing\n   - Total mowings needed = \\(\\lceil \\frac{170}{10} \\rceil = 17\\)\n\nThe solution found that Sara needs to mow the lawn 17 times. This calculation confirms the steps and result accurately. Thus, Sara must mow the lawn \\(\\boxed{17}\\) times."
