Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 0.1 times of one thousand years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 0.1 times of one hundred years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age."

      "content": "To solve this age-related problem, let's break it down step by step. We are given a few relationships involving the ages of Peter, Paul, and John, and we need to find Peter's age.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( P \\) be the age of Peter.\n   - Let \\( A \\) be the age of Paul.\n   - Let \\( J \\) be the age of John.\n\n2. **Relate Ages Using Given Information:**\n   - The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean (John) is 0.1 times one thousand years. This translates to:\n     \\[\n     P + A + J = 0.1 \\times 1000 = 100\n     \\]\n   - Paul’s age is 0.1 times one hundred years older than John:\n     \\[\n     A = 0.1 \\times 100 + J = 10 + J\n     \\]\n   - Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:\n     \\[\n     P = A + J\n     \\]\n\n3. **Formulate Equations:**\n   - Substitute \\( A = 10 + J \\) in the equation for \\( P \\):\n     \\[\n     P = (10 + J) + J = 10 + 2J\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( A = 10 + J \\) and the expression for \\( P \\) in the total age equation:**\n   \\[\n   (10 + 2J) + (10 + J) + J = 100\n   \\]\n   Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   20 + 4J = 100\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( J \\):\n   \\[\n   4J = 80 \\\\\n   J = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find Ages using \\( J \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( J = 20 \\) to find \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     A = 10 + J = 10 + 20 = 30\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( J = 20 \\) to find \\( P \\):\n     \\[\n     P = 10 + 2 \\times 20 = 10 + 40 = 50\n     \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- Check the total sum of ages: \\( P + A + J = 50 + 30 + 20 = 100 \\), which is correct.\n- Verify relation \\( A = 10 + J = 30 \\).\n- Verify relation \\( P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50 \\).\n\nAll equations and checks are satisfied. Thus, the age of Peter is correctly calculated.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]"
