      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it. They are red, white, purple, and yellow.   Half the mural is yellow. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, calculate how many pints of red paint was used."

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, given the distribution of colors.\n\n### Key Idea:\n1. **Understand the distribution**: We know that half of the total paint used is yellow, and the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.\n2. **Express quantities mathematically**: \n   - Total paint = 12 pints\n   - Yellow paint = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Total\\_paint} \\)\n   - The remaining paint is equally distributed among red, white, and purple.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of yellow paint**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yellow\\_paint} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the amount of paint for the other colors**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining paint for red, white, and purple} = 12 - 6 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equally distribute the remaining paint among red, white, and purple**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Each of red, white, purple} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n### Calculate Red Paint:\n\n- **Red paint = 2 pints**\n\nLet's write the calculation in Python to confirm:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total paint used\ntotal_paint = 12\n\n# Calculate yellow paint\nyellow_paint = Rational(1, 2) * total_paint\n\n# Remaining paint for red, white, and purple\nremaining_paint = total_paint - yellow_paint\n\n# Equal amount of red, white, and purple\neach_color_paint = remaining_paint / 3\n\n# Printing the amount of red paint\nprint(f\"Amount of red paint used: {each_color_paint}\")\n```\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Yellow paint**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\) pints\n2. **Remaining paint**: \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\) pints\n3. **Each color (red, white, purple)**: \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints\n4. **Total verification**: \\( 6 \\text{ (yellow) + } 2 \\times 3 \\text{ (remaining colors) } \\) equals the total 12 pints.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the amount of red paint used is:\n\\[\\boxed{2}\\]"
