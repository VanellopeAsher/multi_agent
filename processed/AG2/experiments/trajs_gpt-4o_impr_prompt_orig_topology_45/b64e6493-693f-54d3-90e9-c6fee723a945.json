Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nColby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 80 quarters, 60 dimes, 140 nickels, and 150 pennies, how many can he buy?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gumballs Colby can purchase given the amount of money he has in various denominations. Here's how we can tackle it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Amount in Each Coin Type:**\n   - **Quarters:** 80 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, or 5 nickels.\n   - **Dimes:** 60 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10, or 2 nickels.\n   - **Nickels:** 140 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05.\n   - **Pennies:** 150 pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01. For convenience, we'll express this in nickels as well since gumballs cost a nickel each (5 pennies per nickel).\n\n2. **Convert All Amounts to Nickels:**\n   - Each quarter is equivalent to 5 nickels.\n   - Each dime is equivalent to 2 nickels.\n   - Pennies need to be divided by 5 to convert into nickels.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Number of Nickels:**\n   - Multiply the number of each coin type by its equivalent in nickels and sum them all up.\n\n4. **Determine Total Gumballs Colby Can Buy:**\n   - Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, the total number of gumballs equals the total number of nickels.\n\n### Let's Implement the Solution Using Python:\n\n```python\n# Let's calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy\n\n# Number of each type of coin\nquarters = 80\ndimes = 60\nnickels = 140\npennies = 150\n\n# Convert everything to nickels\ntotal_nickels_from_quarters = quarters * 5  # 1 quarter = 5 nickels\ntotal_nickels_from_dimes = dimes * 2       # 1 dime = 2 nickels\ntotal_nickels_from_nickels = nickels       # Nickels are already in nickels\ntotal_nickels_from_pennies = pennies // 5  # 5 pennies = 1 nickel\n\n# Total nickels\ntotal_nickels = (total_nickels_from_quarters + \n                 total_nickels_from_dimes + \n                 total_nickels_from_nickels + \n                 total_nickels_from_pennies)\n\n# The number of gumballs Colby can purchase is equal to the total nickels\ngumballs = total_nickels\n\n# Output the result\nprint(gumballs)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Calculation of Nickels:**\n   - Quarters: \\(80 \\times 5 = 400\\) nickels\n   - Dimes: \\(60 \\times 2 = 120\\) nickels\n   - Nickels: 140 nickels\n   - Pennies: \\(150 \\div 5 = 30\\) nickels\n\n2. **Total Nickels Calculation:**\n   - \\(400 + 120 + 140 + 30 = 690\\) nickels\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Colby can buy 690 gumballs.\n\nGiven our verification steps are thorough and correct, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{690}\n\\]"

He possesses:\n- 80 quarters\n- 60 dimes\n- 140 nickels\n- 150 pennies\n\n### Objective:\nDetermine how many gumballs he can buy with his coins.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Convert All Coins to Nickels:**\n   - **Quarters:** Each quarter is worth 5 nickels. For 80 quarters:\n     \\[\n     80 \\times 5 = 400 \\text{ nickels}\n     \\]\n   - **Dimes:** Each dime is worth 2 nickels. For 60 dimes:\n     \\[\n     60 \\times 2 = 120 \\text{ nickels}\n     \\]\n   - **Nickels:** Already in nickels, so he has 140 nickels.\n   - **Pennies:** Each nickel is worth 5 pennies. For 150 pennies:\n     \\[\n     150 \\div 5 = 30 \\text{ nickels}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Nickels:**\n   Sum the number of nickels from all the coins:\n   \\[\n   400 + 120 + 140 + 30 = 690 \\text{ nickels}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of Gumballs:**\n   Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, the total number of gumballs Colby can buy is equal to the total number of nickels:\n   \\[\n   690 \\text{ gumballs}\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{690}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that Colby can purchase 690 gumballs with his available change.
