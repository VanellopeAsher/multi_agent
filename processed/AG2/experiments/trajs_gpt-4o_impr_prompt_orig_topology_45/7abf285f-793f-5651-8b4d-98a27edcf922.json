      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

      "content": "To find out how much Jessica will pay on her debts in a year when paying 50% more than the minimum, we need to determine her monthly debt payment and then multiply it by 12 months. Let's solve this problem step by step using Python.\n\n1. **Identify the minimum monthly payments for each debt:**\n   - Student loans: $300\n   - Credit card: $200\n   - Mortgage: $500\n\n2. **Calculate the total minimum payment:**\n   - Total minimum monthly payment = $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage)\n\n3. **Calculate the 50% additional payment over the minimum:**\n   - 50% more than the minimum = 1.5 times the total minimum monthly payment\n\n4. **Calculate the annual payment, based on the new monthly payment:**\n   - Annual payment = 12 times the new monthly payment\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to calculate the amount:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Minimum monthly payments\nstudent_loans = 300\ncredit_card = 200\nmortgage = 500\n\n# Calculate total minimum monthly payment\ntotal_minimum = student_loans + credit_card + mortgage\n\n# Calculate the monthly payment with 50% more\nmonthly_payment_with_50_percent_more = Rational(3, 2) * total_minimum\n\n# Calculate the annual payment\nannual_payment = 12 * monthly_payment_with_50_percent_more\n\n# Display the result, using fractions\nprint(f\"Jessica pays on her debts in a year: {annual_payment} dollars\")\n\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n1. **Total minimum monthly payment calculation:**\n   \\[\n   300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Monthly payment with a 50% increase:**\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\times 1000 = 1500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Annual payment calculation:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 1500 = 18000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThe verification confirms the calculations match the expected results. Jessica will pay \\(\\boxed{18000}\\) dollars on her debts in a year."
