Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's start by breaking down the information given:\n\n- There are 6 students playing tennis.\n- There are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis.\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of students playing volleyball} = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n  \\]\n\n- There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. We denote the number of boys playing soccer as \\( b \\).\n\nWe need to find the total number of students based on the respective groups. The total number of students is the sum of students in all groups:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total number of students} = (\\text{Number of tennis players}) + (\\text{Number of volleyball players}) + (\\text{Number of soccer players})\n\\]\n\nUsing the given data, express this as:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total number of students} = 6 + 12 + (b + 22)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying yields:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total number of students} = 18 + b + 22\n\\]\n\nCombine the constant terms:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total number of students} = 40 + b\n\\]\n\nSince we don't have specific information about the number of boys (\\( b \\)), we can't determine an exact numerical answer for the total number of students without knowing \\( b \\).\n\nThus, the final result depends on the value of \\( b \\), and is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \n\\boxed{40 + b}\n\\]\n\n### VERIFICATION\nLet's verify each step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of volleyball players: \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) students. Check.\n2. Total number of students = Tennis players + Volleyball players + Soccer players. Check the expression: \\( 6 + 12 + 22 + b = 40 + b \\).\n3. The calculation appears correct given the information.\n\nThe final expression verified is \\( \\boxed{40 + b} \\)."
