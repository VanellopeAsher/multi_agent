Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow a step-by-step process using Case 3: Step-by-Step Process. We will break down the problem to determine how much Walter's friend gave him. Let's begin:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Donations Before Lawyer's Contribution\nWalter collects money from his neighbors and from an online fund. The total amount before his lawyer's contribution is:\n\\[ 500 \\, (\\text{from neighbors}) + 1500 \\, (\\text{from online fund}) = 2000 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Lawyer's Total Contribution\nThe problem states that Walter's lawyer donates three times as much as everyone else donates. However, we need to determine how much everyone else, including Walter's friend, donates.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Total Donations Excluding Lawyer's Contribution\nLet's denote the amount donated by Walter's friend as \\( x \\).\n\nThe total contributions excluding the lawyer are:\n\\[ 2000 + x \\]\n\nThe lawyer contributes three times this total:\n\\[ 3 \\times (2000 + x) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Set Up the Equation with Lawyer's Contribution\nWe know the lawyer contributed $6600 in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 3 \\times (2000 + x) = 6600 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Equation\nLet's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(3 * (2000 + x), 6600)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\n### Execute and Verify\nNow, let's execute and verify the solution. Based on the equation:\n\\[ 3 \\times (2000 + x) = 6600 \\]\n\\[ 3 \\times 2000 + 3x = 6600 \\]\n\\[ 6000 + 3x = 6600 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 6600 - 6000 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 600 \\]\n\\[ x = 200 \\]\n\n### Verification\n1. Total donation excluding the lawyer: \\( 2000 + 200 = 2200 \\).\n2. Lawyer's total should be \\( 3 \\times 2200 = 6600 \\), which matches the given contribution.\n\nThus, Walter's friend gave \\(\\boxed{200}\\) dollars."
