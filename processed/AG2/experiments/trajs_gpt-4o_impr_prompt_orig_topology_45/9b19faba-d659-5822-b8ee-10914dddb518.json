Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's determine how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold over the three days and calculate the total earnings based on the given prices.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Boxes Sold Each Day:**\n   - **Saturday:**\n     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes\n     - Apple pie: Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday. Let's denote \\( x \\) as the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday. Therefore, apple pie boxes sold on Saturday = \\( x - 4 \\).\n\n   - **Sunday:**\n     - Gingerbread: He sold 5 more boxes than Saturday. Therefore, gingerbread boxes on Sunday = \\( 10 + 5 = 15 \\).\n     - Apple pie: 15 boxes\n\n   - **Monday:**\n     - Gingerbread: 2 boxes\n     - Apple pie: 4 boxes\n\n2. **Calculate Total Earnings:**\n   - Cost of one gingerbread box = \\$6\n   - Cost of one apple pie box = \\$15\n\n   - Total gingerbread boxes sold = 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) + 2 (Monday) = 27 boxes\n   - Total apple pie boxes sold = (x-4) (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) + 4 (Monday)\n\n   Since on Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer apple pie boxes than on Sunday, \\( x \\) is determined to be 15 (because he sold 15 apple pies on Sunday).\n\n   Thus, total apple pie boxes sold = (15-4) + 15 + 4 = 30 boxes\n\n   - Total earnings:\n     - Gingerbread: \\( 27 \\times 6 \\)\n     - Apple pie: \\( 30 \\times 15 \\)\n\n3. **Python Code to Calculate Earnings:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Symbol, Eq, solve\n\n# Constants\ngingerbread_price = 6\napple_pie_price = 15\n\n# Total boxes sold\ntotal_gingerbread_boxes = 27\ntotal_apple_pie_boxes = 30\n\n# Total earnings calculation\ntotal_earnings = (total_gingerbread_boxes * gingerbread_price) + (total_apple_pie_boxes * apple_pie_price)\n\n# Display result\nprint(\"Total earnings:\", total_earnings)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\nLet's verify the calculations step-by-step:\n- Gingerbread sold: 10 (Sat) + 15 (Sun) + 2 (Mon) = 27 boxes\n- Apple pie sold: 11 (Sat) + 15 (Sun) + 4 (Mon) = 30 boxes\n\nTotal earnings:\n- Gingerbread earnings: $27 \\times 6 = \\$162$\n- Apple pie earnings: $30 \\times 15 = \\$450$\n\nTotal = $162 + 450 = \\$612$. \n\nThus, Sunrise's earnings over three days are \\$612.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{612}\\)."
