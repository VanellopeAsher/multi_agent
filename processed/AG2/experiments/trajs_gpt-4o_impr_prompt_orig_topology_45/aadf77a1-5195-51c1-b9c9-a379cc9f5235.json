Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward mathematical approach by setting up an equation. The quilt's total area, measured in square feet, is comprised of the various types of t-shirts that Octavia used. The equation we set will factor in the known quantities of medium and large t-shirts and solve for the unknown quantity of small t-shirts.\n\nHere is the step-by-step approach for solving this problem:\n\n1. **Identify Known Values:**\n   - Each small t-shirt contributes 3 square feet.\n   - Each medium t-shirt contributes 4 square feet.\n   - Each large t-shirt contributes 6 square feet.\n   - Octavia used 8 medium t-shirts and 6 large t-shirts.\n   - The total quilt size is 101 square feet.\n\n2. **Define the Unknown:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of small t-shirts used.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   3x + 4(8) + 6(6) = 101\n   \\]\n   This equation accounts for the total area contributed by each type of t-shirt.\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(3*x + 4*8 + 6*6, 101)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsmall_shirts = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(small_shirts)\n```\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Calculate the area contributed by the medium t-shirts: \\( 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\) square feet.\n   - Calculate the area contributed by the large t-shirts: \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\) square feet.\n   - Calculate the total area contributed by small t-shirts: \\( 3 \\times \\text{{small shirts}} \\).\n   - Ensure the sum is 101 square feet: \\( 32 + 36 + 3 \\times \\text{{small shirts}} = 101 \\).\n\nRunning the code will yield the accurate number of small t-shirts used. Let's now evaluate the equation using the code provided. \n\nThe solution will tell us the number of small t-shirts Octavia used."

This means Octavia used 11 small t-shirts to create the quilt.\n\nTo verify:\n\n1. **Calculate Each Component:**\n   - Small t-shirts: \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\) square feet.\n   - Medium t-shirts: \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\) square feet.\n   - Large t-shirts: \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) square feet.\n\n2. **Sum of All Components:**\n   \\[\n   33 + 32 + 36 = 101\n   \\]\n   This confirms the total quilt size is indeed 101 square feet, verifying the calculation.\n\nHence, the solution is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."
