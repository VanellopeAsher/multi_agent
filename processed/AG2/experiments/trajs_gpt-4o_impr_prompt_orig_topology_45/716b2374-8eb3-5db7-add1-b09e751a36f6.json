Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each pack of cloths that Kim uses for cleaning.\n\n#### Key Idea:\nProfit is defined as the difference between total income and total expenses. We're provided with the total weekly income, profit, and some information about the expenses. We can set up equations to find the unknown cost of a pack of cloths.\n\n#### Given:\n- Weekly income = $92\n- Weekly profit = $20\n- Number of current clients = 3\n- Potential clients being considered = 5\n- Each client requires:\n  - 2 bottles of bleach\n  - 1 pack of cloths\n- Cost of one bottle of bleach = $2\n\n#### Objective:\nCalculate the cost of one pack of cloths.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of clients.\n2. Compute the total expenses using the information about bleach and cloths costs.\n3. Set up the equation for expenses using the profit equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Income} - \\text{Expenses}\n   \\]\n4. Solve for the cost of a pack of cloths.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it using Python with sympy for symbolic computation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Define the total number of clients\ncurrent_clients = 3\npotential_clients = 5\ntotal_clients = current_clients + potential_clients\n\n# Step 2: Define the variables\nC = symbols('C')  # Cost of one pack of cloths\n\n# Step 3: Total Expenses\n# Total bleach cost\nbleach_cost_per_client = 2 * 2  # 2 bottles per client, $2 per bottle\ntotal_bleach_cost = bleach_cost_per_client * total_clients\n\n# Total cloth cost\ntotal_cloth_cost = C * total_clients\n\n# Step 4: Calculate total expenses and form the equation using profit\ntotal_expenses = total_bleach_cost + total_cloth_cost\nincome = 92\nprofit = 20\n\n# Equation: Profit = Income - Expenses\nequation = Eq(profit, income - total_expenses)\n\n# Solve for C (cost of a pack of cloths)\ncloth_cost = solve(equation, C)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(cloth_cost)\n```\n\n#### VERIFICATION\n1. Verify the total number of clients:\n   - Current + Potential = 3 + 5 = 8\n2. Calculate bleach cost:\n   - 2 bottles/client x $2 = $4/client\n   - Total bleach cost for 8 clients = $4 x 8 = $32\n3. Verify profit equation:\n   - Profit = $20 = $92 - (Total expenses)\n   - Total expenses must be $92 - $20 = $72\n4. Verify that our equation leads to the correct value:\n   \\[\n   72 = 32 + 8C \\implies C = \\frac{72 - 32}{8} = 5\n   \\]\n5. Result: The cost of each pack of cloths is $5.\n\nNow, using the Python code we can get this result which provides a consistent verification.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
