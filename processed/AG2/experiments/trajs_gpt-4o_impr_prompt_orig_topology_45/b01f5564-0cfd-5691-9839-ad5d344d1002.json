Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of protein John consumes over a week given his daily intake of mushrooms.\n\n**Key Concept:**\nWe'll be using proportion calculations. The problem states the weight of mushrooms and the amount of protein they contain, and we need to find out the total protein intake based on John's daily consumption.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Identify Daily Intake:**\n   - The problem states a cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and contains 4 grams of protein.\n   - John eats 300 grams of mushrooms daily. \n\n2. **Calculate Daily Protein Intake:**\n   - If 150 grams contains 4 grams of protein, then 300 grams will contain twice the protein (since 300 is twice 150).\n\n3. **Calculate Weekly Protein Intake:**\n   - Determine how much protein John would consume in a week (7 days of the calculated daily intake).\n\nLet's implement this in Python using a direct solution approach:\n\n```python\n# Daily intake of mushrooms in grams\ndaily_mushroom_weight = 300\n\n# Protein content for 150 grams\nprotein_per_150g = 4\n\n# Calculate the protein for 300 grams\nprotein_per_day = (daily_mushroom_weight / 150) * protein_per_150g\n\n# Weekly protein intake (7 days)\nweekly_protein_intake = protein_per_day * 7\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Check Daily Calculation:**\n   - 150 grams = 4 grams of protein \n   - 300 grams is twice 150 grams, so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Daily Protein} = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ grams}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Weekly Calculation:**\n   - 8 grams/day for 7 days:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Weekly Protein} = 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\text{ grams}\n     \\]\n\nThe calculations appear consistent and correct. \n\nNow, let's execute and verify the output:\n\n```python\n# Daily intake of mushrooms in grams\ndaily_mushroom_weight = 300\n\n# Protein content for 150 grams\nprotein_per_150g = 4\n\n# Calculate the protein for 300 grams\nprotein_per_day = (daily_mushroom_weight / 150) * protein_per_150g\n\n# Weekly protein intake (7 days)\nweekly_protein_intake = protein_per_day * 7\n\n# Print the result\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\nThe correct output should confirm that John gets \\(\\boxed{56}\\) grams of protein in a week."
