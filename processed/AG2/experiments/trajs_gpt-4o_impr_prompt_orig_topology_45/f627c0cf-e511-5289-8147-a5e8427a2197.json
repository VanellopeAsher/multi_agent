Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "Let's solve this problem using a direct mathematical approach (Case 1: Direct Python Solution).\n\n**Key Idea:** We need to calculate the initial weight of Mark based on the information about his weight loss. The problem states that Mark loses 10 pounds each month, and eventually, his weight reached 70 pounds. We can set up an equation to find his initial weight based on these details.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n1. Let \\( x \\) be Mark's initial weight.\n2. If we denote the number of months that Mark was losing weight as \\( m \\), then the equation representing his weight after losing weight for \\( m \\) months is:\n   \\[\n   x - 10m = 70\n   \\]\n3. We need to solve this equation to find \\( x \\), considering \\( m \\) is the number of months he was losing weight.\n\nGiven problem lacks the number of months, \\( m \\). To proceed meaningfully, we must assume either \\( m \\) is given or calculate \\( x \\) with all valid cases. If \\( m \\) can't be determined, the initial formulation is incomplete, so let's write the code dealing with possibilities:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Variables\nx, m = symbols('x m')\n\n# Equation representing the weight loss condition\nequation = Eq(x - 10*m, 70)\n\n# Solving for x in terms of m\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\nprint(\"Initial weight (in terms of unknown months, m):\", initial_weight)\n```\n\nRunning this code, you will find that the solution depends on the duration (m) of his weight loss, which has not been provided. Thus, the problem as presented misses an essential piece of data.\n\nTherefore, we'll conclude that:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\]\n\nbecause missing data prevents us from knowing Mark's exact initial weight without further information."

The expression \\(10m + 70\\) gives us the initial weight in terms of the number of months \\(m\\) he was losing weight.\n\nWithout a specified value for \\(m\\), we can't arrive at a precise numerical solution. Thus, the problem remains unresolved due to the missing parameter. In this case, without specific data on \\(m\\), the initial weight can't be determined uniquely.\n\nTherefore, the solution remains:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that we need additional information about the duration of the weight loss to provide a complete solution."
