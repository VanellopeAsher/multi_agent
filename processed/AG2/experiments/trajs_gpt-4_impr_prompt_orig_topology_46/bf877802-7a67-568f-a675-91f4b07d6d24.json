Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "Approach: \n\nThis problem mainly involves trigonometry. Given the initial degrees of the great pyramids from Sahir's house and the rate at which the sun moves, we can calculate how many degrees the sun changes after a given period. \n\nLet's start by solving this step-by-step.\n\nInitial status:\nAccording to the problem statement, the pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when standing at the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid. Therefore, the initial angle from the ground to the sun (at the tip of the pyramid) is 32 degrees.\n\nStep 1: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees an hour for 10 hours:\nTherefore, the sun gains 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.\n\nStep 2: After 10 hours, the sun starts moving at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for the next 2 hours:\nTherefore, the sun gains 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.\n\nBy adding the angles gained from step 1 and step 2 to the initial status, we can calculate the total degrees from the ground to the sun.\n\nLet's do that now."

Thus, it gained an additional 3 * 2 = 6 degrees during this period. \n\nWhen we add these three angles, we get 32 + 50 + 6 = 88 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the verification confirms that our answer is correct. \n\nFinal Answer: The sun will be \\boxed{88} degrees from the ground after moving for a total of 12 hours at the given rates."
