Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $10. After 10 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

Let's go ahead with it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the initial cost per visit, the number of visits per year, and the number of years\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10\nvisits_per_year = 3\ninitial_years = 10\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first 10 years\ninitial_total_cost = initial_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * initial_years\nprint('First 10 years total cost:', initial_total_cost)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the new price per visit after an increases of 150%\nnew_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit * (1 + 150/100)\nprint('New cost per visit:', new_cost_per_visit)\n\n# New timeframe - 3 years\nadditional_years = 3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years\nadditional_total_cost = new_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * additional_years\nprint('Additional 3 years total cost:', additional_total_cost)\n\n# Step 4: Sum up the total cost from the first two steps\ntotal_cost = initial_total_cost + additional_total_cost\nprint('Total cost for 13 years:', total_cost)\n\n```"

For the first 10 years, the cost is 10*3 visits/year *10 years = 300, which matches with our calculated value.\n\n2. The new cost per visit after a 150% increase should be 10 + 10 * 150 / 100 = 25.0 dollars, which matches with our calculation.\n\n3. The total cost for the next 3 years with the new cost is 25*3 visits/year * 3 years = 225, which also is as expected.\n\n4. The total cost for 13 years is the sum of costs for the initial 10 years and the additional 3 years. So, it should be 300 + 225 = 525, this is also as expected.\n\nSo everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the total cost Pauline spent on all visits to the museum for those 13 years is $525.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{525}$."
