Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTara bought several packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. She painted them and sold them at a craft fair for $8 each. If she earned a profit of $160 on her bags, how many packs of 5 canvas bags Tara buy?"

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is setting up a profit formula. Our goal is to find the number of packs of 5 canvas bags that Tara bought. We know that the profit is made from the difference between the selling price of a bag and the buying price (i.e., $8 - $4 = $4) per bag. Since the bags were bought in packs of 5, each pack earned her a profit of 5 * $4 = $20. As the total profit is $160, we can set up the equation $160 = $20 * X, where X is the number of packs, which can be solved directly in Python.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the equation:\n\n```python\ntotal_profit = 160  # total profit\nprofit_per_pack = 20  # profit per pack\nnum_packs = total_profit / profit_per_pack  # number of packs\nprint(num_packs)\n```\n\nThis code will return the number of packs Tara bought to achieve a profit of $160."
