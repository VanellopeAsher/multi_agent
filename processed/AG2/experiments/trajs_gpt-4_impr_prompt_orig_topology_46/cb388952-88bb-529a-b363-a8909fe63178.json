Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 15 years less than ten times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

This condition can be represented as an equation:\n\n10*x - 15 = Carver's age\n\nSubstituting Carver's age,\n10*x - 15 = 45\n10*x = 45 + 15\n10*x = 60\nx = 60 / 10\nx = 6\n\nLet's verify this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given data\ncarver_age = 45\n\n# Calculating the son's age from the equation: 10*x - 15 = carver_age\nson_age = (carver_age + 15) / 10\n\nprint(son_age)\n```\nRunning this code should give us Carver's son's age.

      "content": "After running Python code that solves the equation, we've found that Carver's son is exactly 6 years old. To ensure the accuracy of this result, let's double-check by plugging it back into the original situation:\n\nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 15 years less than ten times the age of his son. If his son is 6 years old, then 10 times his age would be 60 years. Subtracting 15 from 60 indeed gives us 45, which matches Carver's age. Therefore, our solution of 6 years for the son's age is correct.\n\nSo, after our VERIFICATION, the final answer is his son is \\boxed{6} years old."
