  "problem": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.

It involves adding the apples gathered, setting up an equation from the provided information, and-solving it. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of apples Joanne collected:\n   Joanne gathered from the tallest trees + the shortest trees + the average trees.\n   From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half the amount from the tallest trees.\n\nStep 2: Identify the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathered:\n   She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne. The number of apples she gathers from the shortest trees is an unknown we need to identify.\n   The total number of apples she gathered equals the total number of gathered apples minus the total number of apples Joanne gathered.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation to express the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees. \n\nStep 4: Calculate how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees.\n\nPython can be used to perform all the above calculations.

We first calculated the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest, shortest, and average trees and summed them up.\n2. Next, we calculated how many apples Joanne's sister gathered. Knowing that she gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, the difference between the total apples gathered and those gathered by Joanne is the amount she gathered from the shortest trees.\n3. We then divided the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees by the number Joanne gathered from the shortest trees to find the number we were asked for.\n\nThe logic and calculations seem correct.\n\nSo, Joanne's sister gathered \\boxed{3.0} times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees."
