Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the market, Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges. She gifted her mother and her sibling two boxes each. She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself and sold the rest. If each box has 20 oranges, can you determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold?"

Determine the oranges left after gifting. \n4. Of those left, Mrs. Harrington kept a fourth for herself and sold the rest. Compute the quantity of oranges sold.\n\nLet's implement this process step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington purchased.\n```python\ntotal_boxes = 12\noranges_per_box = 20\ntotal_oranges = total_boxes * oranges_per_box\nprint(total_oranges)\n```\n\nStep 2: Calculate how many oranges she gifted to her mother and her sibling, then find the remaining oranges.\n```python\nboxes_gifted = 2 + 2  # to mother and sibling\noranges_gifted = boxes_gifted * oranges_per_box\noranges_left = total_oranges - oranges_gifted\nprint(oranges_left)\n```\n\nStep 3: Mrs. Harrington kept a quarter for herself and sold the rest. Calculate the oranges sold.\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\noranges_harrington = oranges_left/4\noranges_sold = oranges_left - oranges_harrington\nprint(oranges_sold)\n```"

We have determined that Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.\n\nLet's complete the verification steps:\n\nVerification Steps:\n1.    We calculated the total oranges starting with twelve boxes of twenty oranges each, totaling to 240 oranges. This is correct.\n2.    Mrs. Harrington then gifted four boxes (two to her mother and two to her sibling), which is 80 oranges in total. The remaining number of oranges after the gifts were given is 160, which is correct.\n3.    Mrs. Harrington kept a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself, i.e., 40 oranges. She sold the rest, which is found to be 120 oranges. This is correct.\n\nThe final solution to the problem aligns with our calculations. Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \boxed{120}."
