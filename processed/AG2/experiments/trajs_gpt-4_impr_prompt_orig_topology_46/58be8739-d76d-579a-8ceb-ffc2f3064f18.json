Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "Key Idea:\nThe total amount of time spent is the sum of the time boating, swimming, watching shows, and sightseeing. We know the proportion of time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows relative to the total. We need to extract the total time and subtract the known quantities to find the time spent on sightseeing.\n\nHere's a potential solution using Python:\n\n```python\n# The time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is given.\ntime_boating = 6  # in hours\ntime_swimming = time_boating / 2  # in hours\ntime_shows = 3 * 2  # in hours, 3 shows of 2 hours each\n\n# The sum of these times accounts for 30% of the total time.\ntime_known_activities = time_boating + time_swimming + time_shows\n\n# Hence, total time can be calculated as below\ntotal_time = time_known_activities / 0.3  # in hours\n\n# Finally, the time spent on sightseeing would be the total time minus the time spent on the other activities.\ntime_sightseeing = total_time - time_known_activities\n```\nWe can print the time spent on sightseeing as:\n\n```python\nprint(\"The time spent on sightseeing is\", time_sightseeing, \"hours.\")\n```"

      "content": "Great, the Python script seems to be working correctly, and it looks like we have the correct time that John spent sightseeing. \n\nFinal Answer Verification:\n\nLet's go through the results step by step:\n\n1. Time spent boating = 6 hours\n2. Time spent swimming = half of boating = 3 hours\n3. Time spent watching shows = 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours\n\nTotal time spent on these activities = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. \n\nThis amount of time corresponds to 30% of the total vacation time, which means the total vacation time is 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours.\n\nThen, the time spent sightseeing = total time - time for known activities = 50 - 15 = 35 hours.\n\nThis is consistent with the output of the Python script, so we can confidently say our answer is correct.\n\nFinal solution is:\n\nJohn spent \\boxed{35} hours sightseeing."
