Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 60 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 30 different shows which were 20 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

Therefore, John spent 800 hours sightseeing.\n\nTo assure accuracy of my calculations, let's go through each step of the process again:\n\n1. I computed the total time John spent on his activities by taking into account that the time he spent watching shows, which totaled at 600 hours, accounted for only 30% of his total time. This resulted in the total time being approximately 2000 hours.\n2. To find out how much time he spent sightseeing, I took 40% of the total time calculated above, yielding a final result of 800 hours.\n\nAfter performing this verification, I am quite confident in the final result.\n\nSo, the total time John spent sightseeing during his vacation is \\boxed{800} hours."
