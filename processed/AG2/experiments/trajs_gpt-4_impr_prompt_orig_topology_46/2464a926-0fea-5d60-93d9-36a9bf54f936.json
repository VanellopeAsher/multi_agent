Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJolene and her friends are celebrating the start of summer with a water balloon battle. They prepare 10 sets of balloons, each set containing 30 balloons. By the time the afternoon ends, there are only 12 balloons remaining. How many balloons were used in their water balloon fight?"

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is simple arithmetic. You first need to calculate the total number of balloons prepared, then subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the day. \n\nHere's how you can do it using Python:\n\n```python\n# Set the variables\nsets_of_balloons = 10\nballoons_per_set = 30\nballoons_left = 12\n\n# Calculate the total number of balloons made\ntotal_balloons = sets_of_balloons * balloons_per_set\n\n# Subtract the remaining balloons from the total to find out how many were used\nballoons_used = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\n# Output the answer\nprint(balloons_used)\n```\n\nAfter running this, you should obtain the number of balloons that were used in the water balloon fight."

Initially, Jolene prepared 10 sets of balloons, with each set having 30 balloons. This amounts to a total of 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.\n2. By afternoon's end, only 12 balloons were remaining. This means that the number of water balloons used in the fight would be 300 (total prepared) - 12 (the left ones) = 288.\n   \nThis matches your answer. So, the verified and final solution is \\(\\boxed{288}\\)."
