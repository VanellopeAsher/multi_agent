Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they use on the first day?"

      "content": "1. First, we need to find out how many total bandages the nurses have received across all three days. On the first day, they started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack, which contains 50 bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs. So, in total, they have received:\n\n```python\ntotal_received = 19 + 1*50 + 2*50\n```  \n2. Next, we need to figure out how many bandages the nurses used during these three days. We know from the problem that they used ten fewer bandages on the second day than the first day, and on the third day, they only used half a pack, which contains 25 bandages. With this information and knowing that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can calculate the number of bandages used on the first day by:\n\n```python\nfirst_day_used = total_received - second_day_used - third_day_used - remaining\n```  \n3. where 'second_day_used' is `first_day_used - 10` and 'third_day_used' is `0.5 * 50` and 'remaining' is `78`. We can rearrange the equation to isolate 'first_day_used':\n```python\nfirst_day_used = (total_received - 0.5 * 50 - 78 + 10) / 2    # Rearrange equation\n```\n\nLet's calculate these results using Python."

On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages (lower by 10 from the previous day), leaving them with 69 - 38 - 28 = 3 bandages.\n3. On the third day, they received 2 * 50 = 100 bandages, bringing their total to 3 + 100 = 103 bandages. On this day, they used 0.5 * 50 = 25 bandages, reducing their stock to 103 - 25 = 78 bandages.\n\nThis aligns with the problem statement, which stipulates 78 bandages remaining at the end of the third day.\n\nThe number of bandages used on the first day is therefore \boxed{38}."
