Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?"

      "content": "This seems to be a math problem of basic addition and multiplication. We need to calculate total cost from individual cost of each gum pack.\n\nLet's put together an approach:\n\n1. First find out how much Suzie spent on strawberry gum. Since each pack costs $2 and she bought two packs, we can multiply these two numbers to get the total cost.\n2. The grape flavored gum costs $2, and she bought one pack, so no additional math is needed.\n3. Finally, Suzie bought a pack of green apple flavored gum which was half the cost of the grape, so we divide the cost of grape ($2) by 2.\n4. Add all these cost to find out total cost.\n\nLet's write this calculation in Python code:\n\n```python\n# cost of each gum pack\ncost_strawberry = 2  \ncost_grape = 2\ncost_green_apple = cost_grape / 2\n\n# she bought two packs of strawberry flavored gum\nno_of_strawberry_packs = 2\n\n# Calculate total cost for each flavor\ntotal_strawberry = cost_strawberry * no_of_strawberry_packs\n\n# Total cost spent on gum\ntotal_cost = cost_grape + cost_green_apple + total_strawberry\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find out the total amount of money spent by Suzie."

So Suzie spent a total of $7 on gum.\n\nSo, the final answer is $7, as was obtained from the calculations.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{7}."
