Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJenna shares her living space with four other people. The monthly cost for electricity in their shared home is $100. If they split the cost evenly, what would be the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill?"

      "content": "Approach to the Solution:\nThis problem is a mathematics type problem that requires a multiplication operation. \n\nWe know that an year is composed of 12 months. So, if the monthly cost for electricity is $100 and there are 5 roommates who share the cost of electricity equally, each person's annual contribution towards the electricity bill can be found by following these steps:\n1. Find the individual contribution per month by dividing the total monthly cost by the number of roommates.\n2. Multiply the monthly individual cost by 12 to find the annual cost.\n\nLet's Break Down the Solution in Python:\n\nFirstly, we get the monthly contribution by dividing the monthly cost by number of roommates. Then we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the annual cost per person.\n\nCoding Solution:\n```python\n# Costs, number of roommates, and months in a year\ntotal_monthly_cost = 100\nnumber_of_roommates = 5\nmonths_in_year = 12\n\n# Individual monthly contribution\nindividual_monthly_cost = total_monthly_cost / number_of_roommates\n\n# Individual annual contribution\nindividual_annual_contribution = individual_monthly_cost * months_in_year\n\nprint(\"Each person's annual contribution is:\", individual_annual_contribution)\n```\n\nI will now wait for you to compute the output using the above Python code and respond back to me with the result."

      "content": "Thank you for providing the result. \n\nVerification:\n\nTo ensure that the result is correct, we will use the formula individual_annual_contribution = individual_monthly_cost * months_in_year.\n    We then substitute the following values:\n    individual_monthly_cost = total_monthly_cost / number_of_roommates = 100 / 5 = 20\n    months_in_year = 12\n    So, individual_annual_contribution = 20 * 12 = 240\n\nFrom the Python script, we obtained 240 as the answer, and manual verification also resulted in 240. Thus, we can conclude that the final answer is correct. \n\nYour final result is that the annual cost of electricity for each roommate is $240. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 240. \n\nRemember to place only numerical values inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside. So you can represent the final result as \boxed{240} dollars."
