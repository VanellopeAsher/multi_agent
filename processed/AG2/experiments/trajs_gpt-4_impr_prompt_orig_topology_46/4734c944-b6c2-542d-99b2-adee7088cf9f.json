      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2.5 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?"

      "content": "Key idea: We know that he has $70 to spend for the week. Given that he is spending an equal amount each day, we will first find out how much he spends daily by dividing the total amount by 7 (which is the number of days in a week). \n\nAlso, knowing the cost of each type of action figure, we can calculate how many of each he can buy daily. The total number of action figures will then be calculated by multiplying the amount he gets daily by the number of days he spends on each type of figure.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ntotal_money = 70 # Total money Peter has\ntotal_days = 7 # Total number of days in a week\n\n# Calculate amount spent daily\ndaily_spent = total_money / total_days\n\n# Cost of each type of action figure\nwooden_figure_cost = 5\nplastic_figure_cost = 2.5\n\n# Calculate how many wooden and plastic action figures he can buy daily\nwooden_figures_daily = math.floor(daily_spent / wooden_figure_cost)\nplastic_figures_daily = math.floor(daily_spent / plastic_figure_cost)\n\n# Since he buys wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday (4 days), \n# and plastic action figures for the rest of the week (3 days), \nwooden_figures_total = wooden_figures_daily * 4\nplastic_figures_total = plastic_figures_daily * 3\n\n# The total action figures will then be the addition of the two totals\ntotal_action_figures = wooden_figures_total + plastic_figures_total\n\nprint(total_action_figures)\n```\n\nRemember to always use the floor division as he can't buy a fraction of an action figure."
