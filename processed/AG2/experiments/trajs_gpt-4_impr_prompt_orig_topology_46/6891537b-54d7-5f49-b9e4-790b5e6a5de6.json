Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "Alright, let's begin the solution.\n\nFirstly, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards per deck and 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards each box. Thus, the total number of cards can be calculated using the expression `6*25 + 5*40`.\n\nAfterwards, we know that Miss Maria keeps 50 cards and distribute the remaining to her students. Thus, the number of cards given by Maria to her students can be calculated by subtracting 50 from the total number.\n\nFinally, as each student gets 10 cards, we can find the total number of students by dividing the number of cards given to students by 10.\n\nHere comes the Python code for it:\n\n```python\n# total cards Miss Maria has\ntotal_cards = 6*25 + 5*40\n\n# cards Miss Maria gives to her students\ncards_to_students = total_cards - 50\n\n# total students Miss Maria have\ntotal_students = cards_to_students // 10\n\n# printing the answer\nprint(total_students)\n```"

To verify, ensure that your code accurately reflects the problem statement:\n\n- She initially has a total of $(6*25 + 5*40)$ cards.\n- She keeps 50 cards for herself.\n- She distributes the rest of the cards to her students evenly, with each student getting 10 cards.\n\nThe correctness of the final calculation, which divides the number of distributed cards by 10 (the number of cards each student receives), confirms that the Python script works as expected. Hence, the solution or final answer is \\boxed{30}."
