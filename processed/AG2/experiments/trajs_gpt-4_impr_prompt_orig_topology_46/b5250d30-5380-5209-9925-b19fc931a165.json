Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery Saturday, Jill along with her companions view 4 films and on Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays. If this routine is followed every weekend, what is the total number of films they can view in a span of 4 weeks?"

Since they watch 4 films on Saturdays, they watch 2 films on Sundays (half of 4).\n3. If they continue this behavior every day of the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) for 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies watched.\n\nQuery to be computed:\nThe overall total will be the number of movies watched on Saturdays plus the number of movies watched on Sundays, all multiplied by 4 (for the 4 weeks span).\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of films watched on Saturdays\nnum_saturday_films = 4 \n\n# Number of films watched on Sundays (half of Saturday's films)\nnum_sunday_films = num_saturday_films / 2  \n\n# Calculate total number of films watched in a week (Saturday + Sunday)\ntotal_weekend_films = num_saturday_films + num_sunday_films  \n\n# Total number of films watched in 4 weeks\ntotal_4week_films = total_weekend_films * 4 \n\nprint(total_4week_films)\n```"

Verify your solution step by step: \n\n     1) Number of films watched on Saturdays is 4 and on Sundays is 2 (which is half of Saturday's films): Correct.\n\n     2) Total films in a weekend (Saturday + Sunday) is 6: Correct.\n\n     3) Total number of films watched in 4 weeks is 24 (6 films * 4 weeks): Correct.\n\n3. Now, I am confident in the verification and the final answer:\n\nThe total number of films Jill and her friends can watch in a span of 4 weeks is 24. \n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{24}."
