      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up several packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?"

Calculate the total number of initially available water balloons by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack.\n2. Subtract the number of remaining balloons from the total to get the number of thrown balloons.\n\nWe can directly solve this problem using Python.\n\nLet's say:\n- There were `i` packs of water balloons initially,\n- Each pack had `j` water balloons, and\n- There are `k` water balloons left.\n\nWe will use the expression `i*j - k` to get the number of thrown water balloons.\n\nPlease provide me with the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`."

Let's continue with solving the problem using Python. \n\nWe know:\n- each pack contains 30 balloons,\n- there are `i` packs,\n- and 12 balloons left.\n\nFirst step is to express the number of total balloons initially. This can be calculated as the number of packs multiplied by the number of balloons per pack.\n\nMissing Information: We need the initial number of balloon packs(`i`).\n\nAfter determining the total number of balloons initially, we will subtract the number of balloons left (12) from this total. This will tell us how many balloons were thrown. Until we get the the number of balloon packs(`i`), we can't proceed with solving this problem. Therefore, for now our answer will remain \\boxed{None}."
