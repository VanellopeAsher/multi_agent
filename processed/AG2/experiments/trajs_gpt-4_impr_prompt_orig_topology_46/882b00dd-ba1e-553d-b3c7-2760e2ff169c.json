Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

Subtracting Sally's total earnings from Billy's to get the required solution.\n\nBilly's earnings can be calculated in two steps:\n  * From his hire date to his first raise (2 months), his hourly rate was $10.\n  * From his first raise to his first work anniversary (10 months, because he already worked 2 months before the first raise), his hourly rate was increased by $0.5, so it is $10.50.\n  * After his first work anniversary, his hourly rate increased to $10.50+$1=$11.50\n\nSally's earnings can also be calculated in two steps:\n  * For the first 2 months of employment, her hourly rate was $10.50 (Billy's starting salary + $0.50)\n  * After 2 months, her rate became $11 (her previous rate + $0.5)\n\nLet's implement this solution using Python."

As the problem states that both of them work 20 hours, we need to calculate the total earnings based on their hourly rates.\n\n```python\n# hours worked by both\nhours = 20\n\n# Billy's hourly rates\nbilly_hourly_rate_start = 10\nbilly_hourly_rate_after_first_raise = billy_hourly_rate_start + 0.5\nbilly_hourly_rate_after_second_raise = billy_hourly_rate_after_first_raise + 1\n\n# Sally's hourly rates\nsally_hourly_rate_start = billy_hourly_rate_start + 0.5\nsally_hourly_rate_after_raise = sally_hourly_rate_start + 0.5\n\n# Billy's earnings: hourly rate * hours\nbilly_earnings = billy_hourly_rate_after_second_raise * hours\n\n# Sally's earnings: hourly rate * hours\nsally_earnings = sally_hourly_rate_after_raise * hours\n\n# Difference in earnings\nearnings_difference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\nearnings_difference\n```\n\nIn the above code, we first define the hourly rates for both employees, then calculate their earnings by multiplying their hourly rates by the number of hours. Finally, we calculate the difference in earnings by subtracting Sally's earnings from Billy's. Let's see what value we get for earnings_difference."
