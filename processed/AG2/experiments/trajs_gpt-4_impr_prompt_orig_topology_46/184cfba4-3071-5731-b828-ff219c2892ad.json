Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

      "content": "Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold as S, and the number of large stuffed animals as L. \n\nShe sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.\n\nThe price for each large stuffed animal is three times that of a small one, which is 3*$40 = $120.\n\nTeresa earned $1200 from selling S small stuffed animals and L large ones. Therefore, we can write down this equation: $40*S + $120*L = $1200.\n\nWe can solve the equations to find the value of S.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nS, L = symbols('S L')\n\n# Define the equations according to the problem\neq1 = Eq(S, 2*L)\neq2 = Eq(40*S + 120*L, 1200)\n\n# Substitute S from eq1 into eq2\neq2_substituted = eq2.subs(S, 2*L)\n\n# Solve the equation for L\nL_value = solve(eq2_substituted, L)[0]\n\n# Substitute L_value into eq1 to get S\nS_value = solve(eq1.subs(L, L_value), S)[0]\n\nprint(S_value)\n```"

Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nWe can verify the solution with these steps:\n\n- Confirm that the number of small stuffed animals (S) is twice the number of large stuffed animals (L). Given L = 3 and S = 2 * L, so then S = 6, which concurs with what we found before.\n- Confirm that total earnings are $1200. Small stuffed animals sold contributed $40 * S = $40 * 12 = $480. Large stuffed animals sold contributed $120 * L = $120 * 6 = $720. The total earnings = $480 + $720 = $1200, which concurs with the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is correct. \n\nThe number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is found to be \boxed{12}."

Let's verify:\n\nThe number of large stuffed animals sold would be half that of small animals. So, L = S/2 = 12/2 = 6.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for thrice the price of the small ones. So the price of the large stuffed animals is 3 * $40 = $120.\n\nThe total amount Teresa earned is the sum of earnings from small and large stuffed animals:\nTotal earnings = price_small * number_sold_small + price_large * number_sold_large\n= $40 * 12 + $120 * 6 = $480 + $720 = $1200\n\nThis is consistent with the information provided, so our solution, \\boxed{12}, is confirmed."
