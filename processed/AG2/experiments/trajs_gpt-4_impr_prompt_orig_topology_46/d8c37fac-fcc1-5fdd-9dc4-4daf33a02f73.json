Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKatherine has 50 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece. How much will she spend filling all 50 hanging baskets?"

However, we will calculate using a Python script for more reliable results.\n\nThe steps to solve this problem are:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for the petunias in one basket.\n2. Calculate the total cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket.\n3. Add these two sums to find the total cost of one basket.\n4. Multiply the total cost for one basket by the number of baskets to find the total cost.\n\nHere's the corresponding Python code:\n\n```python\n# costs per unit\npetunias_cost = 3.00\nsweet_potatoes_cost = 2.50\n\n# quantities per basket\npetunias_quantity = 30\nsweet_potatoes_quantity = 20\n\n# total number of baskets\nbaskets_num = 50\n\n# cost per basket\nbasket_cost = petunias_cost * petunias_quantity + sweet_potatoes_cost * sweet_potatoes_quantity\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = basket_cost * baskets_num\n```\n\nFollowing these steps should yield the correct total cost."

So the total cost is $140.00 * 50 = $\u00007000.00.\n\nFollowing the verification process, the total cost that Katherine will spend to fill all 50 hanging baskets is $7000.00. \n\nFinal Answer: Katherine will spend $\\boxed{7000}$ on filling all 50 hanging baskets."
