Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses. How many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi each time?"

      "content": "Let's break down the problem:\n\nSaanvi combined a certain amount of one medicine (let's call this 'medicine_1') with 3 times that amount of the second medicine (let's call this 'medicine_2'). Therefore, for each dose,\n- The quantity of medicine_1 = x mL,\n- The quantity of medicine_2 = 3x mL.\n\nThe sum of these quantities is:\n- The total quantity per dose = x + 3x = 4x mL.\n\nThe problem states there are 8 doses totaling to 448 mL. Thus, the equation becomes:\n- 4x * 8 = 448,\nor\n- x * 8 = 448 / 4.\n\nWe can solve for x (medicine_1) from this equation.\n\nI'll calculate that now."

Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine and 3*14 mL = 42 mL of the second medicine in each dose. This totals to 14+42 = 56 mL for each dose.\n2. Over 8 doses, this would total to 56*8 = 448 mL. This matches the total quantity given in the problem.\n\nHence, the solution is verified.\n\n"
