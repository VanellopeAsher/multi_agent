It's my mistake. The solve function's returned an empty list because the equation system doesn't have solutions. It's however strange because we have two equations and three variables, which should theoretically have a solution.\n\nSo there's a mistake in our equations' system or/and mathematical model. Let's find what's wrong.\n\nAccording to the problem, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and the number of wolves killed is three times of the number of cougars killed today, which leads to our equations, so it seems correct.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that both cougars and wolves are killed every day, meaning both C1 and C2 are greater than zero, and W1 also equals 10 which is greater than zero. Therefore, we know W2 also should be greater than zero.\n\nHowever, in our equation system, if we assume W2 equals 0, then C2 equals 0 from the second equation (W2 = 3 * C2), but at the same time, from the first equation (W2 = 3 * C1 - 9), since C1 is greater than zero, it gives us negative W2, which contradicts the assumption of W2 equals 0. Therefore, W2 cannot be 0, meaning the number of cougars killed today (C2) also cannot be 0. And since C2 equals C1 minus 3, the number of cougars killed yesterday (C1) must be greater than 3. \n\nIn conclusion, there must be some mistakes in the original problem. Could you please verify the original problem again?"

I reread the problem and see that I made a mistake in the forming of the equations. \n\nWe can simplify the problem by making these equations:\n\n1) W1 = 10 (Wolves killed at night)\n2) W2 = 3 * C2 (Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars)\n3) C2 = C1 - 3 (Today Rick killed three less cougars than the previous night)\n\nBut we also know that the number of cougars killed the first night (C1) equals to the number of cougars killed the second day (C2) plus 3. This gives us:\n\n4) C1 = C2 + 3\n\nWe can substitute equation 4 into equation 2:\n\n5) W2 = 3 * (C1 - 3)\n\nTherefore, we can solve equation 5 to find the value of W2. \n\nGiven W2, we then use equation 3 to find C2, and equation 4 to find C1.\n\nFinally, the total number of animals Rick killed would be W1 + C1 + W2 + C2.\n\nLet's calculate it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbols\nW2, C2, C1 = symbols('W2 C2 C1')\n\n# define the first equation\nequation_1 = Eq(W2, 3 * (C1 - 3))\n\n# solve the first equation\nsolution_1 = solve(equation_1)\nW2 = solution_1[0]\n\n# define the second equation and third equation\nequation_2 = Eq(C2, C1 - 3)\nequation_3 = Eq(C1, C2 + 3)\n\n# solve the second and third equations\nsolution_2_3 = solve((equation_2, equation_3))\n\nC1 = solution_2_3[C1]\nC2 = solution_2_3[C2]\n\n# calculate the total number of animals Rick killed\ntotal_animals = 10 + C1 + W2 + C2\n\nprint(total_animals)\n```\nApologies for the confusion in my previous messages. It was my oversight. Actually, statement \"Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.\" can gives us two equations:\n- the number of wolves killed today (W2) equals three times the number of cougars killed today (C2)\n- the number of cougars killed today (C2) equals the number of cougars killed yesterday (C1) minus 3\n\nSo, we have three variables W2, C1, C2, and two equations. In fact, this is an underdetermined system of equations and might have multiple solutions not a single one. However, assuming that the number of animals killed should be integer and positive, we can find a suitable solution.\n\nLet's correct our equations and retry to calculate:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# define the symbols for the number of animals killed\nC1, C2, W2 = symbols('C1 C2 W2')\n\n# set up the equation system\nequations = [\n    3 * C2 - W2,\n    C1 - 3 - C2\n]\n\n# solve for the number of animals each day\nsolution = solve(equations)\n\n# sum up the total number of animals killed\ntotal_animals = 10 + sum(solution.values())\n\nprint(total_animals)\n```"
