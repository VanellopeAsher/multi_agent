Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?"

After that, we will calculate the daily deficit he needs to meet his goal. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total days from December 31st (today) to July 19th (Andy's birthday).\nStep 2: Calculate the total pounds Andy needs to lose (which is 30 lbs. as given in the problem statement).\nStep 3: Convert the total pounds to calories.

This information is given in problem statement, so we don't need to calculate it.\n\nStep 3:\n\nTo convert the total pounds to calories, as 1 lbs = 3500 calories, we just multiply the total lbs Andy wants to lose for 3500. Let's calculate it in Python:\n\n```python\ntotal_lbs = 30\ntotal_calories = total_lbs * 3500\nprint('Total Calories: ', total_calories)\n```\n\nStep 4:\n\nTo calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to meet his goal we divide total calories by total days:\n\n```python\ndaily_calorie_deficit = total_calories / total_days\nprint('Daily calorie deficit: ', daily_calorie_deficit)\n```\n\nWe will have to run this code in Python to get the answer."
