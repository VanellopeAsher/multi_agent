Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein. If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?"

The number of grams of protein John gets per week can be found by multiplying the protein content per gram of mushroom with the number of grams of mushrooms John eats each day and then multiplying by 7 (the number of days in a week).\n\nHere are the steps we will follow:\n\n1. Find protein content per gram of mushroom\n2. Find protein content in grams of mushroom John eats daily\n3. Multiply by 7 to find protein content for the week\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n"

      "content": "Great. After careful verification of the calculations, I can confirm that John gets a total of 56 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms. This was determined by first calculating the protein content per gram of mushroom as 4 grams protein / 150 grams mushroom. Then, we multiplied this by 300 grams, which is John's daily intake of mushrooms, to get the daily protein intake. Finally, we multiplied this daily amount by 7 to obtain the weekly protein intake.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{56}."
