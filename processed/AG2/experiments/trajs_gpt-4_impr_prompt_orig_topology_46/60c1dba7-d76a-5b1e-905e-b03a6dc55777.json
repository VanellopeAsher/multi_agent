Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards. There is a total of 447 cards. Becca has 15 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards that PJ has. How many cards does Becca have?"

It involves generating equations based on the given problem and then solving these equations.\n\nThe appropriate steps to solve these equations, first, we will denote their quantities of cards with: b for Becca, s for Smendrick, and p for PJ.\n\nThen we will translate the problem into following equations based on the provided description:\n1. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick ==> b = s + 15\n2. Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards that PJ has ==> s = 4 * p\n3. There is a total of 447 cards ==> b + s + p = 447\n\nNow, we can simplify our equations and solve for b, s, and p."

Then it solves these equations using the solve() function from sympy package. It returns a dictionary where the keys are the symbols (b, s, p) and the values are the corresponding solutions. So, the final number of cards that Becca has will be found as a value associated with the 'b' key in the dictionary."

So, we can write: b = s + 15 and s = 4 * p\n\nSubstituting the obtained numbers, we get:\n\nFor Becca: b = 192 + 15 = 207. Which matches with the obtained result.\n\nFor Smendrick: s = 4 * 48 = 192. Which also matches with the obtained result.\n\nFinally, to verify the total number of cards, we should have b + s + p = 447, substituting the values, we get: \n\n207 + 192 + 48 = 447. Which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is verified and correct. Becca has \\boxed{207} cards."
