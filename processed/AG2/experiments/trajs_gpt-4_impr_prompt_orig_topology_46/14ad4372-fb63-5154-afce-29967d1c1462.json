      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday. On Sundays, she takes a break and doesn't teach any classes. Each class has 15 students. She charges $15.00 per student for each class. Additionally, she offers a free 5-minute warm-up session before each class, which doesn't affect her earnings. How much money does she make in 1 week?"

      "content": "Key Idea: The total money Judy makes in a week is a product of the number of classes she teaches in a week, the number of students in each class, and the money she charges per student for each class.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches from Monday to Friday.\n2. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches on Saturday.\n3. Add the totals from (1) and (2) to get the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.\n4. Multiply the total number of classes in a week by the number of students in each class.\n5. Multiply the result from (4) by the money Judy charges per student for each class.\n\nLet's implement these steps in the following Python code: \n\n```python\n# step 1: total number of classes from Monday to Friday\ntotal_classes_mon_to_fri = 5 * 5  # 5 classes per day for 5 days\n\n# step 2: total number of classes on Saturday\ntotal_classes_sat = 8\n\n# step 3: total number of classes in a week\ntotal_classes_week = total_classes_mon_to_fri + total_classes_sat\n\n# step 4: total number of students in a week\ntotal_students_week = total_classes_week * 15  # 15 students per class\n\n# step 5: total money Judy makes in a week\ntotal_money_week = total_students_week * 15  # $15 per student per class\n\ntotal_money_week\n```\n\nPlease input the total money Judy makes in a week in the format \boxed{_the_number_}."

      "content": "Great! Now let's verify the results:\n\n1. There are 5 days from Monday to Friday, and Judy teaches 5 classes each day. So she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes from Monday to Friday.\n2. On Saturday, Judy teaches 8 classes.\n3. By adding the number of classes on Monday to Friday and on Saturday, we get 25 + 8 = 33 classes in the week.\n4. Each class contains 15 students, so Judy teaches 33 * 15 = 495 students in a week.\n5. Judy charges $15.00 per student, so she makes 495 * 15 = $7425.00 in a week.\n\nThe calculation process is logical and the number you provided matches this logic, which is $7425.00.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\boxed{7425}."
