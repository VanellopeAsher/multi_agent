  "problem": "Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $2000, regardless of how many guests attend. While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.

The total cost for the second venue is $250 per guest, which we can express as 250g.\n\nTo find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we solve the equation: 2000 + 50g = 250g\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation to find the value of 'g'."

If fewer than 10 people attend, the first venue would be a less expensive option. However, if more than 10 individuals attend, the second venue becomes a cheaper alternative. \n\nInterim result: We've ascertained that attendance by exactly 10 guests would equalize the cost of hosting the party in either venue. Below, we'll verify this result.\n\nVERIFICATION:\nLet's verify by substituting 'g' with 10 in our original equation.\n\nFor the first venue: cost is 2000 + 50*(10) = $2500\nFor the second venue: cost is 250*(10) = $2500\n\nOur result has been validated, as both the first and second venues would cost exactly $2500 if 10 guests attended the party.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of guests for the costs to be equal is 10.\n\nSo, the final result in a box is 10. So, the answer is \\boxed{10}."
