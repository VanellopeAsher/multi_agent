Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?"

      "content": "Key Idea: As there are 7 days in a week, we could first compute the number of eggs Claire consumes weekly. After that, we multiply the result by 12 to get the total eggs consumed in 12 weeks. We know that a dozen eggs is 12, so finally, we divide the total eggs consumed by 12 to calculate the dozens consumed.\n\nLet's break it down further:\n\nStep 1: Identify how many eggs Claire consumes in a week.\nStep 2: Multiply the result by 12 to find the total number of eggs used over 12 weeks.\nStep 3: Divide that number by 12 (a dozen eggs) to get the number of dozens of eggs.\n\nNow let's translate these steps into Python code:\n\n```python\neggs_per_omelet = 3\ndays_per_week = 7\nweeks = 12\n\n# Steps 1, 2, and 3\neggs_per_week = eggs_per_omelet * days_per_week\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_week * weeks\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / 12\ndozens_of_eggs\n```"

Therefore, in a week, which consists of 7 days, she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs.\n2. Now extend this to a 12-week period. Claire would have eaten 21 * 12 = 252 eggs - this is consistent with our earlier calculation.\n3. Finally, knowing that there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we find that Claire has eaten 252 / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs.\n\nGiven that our verification checks out, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\nFinal Answer: Claire eats \boxed{21} dozens of eggs in 12 weeks."

Therefore, in a week - which consists of 7 days - she will use 3 * 7 = 21 eggs. Over a period of 12 weeks, she uses 21 * 12 = 252 eggs or 252 / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs.\n\nSo, Claire will use \\boxed{21} dozens of eggs in twelve weeks."
