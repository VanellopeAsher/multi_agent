Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 50 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

      "content": "Key Concept: Let's use the concept of division for this problem. First, we'll divide the total length of the ribbon by 40 to find the length of each section after the first cut. Then, we'll divide the length of each section by 50, which will give us the length of each final cut.\n\nApproach: Direct Python Solution\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the following steps:\n1. Assign the total length of ribbon to a variable.\n2. Compute the length of each section after the first cut by dividing the total length by 40.\n3. Find the final length by dividing the length of each section from the second cut by 50.\n\nFollowing is the Python code to get the final length of each cut. \n\n```python\n# Assign the total length of ribbon\ntotal_length = 10000 # millimeters\n\n# Compute the first cut\nfirst_cut_length = total_length / 40\n\n# Compute the final cut\nfinal_cut_length = first_cut_length / 50\n\n# print the final cut length\nprint(final_cut_length)\n```"

After the first round of cuts, you're left with 40 ribbons, each 250 millimeters long.\n3. Following the second round of cuts, you end up with 2,000 ribbons, each 5 millimeters long.\n\nThus, the final length of each piece of ribbon, after both rounds of cuts, is \boxed{5} millimeters."
