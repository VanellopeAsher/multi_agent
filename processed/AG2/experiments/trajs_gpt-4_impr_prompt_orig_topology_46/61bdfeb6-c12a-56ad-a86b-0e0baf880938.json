Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSamwell owns an appliance store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, one-fifth are projection TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?"

Then we subtract the sum of these three types from the total number of TVs to find the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nLet's write a program to calculate it step by step. \n\n```python\n# Total number of TVs sold\ntotal_sold = 40\n\n# Number of Smart TVs sold\nsmart_tvs = (1/4) * total_sold\n\n# Number of Analog TVs sold\nanalog_tvs = (1/8) * total_sold\n\n# Number of Projection TVs sold\nprojection_tvs = (1/5) * total_sold\n\n# Number of OLED TVs sold\noled_tvs = total_sold - smart_tvs - analog_tvs - projection_tvs\n\nprint(\"Number Of OLED TVs Sold: \", oled_tvs)\n```\n\nWe can see that the number of OLED TVs sold depends on the results of line 6, 9, and 12.\n\nCan you please compute these numbers by running the above Python code?"

If we subtract the total of Smart, Analog, and Projection TVs (which is 23) from the total TVs sold, we get 40 - 23 = 17 TVs. \n\nThis means the number of OLED TVs sold was 17 which matches with our computed answer.\n\nThe final result is: \boxed{17}."
