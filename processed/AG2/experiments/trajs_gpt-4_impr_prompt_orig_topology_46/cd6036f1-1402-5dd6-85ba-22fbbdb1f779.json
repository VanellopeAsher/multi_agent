Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. During his recovery, he managed to regain 5 pounds per month for 2 months. If his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight before he fell ill?"

If we calculate his total weight loss and gain, we can find his initial weight by considering his final weight.\n\nStep-by-Step Process:\n1. Calculate the total weight Mark lost in 3 months.\n2. Calculate the total weight Mark gained in 2 months.\n3. Combine the losses and gains to understand how his weight changed.\n4. Add this change (the net loss over the entire period) to his final weight to get his initial weight before complication started.\n\nNow let's follow these steps in the Python code."

So total weight lost = 3*10 = 30 pounds.\n    b. Then he regained weight for 2 months, each month he gained 5 pounds. So total weight gained = 2*5 = 10 pounds.\n    c. The net weight that Mark lost over this period = total lost - total gained = 30-10 = 20 pounds.\n    d. Given that his final weight after the recovery was 70 pounds, his initial weight before his complication started = final weight + net weight loss = 70 + 20 = 90 pounds.\n\nAll the calculations have been verified and the answer is correct.\n\nSo the initial weight of Mark before he fell ill was \\boxed{90} pounds."
