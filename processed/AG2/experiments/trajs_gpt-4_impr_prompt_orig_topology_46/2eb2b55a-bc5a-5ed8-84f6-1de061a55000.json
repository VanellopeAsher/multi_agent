Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack. On the initial day, the medical staff utilized 38 bandages and procured one large pack of bandages. The following day, they used ten bandages less than the previous day.

In this case, we're only doing arithmetic calculations so we do not need any specific Python library.\n\nNow, we'll go through the problem day by day:\n\n1) On the first day, the staff starts with an unknown number of bandages, which is what we need to find out. They use 38 bandages and buy a pack of 50 more.\n2) On the second day, they use 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.\n3) On the third day, they buy two packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and use half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages).\n\nSince there are 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, the number of bandages the staff had on the first day can be calculated by summing the bandages used and bought across the three days and then subtracting the bandages left at the end.\n\nLet's implement this in Python."
