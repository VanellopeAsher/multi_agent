Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution.

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: Direct Python Solution\n\nKey Idea: In this problem, we need to find how far Polly could be from the dragon while still able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the gemstone.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Compute the maximum throwing distance of Polly when she holds the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, she can throw for 4000 feet but with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, which means the total throw distance would be 3*4000 = 12000 feet.\n2. Subtract the dragon's flame radius (10000 feet) from Polly's maximum javelin throw distance when she's holding the gemstone.\n\n```python\n# Maximum throwing distance of Polly when she holds the gemstone\nmax_throwing_distance_gemstone = 3 * 4000 \n\n# The distance Polly could stand outside of the reach of the dragon's flame \ndistance_outside_flame = max_throwing_distance_gemstone - 10000\nprint(distance_outside_flame)\n```\n\nVerification:\n1. Double-check the solution with the problem statement. Polly's throwing distance of the javelin does indeed increase three times when she holds the gemstone. And the slaying of the dragon considers the radius of the dragon's flames. The solution also assumes that both Polly and the dragon are on the same ground level, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.\n2. Verify the values used: javelin throwing distance without the gemstone is 4000 feet, with the gemstone is 3 * 4000 feet = 12000 feet, and the dragon's flame distance is 10000 feet. The values are correctly used in the calculation.\n3. Therefore, the final result of the distance that Polly can stand outside the dragon's flames is 12000 - 10000 feet."

To summarize:\n\nPolly can normally throw the gold javelin a distance of 4000 feet. However, when she holds the sapphire gemstone, her throwing distance triples to 12000 feet. The dragon's fire can reach up to 10000 feet, which is within Polly's enhanced throwing distance when she holds the gemstone. By subtracting the dragon's fire radius from Polly's enhanced throwing distance, we find that Polly can stand 2000 feet outside the reach of the dragon's fire and still successfully hit the dragon with the javelin.\n\nThus, the final answer is that Polly can stand \boxed{2000} feet outside the reach of the dragon's fire to safely slay the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone."
