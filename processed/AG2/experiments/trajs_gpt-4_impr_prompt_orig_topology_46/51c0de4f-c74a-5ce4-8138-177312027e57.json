Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money. If Walter's lawyer contributed $6600 in total, how much did his friend give him?"

We can figure out the answer by a few simple calculations.\n\nAccording to the problem, Walter first collected $500 from his neighbors and then $1500 from an online fund. \n\nAlso, his lawyer donated three times the amount that everyone else did. That means, if we denote the amount given by the friend as X, the lawyer gave 3*(500 + 1500 + X). \n\nThe total donation by the lawyer is also given as $6600. \n\nFrom this information, we can set up the following equation:\n3 * (500 + 1500 + X) = 6600\n\nBy solving this equation, we can find the amount that the friend gave."

We simplify the left side first by multiplying the numbers:\n\n3*2000 + 3*X = 6600\n\nAnd simplify it again to:\n6000 + 3*X = 6600\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3*X = 6600 - 6000\n3*X = 600\n\nFinally, we solve for X:\n\nX = 600 / 3\nX = 200\n\nSo, Walter's friend gave him $200. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{200}."
