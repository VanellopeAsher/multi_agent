      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "Approach:\n\nGiven that there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, which we know are two-thirds of the total Scottish unicorns, we can find the total number of Scottish unicorns. Since it is mentioned that a third of the total unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can find out the total number of unicorns. Let's break this down into the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\nStep 2: Determine the total number of unicorns in the world.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Import the appropriate libraries\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Step 2: Define the given information\nfemale_unicorns_scotland = 6  # The number of female unicorns in Scotland\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of Scottish unicorns.\n# Given that two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female, we can use arithmetic to find the total.\ntotal_unicorns_scotland = female_unicorns_scotland / (2/3)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total number of unicorns in the world.\n# With the information that a third of all unicorns are from Scotland, we use arithmetic to find the total.\ntotal_unicorns_world = total_unicorns_scotland / (1/3)\n\nprint(total_unicorns_world)\n```\n\nIf the output value matches the expected result, we have our answer."
