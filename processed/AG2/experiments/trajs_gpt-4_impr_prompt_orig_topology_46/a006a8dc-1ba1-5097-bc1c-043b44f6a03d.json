Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwenty kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of shells brought by the girl's group and then divide it by the number of girls in the group.\n\nThe problem statement says that the number of girls is equal to the number of boys. Since there are twenty kids in total and they're divided into two equal groups, this means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\nThe number of shells brought by the boys is 60 each, so the boys gathered a total of 60 * 10 = 600 shells.\n\nThe girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys. That means the girls brought back:\n\n```python\n# your code\n600 + 4.5 * 600\n```\n\nOnce we compute this number, we divide the result by the number of girls (10) to find the number of shells each girl brought back.\n\n```python\n# your code\n(600 + 4.5 * 600) / 10\n```"

This means that the total number of shells the girls brought back should be 600 + 4.5 * 600 = 3300 shells.\n\nAnd since the total number of girls is 10, this means each girl should have brought back 3300 / 10 = 330 shells.\n\nBoth our calculations and the problem statement match up, so the answer is correct.\n\nHence, the number of seashells brought by each girl is \boxed{330}."
