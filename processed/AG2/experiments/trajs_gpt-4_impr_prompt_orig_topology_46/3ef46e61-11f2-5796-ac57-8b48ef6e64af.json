Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. However, on Fridays, he spends an additional 2 hours at work due to high call volumes. How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday?"

      "content": "Thank you for providing the calculated values. \n\nLet's summarise:\n\n- Tim handles 4 calls per hour,\n- In a regular 6-hour working day, he manages 24 calls,\n- On Fridays, when he works an additional two hours, he handles 32 calls,\n- Altogether, throughout the five-day workweek, he handles 128 calls.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nTo verify these results, we can consider them in terms of time:\n\n- Each call takes Tim 15 minutes, so in one hour (60 minutes) he can handle 60/15 = 4 calls.\n- In one regular day of 6 hours, he handles 6*4 = 24 calls.\n- On Friday, he works for 2 extra hours, so he handles an additional 2*4 = 8 calls, thus in total, 24 + 8 = 32 calls.\n- In the five-day workweek, he handles 4 days * 24 calls/day + 32 calls on Friday = 96 (from regular days) + 32 (Friday) = 128 calls.\n\nThe calculations provided matched this reasoning and the logic used to reach them. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{128}. Tim handles 128 calls during his five-day workweek."
