Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon. An app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon if you fill up at this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, and they have a coupon that offers a 10% discount on the total price after cashback, how much will they pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon?"

      "content": "The key to solve this problem is to follow appropriate operations between the price per gallon, number of gallons, cashback given per gallon and the coupon discount given. \n\nLet's follow these steps:\n1. Multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons to calculate the original total price.\n2. Multiply the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons to calculate the total cashback.\n3. Subtract the total cashback from the original total price to get the discounted price.\n4. Multiply the discounted price by the coupon discount to calculate the final price after discount.\n\nEach of these sub-problems can be easily solved using Python programming.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n# Step 1: Calculate the original total price\nprice_per_gallon = 3.00\nnum_gallons = 10\noriginal_price = price_per_gallon * num_gallons\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the cashback\ncashback_per_gallon = 0.20\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * num_gallons\n\n# Step 3: Subtract the cashback from the original price\ndiscounted_price = original_price - total_cashback\n\n# Step 4: Apply the coupon\ncoupon_discount = 0.10  # 10% expressed as a decimal\nfinal_price = discounted_price * (1 - coupon_discount)  # Subtracting the discount=% from 1.\n\nfinal_price\n```\n\nThis should give us the final price after applying the cashback and the coupon. We then will make sure to verify the solution before providing the final answer."

After applying the cashback amount and the coupon, the total amount payable for the gas is $25.20. \n\nSo the final answer is \boxed{25.20}. \n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nLet's verify the result by walking through each step of the calculation:\n\n1. We initially have 10 gallons for which the gas station charges $3 per gallon, giving a total cost of $30 (10 * $3).\n\n2. The cashback app provides a rebate of $0.20 per gallon, totaling $2 (10 * $0.20).\n\n3. Subtracting the cashback amount from the original cost gives a new price: $28 or $30 - $2.\n\n4. Finally, we apply a 10% coupon to this $28 to find our final cost, which is $25.20 ($28 - ($28 * 0.10)).\n\nAs we see, the verification process confirms our final answer."
