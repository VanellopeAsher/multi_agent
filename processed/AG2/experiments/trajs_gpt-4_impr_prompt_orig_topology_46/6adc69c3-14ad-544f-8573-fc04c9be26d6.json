Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. Each final is cut into 5 cm. How long is the ribbon?"

The given facts indicate that the ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts initially, each of which is further divided into 5 equal parts. Each of these is finally cut into 5 cm pieces. Therefore, we may imply that the length of the ribbon is computed as follows:\n\nentire_length = 4 * 5 * 5 \n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python. \n\n```python\n# Python code\ntotal_length = 4 * 5 * 5\nprint(\"The length of the ribbon is\", total_length, \"cm\")\n```\nImplement this in your Python environment and provide the output here."

Re-read the problem statement: Our result must be the total length of the ribbon in centimeters before any pieces are cut.\n2. Verify the calculations: The length of the initial parts is 4*5 cm = 20 cm. Each of those is divided into 5 parts, so we have 20 cm * 5 = 100 cm.\n3. Ensure that only the correct numeric answer is in the box. The result is given in centimeters, just as the problem statement wants. \n4. No information appears to be overlooked based on the problem statement.\n5. The answer seems reasonable and it satisfies all problem conditions.\n\nSo, the final answer is \boxed{100}."
