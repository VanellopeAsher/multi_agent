Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery packet of graham crackers can be used to create the base for 8 big smores. A box contains 3 such packets. If there are 9 children each desiring 2 smores and 6 adults each wanting 1 smore, how many boxes of graham crackers would be necessary?"

Figure out how many smores a box of graham crackers can provide (each box contains 3 packets).\n3. Divide the total smores needed by the number of smores a box of graham crackers can provide, rounding up, if necessary.\n\nLet's start by importing the necessary python libraries. \n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sympy\n```\n\nFirstly, we calculate the total number of smores needed:\n\n```python\ntotal_smores = 9 * 2 + 6 * 1\n```\n\nThen, we calculate the number of smores a box can provide:\n\n```python\nsmores_per_box = 3 * 8\n```\n\nFinally, we find the number of boxes required:\n\n```python\nboxes_required = sympy.ceiling(total_smores / smores_per_box)\n```\n\nLet's proceed with the above steps to find out how many boxes of graham crackers would be necessary."

This is correct.\n- Check calculation of smores per box. 3 packets/box * 8 smores/packet = 24 smores/box. This is also correct.\n- Check calculation of number of boxes. total smores needed / smores per box = 24 / 24 = 1. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this gives us 1 box.
