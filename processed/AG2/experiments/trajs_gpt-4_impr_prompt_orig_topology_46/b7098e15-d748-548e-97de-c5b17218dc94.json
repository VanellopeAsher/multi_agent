  "problem": "Billy is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days, how many people does he help? After helping people, Billy also decides to take a 15-minute break every hour to drink a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine. He also spends 30 minutes each day to organize his paperwork.  (Remember there are 31 days in March.)",

      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

Over 40 days, this amounts to 90 hours. In each of these working hours, he drinks a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine, totaling 11400 milligrams over the working period.\n4) Given that Billy helps two people per hour of work, he can assist a total of 180 people. \n\nSince these steps line up logically and mathematically, we are confident in our answers.\n\nBilly helps \boxed{180} people and drinks a total of \boxed{11400.0} milligrams of caffeine."
