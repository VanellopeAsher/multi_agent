Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. If they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that amount on Friday, how many chimichangas do they make on Tuesday?"

      "content": "The problem can be solved using a simple algebraic equation.\n\nLet x be the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday. Since the same amount is made on Wednesday, the number on Wednesday is also x. Since twice the amount of Tuesday's chimichangas are made on Friday, the number of chimichangas on Friday is 2x.\n\nThe total amount of chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is given to be 500. So, the equation that we can form from this data will be:\n\nx + x + 2x = 500\n\nLet's solve this equation to find the value of x."

We have found that the shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.\n\nSo, on Tuesday there will be 125 chimichangas.\nOn Wednesday, there will be the same amount as Tuesday i.e., 125 chimichangas.\nOn Friday, there will be twice the amount of Tuesday i.e., 2*125 = 250 chimichangas.\n\nAdding up all these, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday will be 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 chimichangas, which matches with the information given in the problem statement. Therefore, we can confidently say that our answer is correct."
