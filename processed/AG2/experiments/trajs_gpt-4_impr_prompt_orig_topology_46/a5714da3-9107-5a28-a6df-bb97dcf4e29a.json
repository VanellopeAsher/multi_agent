Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.  At the pet store, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each and 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece.  She bought 20 fish and she needed fish food that cost $2.00.  How much did she spend?"

Check all input values:\n   - The price of the aquarium is $10.00.\n   - 2 bags of rocks cost $2.50 each, so $2.50 x 2 = $5.00.\n   - 3 pieces of coral cost $2.00 each, so $2.00 x 3 = $6.00.\n   - The fish food cost $2.00.\n2. Check the calculation for total price:\n   - The sum of all these individual costs is $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $2.00    (fish food) = $23.00.\n   \nThe total price Scarlett spent matches the output of the Python code, so the solution is correct.\n\nFinal Answer: Scarlett spent \\$23.00 in total, so the final answer is \\(boxed{23}\\)."

To reconfirm, Scarlett bought:\n\n- an aquarium for $10.00,\n- 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, the total cost for rocks is $2.50 * 2 = $5.00,\n- 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, the total cost or corals is $2.00 * 3 = $6.00,\n- and some fish food that cost $2.00.\n\nWhen you add up all these expenses, the total amount Scarlett spent is $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (corals) + $2.00 (fish food) = \\$23.00.\n\nHence, the total amount of money that Scarlett spent is \\boxed{23}."
