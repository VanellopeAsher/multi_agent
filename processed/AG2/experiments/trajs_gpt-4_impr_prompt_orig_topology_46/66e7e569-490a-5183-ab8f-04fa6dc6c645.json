Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "Verification Steps:\n1. Review the problem and the approach.\n   - This problem was simple: calculate how many hash browns can be made from a given number of potatoes, knowing the potato-to-hashbrown ratio (60:360 or 1:6).\n   - The python function correctly calculates the number of hash browns by multiplying the ratio of hashbrowns per potato by the number of desired potatoes.\n\n2. Cross verify with the given python code output.\n   - The python function outputs 5760.0, implying that one could potentially make 5760 hash browns from 960 potatoes. \n\n3. Finally, confirm the answer.\n   - The verification steps above confirm that the answer obtained is correct and fits the solution approach as well as the given problem scenario.\n\nTherefore, given that 60 potatoes are used to make 360 hash browns, with 960 potatoes, you could potentially make 5760 hash browns.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5760}"
