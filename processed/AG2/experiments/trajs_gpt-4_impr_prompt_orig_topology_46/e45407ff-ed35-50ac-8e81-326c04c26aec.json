Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  The alcohol content of cognac is 15% stronger than scotch.  How much does he spend on everything?"

      "content": "The problem statement provides the following data: \n\n1. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600, which implies that each bottle of scotch costs $60.\n2. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Given he bought 10 bottles of scotch, this means he bought 20 bottles of cognac.\n3. Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than each bottle of scotch. Given each scotch bottle costs $60, this implies that each bottle of cognac costs $90.\n\nTo calculate the total amount John spent, we add the cost of the scotch bottles to the cost of the cognac bottles. \n\nThe Python code below is a direct solution, calculating the total cost:\n```python\n# count and cost of scotch bottles\nscotch_bottles = 10\ncost_of_scotch = 60\n\n# count and cost of cognac bottles\ncognac_bottles = 2 * scotch_bottles\ncost_of_cognac = 1.5 * cost_of_scotch\n\n# total spent\ntotal_spent = scotch_bottles*cost_of_scotch + cognac_bottles*cost_of_cognac\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nThis solution does not involve complex equations nor does it require many steps, hence we can solve it directly using Python. Let's proceed with the verification process."

They fulfil my expectations, which were:\n\n- Scotch    = 10 bottles * $60 per bottle = $600 total\n- Cognac = 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800 total\n  \nThus, the total cost is $600 + $1800 = $2400, which matches the output you provided.\n\nHence, the final answer is as follows:\n\nJohn spent a total of $2400 on both scotch and cognac.\n\nIn the format as requested, that is: \\boxed{2400}."
