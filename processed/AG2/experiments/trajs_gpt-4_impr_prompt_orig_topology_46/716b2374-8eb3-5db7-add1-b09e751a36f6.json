Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim might have, which will be the sum of the existing clients and the potential clients.\n2. Next, let's compute the total expenses on bleach, which is the number of bottles of bleach needed per client (2) times the number of clients times the cost per bottle of bleach.\n3. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so let's calculate the total amount spent on cloths, which is total income minus profit minus total expenses on bleach.\n4. Finally, we can find the cost per pack of cloths by dividing the total amount spent on cloths by the total number of clients since each client requires one pack of cloths.\n\nLet's implement this in python:\n\n```python\n# total number of clients\ntotal_clients = 3 + 5 # 3 existing clients and 5 potential clients\n\n# total expenses on bleach\nexpenses_on_bleach = 2 * total_clients * 2 # 2 bottles of bleach per client, costing $2 each\n\n# total profit\ntotal_profit = 20\n\n# total income\ntotal_income = 92\n\n# total amount spent on cloths\ntotal_cost_of_cloths = total_income - total_profit - expenses_on_bleach\n\n# cost per pack of cloths\ncost_per_cloth = total_cost_of_cloths / total_clients\n\nprint(cost_per_cloth)\n```"

      "content": "Verification Steps:\n\n1. We start by calculating the total number of clients Kim has, which is 3(existing clients) + 5(potential clients) = 8 clients.\n2. Next, we calculate the total expenses Kim incurs on bleach. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and Kim charges his clients $2 for each bottle of bleach. Therefore, the total expense on bleach is 2 bottles/client * 8 clients * $2/bottle = $32.\n3. Kim's profit is given as $20.\n4. Kim's total income is given as $92.\n5. Hence, taking into account Kim's total income and subtracting the total cost of bleach and the profit made, we get the total cost Kim incurs on cloths. This comes to $92 - $32 - $20 = $40.\n6. Since each client gets a pack of cloths, we divide the total cost of cloths by the total number of clients to get the cost of each pack of cloths, i.e., $40/8 = $5.\n\nWe performed each of the above steps during computation and the results were consistent with the expected results. Everything seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, the cost of each pack of cloths, is \\$5.\nSo, \\$\\boxed{5} is the final answer."
