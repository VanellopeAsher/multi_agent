You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.

The money from selling pictures, which is $70.\n2. Half of Ava's allowance, which is $90 / 2.\n3. The remaining amount Jayden still needs, which is $85.\n\nThe sum of these three parts is the total cost of the camera.\n\nWe can calculate it with Python directly. Let's finish it in the following Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# the money from selling pictures Jayden had\npictures_money = 70\n# the money Jayden's sister Ava gave him\nava_money = 90 / 2\n# the remaining money Jayden still needs\nremaining_money = 85\n\n# the total cost of the camera\ncamera_cost = pictures_money + ava_money + remaining_money\nprint(camera_cost)\n```"
