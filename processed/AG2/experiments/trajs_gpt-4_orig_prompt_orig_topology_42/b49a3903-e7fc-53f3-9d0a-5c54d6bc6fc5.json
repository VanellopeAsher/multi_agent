You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "Key Idea: As we know that the number of tulips that can fit in a row for each color, we can calculate the number of rows for each color's tulips. Then, add all rows together to get the total number of rows.\n\nCase 1:\n\nWe can solve this problem with python code. The number of rows for each color would be \n\n- the number of red tulips / tulips per row for red ones,\n- the number of blue tulips / tulips per row for blue ones, and \n- the number of yellow tulips / tulips per row for yellow ones using integer division (since a row won't be counted if there aren't enough flowers to fill it).\n\nThen, we just need to sum the number of rows for each color to get the answer.\n\n```python\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\nyellow_tulips = 30\nred_per_row = 6\nblue_per_row = 8\nyellow_per_row = 5\n\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_per_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_per_row\nyellow_rows = yellow_tulips // yellow_per_row\n\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```"
