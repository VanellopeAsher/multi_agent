You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Determine the number of passengers on the bus after the first stop.\n2. Determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.\n\nYou can calculate this using simple arithmetic operations in Python.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. To find out the number of passengers after the first stop, you subtract the number of passengers who got off from the total number of passengers, then add the number of passengers who got on the bus, and finally subtract the number of passengers who decided to get off again.\n\n2. Repeat similar calculations for the second stop. Deduct the number of passengers who got off and add the number of new passengers.\n\nLet's implement this in Python."
