You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.

Here are the equations we can extract from the problem:\n\nLet R represent the number of red squares, B represent the number of blue squares, G represent the number of green squares, and W represent the number of white squares.\n\n1. R = 14 (The comforter has 14 red squares)\n2. B = R + 4 (The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares)\n3. G = B + 6 (The comforter has 6 more green squares than blue squares)\n4. R + B + G + W = 68 (The total number of squares in the comforter is 68)\n5. W = 68 - G (The number of white squares is the total number of squares minus the number of green squares)\n\nWe can start by substituting equation 1 into equation 2 to find B, then substitute the value of B into equation 3 to find G. Next, substitute G into equation 5 to find W. Finally, find the difference between G and W for the answer.\n\nLet's do this with Python code."
