You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn 12 years, Charmaine will turn 16.

First we find out Charmaine's present age, and then from there we can calculate her age in four years.\n\nSince Charmaine will turn 16 after 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her present age. After that, we simply add 4 to her present age to find out her age after 4 years.\n\nHere is how we can do this with Python:\n\n```python\n# Finding out Charmaine's present age\ncharmaine_present_age = 16 - 12\n\n# Finding out Charmaine's age after 4 years\ncharmaine_future_age = charmaine_present_age + 4\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(charmaine_future_age)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we can get Charmaine's age after 4 years."
