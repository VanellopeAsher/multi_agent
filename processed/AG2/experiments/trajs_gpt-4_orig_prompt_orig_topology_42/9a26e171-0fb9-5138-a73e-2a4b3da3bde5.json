You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home.

We also know that 20 students do not possess a desktop, and this number represents one-fourth of the total number of students. \n\nFurther, it is given that this 20 is one-third of the students not having either a desktop or a laptop. This means that two-thirds of the students not having either a desktop or a laptop is equal to the number of students not having a laptop. \n\nWe will solve the problem step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: If 20 students represent one-fourth of the total students, find the total using the ratio.\nStep 2: If 20 students also represent one-third of students not having either a desktop or laptop, find the total number of students not having either of these systems.\nStep 3: Subtract the number of students having a desktop from the total students found in Step 1 to get the number of students not having a laptop.\n\nNow, let's transform these steps into Python code to solve for the total number of students."
