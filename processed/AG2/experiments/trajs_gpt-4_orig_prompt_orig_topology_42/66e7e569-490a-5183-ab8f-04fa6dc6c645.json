You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "Key Idea: We can solve this problem by extrapolating the known ratio of potatoes to hash browns.\n\nWe can set up the ratio as: \n60 potatoes = 360 hash browns.\nSo, 1 potato makes 360 / 60 = 6 hash browns.\nHence, 960 potatoes will make 960 * 6 hash browns.\n\nThe python code to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n```python\npotatoes = 960\nhash_browns_per_potato = 360 / 60\ntotal_hash_browns = potatoes * hash_browns_per_potato\nprint(total_hash_browns)\n```\nNow take out the query that would finish the problem. The query here is to calculate the result of the operation mentioned in the python code provided."
