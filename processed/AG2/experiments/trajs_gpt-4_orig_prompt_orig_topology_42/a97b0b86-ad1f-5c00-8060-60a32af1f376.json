You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

Then, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one pizza to find out how many pizzas Marie ordered.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\n# price for each item\nchicken_meal_price = 12\nmilk_price = 3.5\napple_price = 1.5\npizza_price = 8.5\n\n# quantity for each item\nchicken_meal_qty = 1\nmilk_qty = 5\napple_qty = 4\n\n# total amount paid\ntotal_paid = 52.5\n\n# calculate the total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples using formula: (price * qty)\ntotal_cost_without_pizza = (chicken_meal_price*chicken_meal_qty) + (milk_price*milk_qty) + (apple_price*apple_qty)\n\n# calculate the remaining cost by subtracting `total_cost_without_pizza` from `total_paid`\nremaining_cost = total_paid - total_cost_without_pizza\n\n# Calculate the number of pizza boxes ordered by dividing `remaining_cost` by `pizza_price`\npizza_qty = remaining_cost / pizza_price\n\nprint(pizza_qty)\n```\n\nYou can run the above Python program to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered."
