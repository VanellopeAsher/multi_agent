You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "The key to solve this problem is to set up an equation based on the information given in the problem. \n\nHere are the step by step processes:\n1. We know that on the first day, the nurses started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack, which means they had 19 + 50 = 69 bandages in total.\n2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, let's denote the amount of bandages they used on the first day by x, so on the second day, they used x - 10 bandages.\n3. On the third day, they ordered two more bulk packs, which means they added 2*50 = 100 bandages, and they used only half a pack, which means they used 50/2 = 25 bandages.\n4. According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\nWith these 4 steps, we can set up an equation:\n\n1st day bandages (69) - 1st day usage (x) + 2nd day bandages (50) - 2nd day usage (x - 10) + 3rd day bandages (100) - 3rd day usage (25) = 78 (final bandages left)\n\nLet's plug this into Python to solve for x, the amount of bandages they used on the first day."
