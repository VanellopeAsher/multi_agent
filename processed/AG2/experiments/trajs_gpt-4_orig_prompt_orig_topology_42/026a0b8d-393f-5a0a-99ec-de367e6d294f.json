She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

      "content": "The key idea to solve the problem is to set up an equation using the number of packets of seeds and their prices, then solve for the missing packet of seeds. The total cost scenario creates an equation in the form of Cost_of_timato_seeds*number_of_tomato_seed_packets + Cost_of_celery_seeds*number_of_celery_seed_packets = Total_cost. By implementing this equation, let's solve the problem.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Create variable symbols for the unknown, i.e., the number of tomato seed packets\nnum_tomato_packets = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up equation for using all the money to buy the seeds\nequation = Eq(40 * num_tomato_packets + 30 * 80, 3200)\n\n# Solve for the number of tomato seed packets\nsolution = solve(equation, num_tomato_packets)\n\n# Print out the solution\nprint(\"The number of tomato seed packets Mrs. Rylan bought is {}\".format(solution[0]))\n```"
