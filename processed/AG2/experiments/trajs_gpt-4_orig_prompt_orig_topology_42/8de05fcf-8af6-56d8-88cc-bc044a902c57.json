You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than she did on Monday.\n4. In total, she spent 104 hours writing articles from Monday through Wednesday.\n\nIn order to find out how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday, we will first need to determine how many articles she wrote each day, then do the division.\n\nThe problem can be described by the equations: \n1. Monday_Articles = 5\n2. Tuesday_Articles = Monday_Articles + 2/5*Monday_Articles\n3. Hours_Spent = (Monday_Articles + Tuesday_Articles + Wednesday_Articles) * 4\n4. Wednesday_Articles = (Hours_Spent - (Monday_Articles + Tuesday_Articles)*4) / 4\n5. Ratio = Wednesday_Articles / Tuesday_Articles\n\nThe problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\nLet's code it."
