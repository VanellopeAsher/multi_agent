You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to reason that if two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home, then it implies that one-third of students do not have desktop computers at home. Given that 30 students do not have desktop computers, these 30 students represent the one-third portion of the total students. Therefore, we can find the total number of students by calculating three times the number of students who do not have desktop computers.\n\nThe Python code can therefore be presented as follows:\n\n```python\n# your code\nno_desktop = 30\ntotal_students = 3 * no_desktop\nprint(total_students)\n```\n\nRun this code to find the total number of students at the grade level."
