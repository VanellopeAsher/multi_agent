You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?"

      "content": "From the wording of the problem, we can reason that John runs the same distance for three days and half that distance for the remaining two days. The distance he runs in a week can be expressed as 3x + 2x/2, where x is the distance he runs those three days. As we know that John runs 60 miles a week, we can set up a simple equation: 3x + 2x/2 = 60. We can solve this equation to find the value of x. \n\nLet's code this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the variable \nx = symbols('x')\n\n# setup the equation\nequation = Eq(3*x + 2*x/2, 60)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# output the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\nPlease run the code to get the result."
