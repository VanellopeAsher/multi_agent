You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

We need to calculate the total number of people Martha invited and then subtract the ones who couldn't make it due to sickness and other commitments.\n\nFollowing the rule of Case 1, we can solve this problem with Python code directly.\n\nPython Code:\n```python\ntotal_family_members = (12 * 6) + (15 * 4)\npeople_who_cant_come = 16 + (16/4)\npeople_who_come = total_family_members - people_who_cant_come\nprint(people_who_come)\n```\nIn this code, we first calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited, then calculate the total number of people who couldn't come. Finally, by subtracting the people who couldn't attend from the total number of invitees, we find out how many people actually show up at Martha's party."
