  "problem": "At the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces. The teacher agreed. Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she sold all her muffin crayons and made $36, how much each muffin crayon sells for?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

Once we have that number, we can find out how much each muffin crayon sells for by dividing the total amount she made from selling the muffin crayons by the number of muffin crayons.\n\nThis problem can be solved with Python code directly as mentioned in Case 1. Here is the Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total crayons Kate got\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# number of crayon pieces to make one muffin crayon\npieces_per_muffin = 8\n\n# total muffin crayons Kate made\ntotal_muffin_crayons = total_crayons // pieces_per_muffin\n\n# total amount Kate made from selling the muffin crayons\ntotal_amount = 36\n\n# price of each muffin crayon\nprice_per_muffin = Rational(total_amount, total_muffin_crayons)\n\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n\n```"
