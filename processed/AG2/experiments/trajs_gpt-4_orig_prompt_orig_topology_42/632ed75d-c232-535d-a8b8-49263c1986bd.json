  "problem": "There are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "Key Idea: The problem can be solved by using fractions to represent the ratios between the different flights, and solving a simple equation to find the total number of flights made by the first aircraft. \n\nSolution:\nSince the second aircraft's 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day, it means that the first aircraft makes 2*44=88 flights in total every day. The first aircraft evenly divides its flights that are not to Greece between France and Germany, meaning that each country receives half of 1/4, or 1/8, of the first aircraft's total flights.\n\nLet's calculate the number of flights to France using Python."
