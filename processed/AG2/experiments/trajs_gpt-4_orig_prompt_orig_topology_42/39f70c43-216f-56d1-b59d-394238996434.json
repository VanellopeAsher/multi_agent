You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarly wants to treat her friends.

The code was meant to explain in a Pythonic way how the problem would be solved if we knew the price of the fruit drinks. \n\nThe actual error we encountered is due to the variable 'x' and 'total_cost' not being defined. This is because we haven't assigned a value to 'x' (the price of each can of fruit drinks) because we were not provided with that information in the problem.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we can assign a hypothetical value to 'x'. For demonstration purposes, let's assume the price of each can of fruit drinks is $1. Here is how the code would look:\n\n```python\nx = 1   # Assume each can of fruit drinks costs $1\nfruit_drinks = 5 * x\ntotal_cost = total_without_drinks + fruit_drinks\nchange = 50 - total_cost\nprint(change)\n```\nPlease note that the result of this code is based on the assumption that each can of fruit drinks costs $1, which might not be the case.
