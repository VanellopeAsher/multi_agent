Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nWe first need to find out the total minimum payment per month for all the debts Jessica has. Then we calculate 50% more of this total minimum payment. Since she pays this amount every month, we calculate the total payment for one year by multiplying this monthly debt payment by 12.\n\nLet's denote the student loan, credit card, and mortgage minimum payments as S, C, and M respectively. The total minimum payment (P) then would be P = S+C+M. To find the new payment (p_new) with 50% increase on P, we use the following formula p_new= P + P*50/100.\n\nFinally, multiply p_new by 12 to get the total debt payment in a year (p_year). \n\nLet's solve the problem using Python code."
