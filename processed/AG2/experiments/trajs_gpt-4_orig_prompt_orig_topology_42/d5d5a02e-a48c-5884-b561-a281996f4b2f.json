You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

In 5 years, Emil will be half the age of his dad, which gives us the equation: E + 5 = 1/2 * (D + 5).\n2. In 5 years, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, which gives us the equation: E + 5 = 2 * (B + 5).\n  \nWe can solve for Emil using these equations, and then find the values of D and B from there. With the quantities D and B, we can calculate their sum.\n\nLet's put this into Python code."
