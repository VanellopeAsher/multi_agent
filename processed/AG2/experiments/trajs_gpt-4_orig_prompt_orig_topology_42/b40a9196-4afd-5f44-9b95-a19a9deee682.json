You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

Since only milk and eggs are considered as food items in this context, tax will be applied to light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.\n\nLet's use Python's sympy package to calculate this.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of all the items without the tax. Then, we calculate the tax for the non-food items and add it to the total cost.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Cost of each item\nmilk, eggs, light_bulbs, cups, roach_trap = 2, 3, 3, 3, 4\n\n# Total cost without tax\ntotal_cost = milk + eggs + light_bulbs + cups + roach_trap\n\n# Cost of non-food items\nnon_food_items_cost = light_bulbs + cups + roach_trap\n\n# Calculate the tax\ntax_rate = Rational(10, 100)\ntax = non_food_items_cost * tax_rate\n\n# Total cost including tax\ntotal_cost_with_tax = total_cost + tax\n\nprint(total_cost_with_tax)\n```"
