You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

Afterward, we should divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box of pizza to find out how many pizza boxes she ordered.\n\nHere is the Python code for this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Price of one chicken meal\nchicken_meal_price = 120\n\n# Price of one pack of milk and the number of packs ordered \nmilk_price = 30\nmilk_packs = 5\n\n# Price of one apple and the number of apples ordered\napple_price = 1.50\nnum_apples = 40\n\n# Total amount paid by Marie\ntotal_paid = 900\n\n# Price of one box of pizza\npizza_box_price = 57 \n\n# Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, packs of milk, and apples\ntotal_cost = chicken_meal_price + (milk_price * milk_packs) + (apple_price * num_apples)\n\n# Calculate the amount spent on pizza boxes\npizza_cost = total_paid - total_cost\n\n# Calculate the number of pizza boxes ordered\nnum_pizza_boxes = pizza_cost / pizza_box_price\n\nprint('Number of pizza boxes:', num_pizza_boxes)\n```\n\nYou can run this code to get the answer."
