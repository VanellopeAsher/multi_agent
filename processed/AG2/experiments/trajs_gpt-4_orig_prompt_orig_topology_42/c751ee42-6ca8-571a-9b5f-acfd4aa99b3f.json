You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn goes shopping and buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

Then we can add up the costs of all items, remembering to include the tax for non-food items.\n\nIn the given problem, milk, eggs, cookies, and a bottle of water are food items, whereas light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. \n\nSo the task is:\n1. Calculate the tax for non-food items, which is 10% of their total cost.\n2. Add up the costs of all items, remembering to include the tax for non-food items.\n\nWe can solve this problem using direct calculation in Python. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# cost of the items\nmilk_cost = 2\neggs_cost = 3\nlight_bulbs_cost = 3\ncups_cost = 3\nroach_traps_cost = 4\ncookies_cost = 2\nwater_cost = 1\n\n# total cost of non-food items\nnon_food_cost = light_bulbs_cost + cups_cost + roach_traps_cost \n\n# total cost of food items\nfood_cost = milk_cost + eggs_cost + cookies_cost + water_cost\n\n# calculating 10% tax on non-food items\ntax = (non_food_cost * Rational(10, 100))\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = (food_cost + non_food_cost + tax)\n\nprint(\"The total cost is\", total_cost)\n```\nLet's run this Python code and see the result."
