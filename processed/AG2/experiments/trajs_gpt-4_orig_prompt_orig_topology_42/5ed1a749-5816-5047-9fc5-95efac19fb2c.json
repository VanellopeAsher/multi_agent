You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.

Then the number of pieces in the second set is 3x, and in the third set it's 1/4x. Therefore, the total number of legos Johnny picks up is the sum of these three numbers.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')  # denote the number of pieces in the first set\ntotal_legos = Eq(x + 3*x + 1/4*x, x)  # total number of legos equation\nsolution = solve(total_legos, x)  # solve the equation\n\nprint(f\"The total number of legos Johnny picks up is: {solution[0]}\")\n```"

In fact, we don't have an equation to solve because we don't know the exact value of x, as no number of legos is given. Instead, we just need to express the total number of legos in terms of x.\n\nThe total number of legos Johnny picks up is x (from the first set) + 3x (from the second set) + 1/4x (from the third set).\n\nSo, let's modify our Python code to calculate the sum.\n\n```python\n# x represents the number of pieces in the first lego set\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# total number of legos Johnny picks up\ntotal_legos = x + 3*x + 1/4*x\n\nprint(f\"The total number of legos Johnny picks up is: {total_legos}\")\n```"
