  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

      "content": "Key idea: We can solve this problem by setting up an algebraic equation based on the information given.\nFirst, we calculate the total number of bleach bottles Kim needs each week. Then we calculate the total cost of bleach. After that, we calculate Kim's total expenses by subtracting the total profit from the total income. The cost of each pack of cloths can then be obtained by subtracting the total cost of bleach from total expenses and then dividing by the number of packs of cloths. Each client's home needs one pack of cloths, so the number of packs of cloths equals the number of clients. \n\nFollowing these steps, we can use Python to do the calculations."

One client requires 2 bottles of bleach, each bottle costs $2.\n\nKim's total expenses are his total income subtract his total profit, this will give us the total expenses.\n\nWe know Kim's expenses include the total cost of bleach and the cost of cloths. To get the total cost of cloths, we will subtract the total cost of bleach from Kim's total expenses.\n\nFinally, since each client needs one pack of cloths, we can calculate the cost of one pack of cloths by dividing the total cost of cloths by the total number of clients.\n\nNow we can code these calculations. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the total number of clients\ntotal_clients = 3 + 5 \n\n# define the total cost of bleach\ncost_of_bleach = 2 # dollars\ntotal_bleach = total_clients * 2 # two bottles for each client\ntotal_cost_bleach = total_bleach * cost_of_bleach\n\n# define Kim's income and profit\nincome = 92 # dollars\nprofit = 20 # dollars\n\n# calculate Kim's total expenses\nexpenses = income - profit\n\n# calculate the total cost of cloths\ntotal_cost_cloths = expenses - total_cost_bleach\n\n# calculate the cost of one pack of cloths\ncost_cloths = total_cost_cloths / total_clients\n\n# print the result\nprint('The cost of each pack of cloths is', cost_cloths)\n```\nNow let us see what the code returns."
