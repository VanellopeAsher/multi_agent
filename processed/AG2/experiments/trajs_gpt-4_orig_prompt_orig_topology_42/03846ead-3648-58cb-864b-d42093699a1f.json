  "problem": "Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a field trip. In the class, there are Alex, Mary, Bella, and Tim. Alex has collected 60 points. Bella outperformed Alex and collected 30% more. Mary managed to collect 3 times more points than Tim, who has 40 points less than Bella.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStudents in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior.

The number of points Alex, Bella, Mary, and Tim collected is known. We can add these together to calculate the total number of points. Then we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold to get the lacking points.\n\nPython code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define points using obtained information\nalex_points = 60\nbella_points = alex_points + 0.3 * alex_points\ntim_points = bella_points - 40\nmary_points = 3 * tim_points\n\n# Calculate total points\ntotal_points = alex_points + bella_points + tim_points + mary_points\n\n# Calculate lacking points\nlacking_points = 500 - total_points\n\n# Wrap it into a print function for the final output\nprint(lacking_points)\n```"
