You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nLeah just got a new kitten.

The total cost of vaccines is 3 times the cost of each vaccine, and then reducing the total cost of vaccines by 10% because of the discount. The cost of the vases is simply 4 times the cost of each vase. \n\nWe can code this logic in Python to get the total cost.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# cost of spaying\nspaying_cost = 200\n\n# cost of vaccines before discount\ntotal_vaccine_cost_before_discount = 3 * 20\n\n# applying 10% discount on vaccines\ntotal_vaccine_cost = total_vaccine_cost_before_discount * (1 - 10 / 100)\n\n# cost of vases broken by kitten\nvase_cost = 4 * 12\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = spaying_cost + total_vaccine_cost + vase_cost\n\n# print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```"
