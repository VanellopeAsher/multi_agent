You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSamwell owns an appliance store.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is to understand that the number of TVs sold across all types should sum up to the total number of TVs sold. This is a simple arithmetic problem that we can solve using Python. We know the total number of televisions sold and the fraction of televisions of each type, so we just need to subtract the sum of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs from the total which will give us the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nThe problem can be solved by the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs sold, as we have the total number and percentage of TVs sold.\n2. Subtract from the total number of TVs sold.\n\nWe can perform these calculations directly through Python. Here is the code to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total number of TVs sold\ntotal_tvs = 40\n\n# calculate number of each type of TVs sold\nsmart_tvs = total_tvs / 4\nanalog_tvs = total_tvs / 8\nprojection_tvs = total_tvs / 5\n\n# calculate the number of OLED TVs by subtracting the sum of other TVs from total TVs\noled_tvs = total_tvs - smart_tvs - analog_tvs - projection_tvs\n\nprint(f\"The number of OLED TVs sold is {oled_tvs}\")\n```\nThis code first calculates the number of each type of TVs sold, and then it subtracts the sum from the total number of TVs, resulting in the number of OLED TVs. Note that we do not need to worry about fractional TVs in the real world as the number of TVs sold must be an integer."
