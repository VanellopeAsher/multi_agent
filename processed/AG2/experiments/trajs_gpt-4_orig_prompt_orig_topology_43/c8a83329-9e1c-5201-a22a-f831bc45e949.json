You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.

Then figure out how many she gave away.\n3. Then take into account the number she received.\n4. Finally, subtract the number of cards given away from the total cards and add the number of cards received to find how many Valentine's cards Erica now has.\n\nThis problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\n```python\n# Define the nubmer of cards Erica initially made\ninitial_made_cards = 20\n\n# Define the nubmer of cards each box from Erica's dad contains and the number of boxes\ncards_per_box = 20 # making assumption about the number of cards per box since it's not given in the problem\nnumber_of_boxes = 2\nbought_cards = cards_per_box * number_of_boxes\n\n# Calculate the total cards Erica starts with\ntotal_start_cards = initial_made_cards + bought_cards\n\n# Define the number of cards Erica gave her classmates and family\nclassmates_cards = 24\nfamily_given_cards = 5\n\n# Calculate the total cards Erica gave away\ntotal_given_cards = classmates_cards + family_given_cards\n\n# Define the number of cards Erica received\nreceived_cards = 17\n\n# Calculate the total cards Erica has after giving and receiving\ntotal_cards_now = total_start_cards - total_given_cards + received_cards\n\nprint(total_cards_now)\n```\n\nAdjust cards_per_box according to the actual number of cards in each box."
