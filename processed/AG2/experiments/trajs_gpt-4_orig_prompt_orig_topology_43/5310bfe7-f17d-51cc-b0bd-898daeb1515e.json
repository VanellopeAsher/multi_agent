You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend.

Similarly, since Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna, Anna's score can be expressed as \"Richie's score - 55\". \n\nWe then add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna to get the total goals. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define Richie's score\nRichie = 90\n\n# Define Mark's Score\nMark = Richie - 30\n\n# Define Anna's Score\nAnna = Richie - 55\n\n# Calculate total score\ntotal_score = Richie + Mark + Anna\n\nprint(total_score)\n```\nThe code above will calculate the total goals scored by the three teenagers."
