You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.

C = 2D - 5\n2. D = 3S + 4\n\nWe already know that C = 45, so 45 = 2D - 5 can be used to find D, then we can put D into the second equation to find S.\n\nThe problem can be solved by Python code, therefore falls into Case 1. We can use sympy to solve the linear equation system.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nD, S = symbols('D S')\n\n# equations\neq1 = Eq(45, 2*D - 5)\neq2 = Eq(D, 3*S + 4)\n\n# solve for D\nD_val = solve(eq1, D)[0]\n\n# substitute D value into the 2nd equation then solve for S\nS_val = solve(Eq(D_val, 3*S + 4), S)[0]\n\nprint(\"The age of the son is\", S_val)\n```"
