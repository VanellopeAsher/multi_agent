You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBenny saw a shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it.

      "content": "Key Idea: The shark's body length is ten times the combined length of the remoras, so the combined length of the two 6-inch remoras equals 10% of the shark's body length. Therefore, we just need to compute the total length of the remoras and figure out what number is ten times this amount.\n\n```python\n# length of one remora\nlength_single_remora = 6  # in inches\n\n# length of two remoras\ntotal_length_remoras = 2 * length_single_remora\n\n# compute length of shark\nlength_shark = total_length_remoras * 10\nprint(length_shark)\n```\n\nWe multiply the length of a single remora by two to get the total length of both remoras. Afterwards, we multiply this total by 10 because the length of the shark is ten times the length of the remoras."
