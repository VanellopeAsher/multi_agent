  "problem": "Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $2000, regardless of how many guests attend. While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.

      "content": "Given that the first venue charges a flat fee of $2000 and it will cost an additional $50 per person for food. The total cost at the first venue will be 2000 + 50 * number_of_guests which is a linear function of the number of guests.\n\nThe second venue charges $250 per person, therefore the cost will be 250 * number_of_guests, which is also a linear function of the number of guests.\n\nTo find the number of guests that makes the two venues cost the same, we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for the number_of_guests:\n\n2000 + 50 * number_of_guests = 250 * number_of_guests\nThis is a simple algebraic equation which Python can solve directly. \n\nHere is how that can be programmed in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nnumber_of_guests = symbols('x')\neq = Eq(2000 + 50 * number_of_guests, 250 * number_of_guests)\nsolution = solve(eq, number_of_guests)\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nDo you want me to run this Python code for you?
