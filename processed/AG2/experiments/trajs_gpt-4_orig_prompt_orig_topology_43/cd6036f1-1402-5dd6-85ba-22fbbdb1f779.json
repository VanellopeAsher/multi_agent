You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month.

Next, we calculate the total weight he gained during his recovery period which is the product of the number of months of his recovery and the rate of weight gain per month. Finally, we add these two results together with his final weight to obtain his initial weight.\n\nWe can solve the problem directly with Python:\n\n```python\n# initial_weight = final_weight + weight_lost - weight_gained\nweight_lost = 3 * 10\nweight_gained = 2 * 5\nfinal_weight = 70\n\ninitial_weight = final_weight + weight_lost - weight_gained\nprint(initial_weight)\n```"
