You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Since we are assuming an unknown number of packs, the code mentioned earlier doesn't provide any output as it's waiting for a real number to replace `p`.\n\nIf we have the number of packs say `p = 5`, then we can substitute this into our equations and find the number of balloons that were thrown:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\np = 5  # Let's assume 5 packs\n\nb_single_pack = 30\nb_left = 12\n\nb_total = p * b_single_pack\nb_thrown = b_total - b_left\nprint(b_thrown)\n``` \n\nPlease replace the `p` in our original code with the actual number of packs filled to get your answer.
