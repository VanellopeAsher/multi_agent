You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each.

We then calculate the cost of the pencil case which is twice the sum of the cost of one notebook and two ballpens. Finally, we sum up all the costs to get the total amount that William spent.\n\nNow I will translate this into Python code which will perform all the necessary calculations. We can use sympy package to display results in a more human-readable format.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Cost of each item\nnotebook_cost = 1.5\nballpen_cost = 0.5\n\n# Number of items bought\nnum_notebooks = 5\nnum_ballpens = 1\n\n# Total cost for notebooks and ballpens\nnotebooks_total = notebook_cost * num_notebooks\nballpen_total = ballpen_cost * num_ballpens\n\n# Cost of pencil case (twice the cost of one notebook and two ballpens)\npencil_case_cost = 2 * (notebook_cost + 2 * ballpen_cost)\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = sp.Add(notebooks_total, ballpen_total, pencil_case_cost)\n\ntotal_cost\n```"
