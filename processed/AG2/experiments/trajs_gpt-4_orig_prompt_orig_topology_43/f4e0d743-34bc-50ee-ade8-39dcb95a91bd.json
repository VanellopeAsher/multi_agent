You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

Dog food: $25 per week, considering 4 weeks per month and 12 months in a year.\n2. Dog treats: $20 per month, and there are 12 months in a year.\n3. Dog medicine: $100 per month, and there are 12 months in a year.\n4. Dog shampoo: $15 per month, and there are 12 months in a year.\n5. Dog toy: $10 every two months, hence 6 times in a year since there are 12 months in a year.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n\n```python\n# weekly cost of food for 1 month is $25/week * 4 weeks\nmonthly_food_cost = 25 * 4\n# yearly cost of food is monthly cost * 12\nyearly_food_cost = monthly_food_cost * 12\n\n# yearly cost of treats is $20/month * 12\nyearly_treats_cost = 20 * 12\n\n# yearly cost of medicine is $100/month * 12\nyearly_medicine_cost = 100 * 12\n\n# yearly cost of shampoo is $15/month * 12\nyearly_shampoo_cost = 15 * 12\n\n# yearly cost of toy is $10 every two months i.e., $10 * 6\nyearly_toy_cost = 10 * 6\n\n# total yearly cost\ntotal_yearly_cost = yearly_food_cost + yearly_treats_cost + yearly_medicine_cost + yearly_shampoo_cost + yearly_toy_cost\n\nprint(total_yearly_cost)\n```"
