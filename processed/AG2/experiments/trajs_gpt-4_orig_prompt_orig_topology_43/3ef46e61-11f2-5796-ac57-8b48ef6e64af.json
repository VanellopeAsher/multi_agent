However, on Fridays, he spends an additional 2 hours at work due to high call volumes. How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

We'll first calculate how many calls Tim can handle in one hour, then calculate how many calls he deals with in a day. We know that he works longer on Friday, so we will add two extra hours for that day. Finally, we can multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by 5 days to get the total number of calls for the week.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the time spent per call and total time worked per day\ntime_per_call = Rational(15, 60) # 15 minutes per call in hours\nwork_hours_per_day = 6 # 6 hours per day\n\n# Calculate how many calls Tim can handle in one hour\ncalls_per_hour = 1 / time_per_call \n# Calculate how many calls Tim can handle in a day\ncalls_per_day = work_hours_per_day * calls_per_hour\n\n# Add 2 extra work hours for Friday\nwork_hours_on_friday = work_hours_per_day + 2\ncalls_on_friday = work_hours_on_friday * calls_per_hour\n\n# Subtract one normal day's calls and add Friday's calls to get the total calls for the week\ntotal_calls = 5 * calls_per_day - calls_per_day + calls_on_friday\n\nprint(total_calls)\n```"
