You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs.

Given that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs and the remainder of the eggs were found by their friends, we can setup a simple subtraction operation to calculate this.\n\nPython Code:\n\n```python\ntotal_eggs = 2 * 30  # The total amount of eggs the Smith twins found\nremaining_eggs = 10  # The leftover eggs\n\n# Number of eggs friends found\neggs_found_by_friends = total_eggs - remaining_eggs\n\nprint(\"The friends found\", eggs_found_by_friends, \"eggs.\")\n```\n\nRun this piece of code in Python environment to resolve the problem."
