You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIf Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 80 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?"

Then we set up an equation to solve for Sam's amount.\n\nSince the total feet of fence is the sum of Sam's and Harry's, we can set up this equation:\n\nSam's amount + Harry's amount = 200,\nwhere Harry's amount = Sam's amount + 80.\n\nThen we substitute Harry's amount in the equation and solve for Sam's amount which is the amount left over for Sam.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nsam, harry = symbols('sam harry')\n\n# Harry has 80 feet more than Sam\neq1 = Eq(harry, sam + 80)\n\n# They have 200 feet of fence between them\neq2 = Eq(sam + harry, 200)\n\n# Substitute eq1 into eq2\neq2_subs = eq2.subs(harry,eq1.rhs)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsam_amount = solve(eq2_subs, sam)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The amount of fence left over for Sam is\", sam_amount[0], \"feet\") \n```"
