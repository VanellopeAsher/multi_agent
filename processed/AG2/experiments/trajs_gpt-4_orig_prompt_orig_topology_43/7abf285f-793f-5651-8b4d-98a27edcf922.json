  "problem": "Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts and continues to pay the regular amount for her gym and Netflix, how much does she pay for her debts in a year?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.
