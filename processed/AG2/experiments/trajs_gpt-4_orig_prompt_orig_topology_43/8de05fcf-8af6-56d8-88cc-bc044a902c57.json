You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "Sure, let's proceed with solving the problem. \n\nFirst, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday based on the problem statement. \n\nSince she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday and we know that on Monday she wrote 5 articles. Let's find out:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variables\narticles_monday = 5\nmultiplier_tuesday = 1 + Rational(2,5)\n\n# calculate the number of articles on Tuesday\narticles_tuesday = articles_monday * multiplier_tuesday\nprint(articles_tuesday)\n```\n\nThen, let's calculate the total hours spent on Monday and Tuesday:\n\n```python\n# define the time spent per article\nhours_per_article = 4\n\n# calculate the total hours for Monday and Tuesday\ntotal_hours_monday = hours_per_article * articles_monday\ntotal_hours_tuesday = hours_per_article * articles_tuesday\ntotal_hours_monday_tuesday = total_hours_monday + total_hours_tuesday\nprint(total_hours_monday_tuesday)\n```\n\nAfter, let's calculate the number of hours Meredith spent writing on Wednesday:\n\n```python\n# define the total hours\ntotal_hours = 104\n\n# calculate the hours on Wednesday\nhours_wednesday = total_hours - total_hours_monday_tuesday\nprint(hours_wednesday)\n```\n\nNext, we'll find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday:\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of articles on Wednesday\narticles_wednesday = hours_wednesday / hours_per_article\nprint(articles_wednesday)\n```\n\nLastly, let's find out how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday:\n\n```python\ntimes_as_many = articles_wednesday / articles_tuesday\nprint(times_as_many)\n```"
