You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

This gives us a total of 169 bandages.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- The nurses used 10 fewer bandages on the second day than on the first day.\n- They used half a pack (which equals to 25 bandages) on the third day.\n- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\nUsing this information, we can set up the following equation:\n\n- First_day_bandages + (First_day_bandages - 10) + 25 = 169 - 78\n\nWe will use Python's sympy package to solve this equation for the variable First_day_bandages."

According to the equation, the total usage of bandages over these three days plus the leftover should be equal to the total number of bandages they have.\n\nThe equation is as follows:\n\n2 * First_day_bandages - 10 + 25 = 169 - 78\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python's `sympy` package.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nFirst_day_bandages = symbols('x')\neq = Eq(2 * First_day_bandages - 10 + 25, 169 - 78)\nsol = solve(eq, First_day_bandages)\nprint(\"The number of bandages used on the first day is\", sol[0])\n```\n\nThis code first imports the necessary methods from the sympy package. Then it creates a symbolic variable to represent the number of bandages used on the first day. Next, it creates an equation using the information from the problem and solves this equation for the variable `First_day_bandages`. Finally, it prints the result."
