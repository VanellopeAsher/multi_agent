You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom.

      "content": "Since we know that James delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 of this amount to Mr. Yu, we can write a Python program to compute the total number of messages delivered.\n\nKey idea: Use basic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication) to calculate the total number of messages delivered to both teachers.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_Thompson = 84 \n\n# Number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is 1/3 of that to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_Yu = Rational(1, 3) * messages_Thompson\n\n# Total messages delivered \ntotal_messages = messages_Thompson + messages_Yu\n\nprint(total_messages)\n```\n\nThe value printed by this program will represent the total number of messages delivered by James."
