  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nGiven the charges for each tire repair for trucks and cars, and the mechanic's earnings on both days, we can set up an equation to find the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n\nLet's denote the number of car tires repaired on Friday as x. \n\nWe can then formulate the equation considering the difference in total earnings over the two days. Given that each truck tire repair costs $60 and each car tire repair costs $40, we can say that:\n\n60 * number_of_truck_tires + 40 * number_of_car_tires_on_Thursday = 40 * number_of_car_tires_on_Friday + $40\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n60 * 6 + 40 * 4 = 40 * x + 40\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the value of x (number of car tires repaired on Friday)."
