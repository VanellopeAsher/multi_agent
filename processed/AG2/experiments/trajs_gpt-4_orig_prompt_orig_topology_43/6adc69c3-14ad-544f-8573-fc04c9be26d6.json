You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

      "content": "Since the ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts first and each of the cut parts is further divided into 5 equal parts, we multiply 4 and 5 to get 20 pieces. Each of these pieces is 5 cm long. Therefore, we can calculate the total length of the ribbon by multiplying the number of pieces by the length of each piece.\n\nHere is the Python code that calculates the length:\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the length of the ribbon\nnumber_of_pieces = 4 * 5\nlength_each_piece = 5 # in centimeters\nlength_of_ribbon = number_of_pieces * length_each_piece\n\nprint(length_of_ribbon)\n# This will give the length of the ribbon in centimeters\n```"
