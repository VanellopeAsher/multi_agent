You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Monday, a water tank measured 17 feet deep.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is sequentially calculating the changes in the water level of the tank. First, calculate the depth on Tuesday by adding 7 feet to Monday's depth. Then, calculate the depth on Wednesday by multiplying Tuesday's depth with two thirds.\n\nStep by step, this looks as follows:\n- Calculate the depth on Tuesday: 17 feet (Monday's depth) + 7 feet = ? feet\n- Calculate the depth on Wednesday: ? feet (Tuesday's depth) * 2/3 = ? feet\n\nUse Python to execute these calculations:\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Depth on Monday\nmonday_depth = 17\n\n# Additional depth on Tuesday\nadditional_depth = 7\n\n# Tuesday's depth\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + additional_depth\n\n# Waters on Wednesday is two-thirds of Tuesday's depth\nwednesday_depth = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_depth\n\n# Display the waters' depth on Wednesday\nprint(f'The depth of water on Wednesday: {wednesday_depth} feet')\n```\n\nNote that we use sympy to perform symbolic computation and to keep the fractions instead of converting them to decimals."
