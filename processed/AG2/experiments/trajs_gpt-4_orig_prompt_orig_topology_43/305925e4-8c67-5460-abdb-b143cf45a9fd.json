You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Let's denote Joey's new score as `new_score`.\n2. From the problem, it is known that Joey scored some points, then Marcy scored 10 points. We don't know exactly how many points Joey scored. But we know that after both Joey's and Marcy's turns, Joey is winning. So, Joey's new score (`new_score`) is greater than Marcy's score after she scored 10 points (225 + 10 = 235).\n3. We need to find the difference between Joey's new score (`new_score`) and Marcy's new score (235). This difference will tell us by how many points Joey is now winning.\n\nNow, we'll need the value of `new_score`. Please provide it."
