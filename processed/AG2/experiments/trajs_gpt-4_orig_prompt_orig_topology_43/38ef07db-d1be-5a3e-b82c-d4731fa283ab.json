You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party.

      "content": "Key Idea: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, as the crepe paper will be hung around the fence, which is in the shape of a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width).\n\nThe lengths of the sides of his rectangular fence are 20.5 feet (length) and 15.5 feet (width). We can use these values to calculate the total amount of crepe paper James needs to buy.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# dimensions of the rectangular backyard fence\nlength = sp.Rational(205, 10)  # 20.5 feet\nwidth = sp.Rational(155, 10)  # 15.5 feet\n\n# calculation for total length of crepe paper \n# needed (equal to the perimeter of the rectangle)\ntotal_crepe_paper = 2*(length + width)\n\nprint(total_crepe_paper)\n```"
