You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein.

      "content": "This problem can be solved directly with Python code.\n\nHere are the steps we can follow:\n  1. Calculate how much grams of protein from the mushrooms John eats in one day.\n  2. Then, multiply that by 7 to get how much grams of protein from the mushrooms he eats in a week.\n\nWe can use `sympy` to do the calculations. From the problem, we already know that 150 grams of mushrooms give 4 grams of protein. We can set up a proportion to find out how many grams of protein 300 grams of mushrooms will give. We then multiply this by 7 to find the total grams of protein consumed in a week.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the quantities we know\nprotein_150g = 4  # 4 grams protein in 150 grams of mushrooms\nmushroom_weight_daily = 300  # John eats 300 grams of mushrooms daily\n\n# calculate the amount of protein in 300g of mushrooms\nprotein_300g = mushroom_weight_daily * (protein_150g / 150)\n\n# calculate total grams of protein consumed in a week\nprotein_weekly = protein_300g * 7\nprint(protein_weekly)\n```"
