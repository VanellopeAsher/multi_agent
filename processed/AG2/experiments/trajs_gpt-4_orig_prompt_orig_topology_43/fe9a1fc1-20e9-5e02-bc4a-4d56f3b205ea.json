You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKatarina has 5 less cookies than Max has.

Since Katarina has 6.8 times ten cookies which equals 68 cookies, we can find out that Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.\n\nThen, as it is stated in the problem, Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can calculate how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. which is (73 / 1.2) - 10 cookies.\n\nFinally, we know Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, that is 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.\n\nAdding all the cookies together will give the total number of cookies:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# cookies for each character\nkatarina_cookies = 6.8 * 10\nmax_cookies = katarina_cookies + 5\nmonster_cookies = (max_cookies / 1.2) - 10\nsummer_cookies = max_cookies + 23\n\n# total cookies\ntotal_cookies = sp.Add(katarina_cookies, max_cookies, monster_cookies, summer_cookies)\nprint(total_cookies)\n```"
