  "problem": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

      "content": "The key to this problem is to calculate the total cost of the groceries in Kelly's cart and then subtract it from her budget. \n\nThe problem provides the cost of one type of item and relates it with the cost of other items. After we find the unit cost for each type of item, we can multiply it with the quantity of each item in Kelly's cart to find the total cost.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n1. Find the single cost of a pack of bacon by dividing the total cost by the number of bacon packs.\n2. Use this to calculate the cost of a single packet of chicken (since it's twice the cost of a pack of bacon).\n3. Multiply the cost of a single pack of strawberries by the total number of packs to get the total cost.\n4. Find the cost of a single pack of apples (since it's half the cost of a pack of strawberries) and multiply it by the total number of packets to get the total cost.\n5. Add up the total cost of all items in the cart.\n6. Subtract the total cost from Kelly’s budget to get the leftover budget.\n\nLet's write the code based on the steps outlined."
