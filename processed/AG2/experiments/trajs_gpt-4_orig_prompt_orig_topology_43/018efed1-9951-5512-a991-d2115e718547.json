You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.

To figure out the amount spent, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and subtract from it the amount Gerald was able to save. \n\nThe following Python code will carry out the needed calculation.\n\n```python\n# calculation of total earnings\ntotal_earnings = 30 * 7\n\n# calculation of amount spent\namount_spent = total_earnings - 110\nprint(amount_spent)\n```"
