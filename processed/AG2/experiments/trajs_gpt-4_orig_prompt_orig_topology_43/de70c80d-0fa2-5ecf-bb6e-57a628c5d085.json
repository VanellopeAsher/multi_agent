You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to first calculate the total from the first full writings and the half writings. Then, she rewrites everything she has already written, which means that the total number of letters she wrote is doubled.\n\nSince there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, Elise writes\n- 26 * 3 letters when she writes the alphabet three times\n- 26 * 0.5 letters when she writes half of it\n- which is then doubled when she rewrites everything\n\nWe can write a Python code to calculate the final answer. \n\n```python\n# Python code to solve the problem\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Number of letters in the alphabet\nletters_in_alphabet = 26\n\n# Number of times the full alphabet is written\nfull_writes = 3\n\n# Number of times half the alphabet is written\nhalf_writes = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of letters written before rewriting\nletters_before_rewriting = sp.Mul(sp.Add(sp.Mul(full_writes, letters_in_alphabet), sp.Mul(half_writes, sp.Rational(1,2), letters_in_alphabet)))\n\n# Total letters written = letters before rewriting *2\ntotal_letters_written = sp.Mul(letters_before_rewriting, 2)\n\nprint(total_letters_written)\n```\n\nThe output of the Python code will be the total number of letters that Elise has written."
