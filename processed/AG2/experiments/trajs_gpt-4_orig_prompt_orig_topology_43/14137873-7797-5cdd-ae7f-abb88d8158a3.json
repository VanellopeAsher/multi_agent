You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

This means that before the ants came, there were 6 french fries.\nSecondly, these 6 french fries are one third of the fries before the raccoon pilfered two thirds of them. We can thus find out the number of fries before the raccoon came.\nThirdly, each of the three pigeons consumed three fries. We can find out the number of fries before the pigeons came by adding these fries.\nLastly, the seagull devoured half the quantity of french fries that Dave had consumed who ate 14 fries. By adding what the seagull devoured to what was there before the pigeons came, we can find out the initial number of fries. \n\nLet's use python to do these calculations."
