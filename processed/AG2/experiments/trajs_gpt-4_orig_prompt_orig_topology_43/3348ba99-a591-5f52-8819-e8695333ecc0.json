You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark took a test yesterday that consisted of 7.5 sets of ten questions.

      "content": "The key idea to solve the problem is to calculate the total required time for each test based on the amount of questions and his speed of completing them, and then compare this to the actual time he had to complete the questions. We can calculate the total sets which Mark didn't complete by substracting the completed sets from total sets.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1. Calculate the total time needed to complete each test with the given rate.\n2. Calculate how many sets of ten questions Mark was able to complete in the actual time he had.\n3. Subtract the completed sets from the total sets to find how many sets he left incomplete.\n\nLet's break this down into Python code for the calculations."
