You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJolene and her friends are celebrating the start of summer with a water balloon battle.

Then we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the day.\n\nHere is the Python code with sympy to calculate it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variables\nsets_of_balloons = symbols('sets_of_balloons')\nballoons_per_set = symbols('balloons_per_set')\nballoons_left = symbols('balloons_left')\n\n# set the values\nsets_of_balloons = 10\nballoons_per_set = 30\nballoons_left = 12\n\n# calculate the total number of balloons prepared\ntotal_balloons_prepared = sets_of_balloons * balloons_per_set\n\n# calculate the number of balloons used\nballoons_used = total_balloons_prepared - balloons_left\n\n# print the result\nprint(balloons_used)\n```\n\nThis will give you the number of balloons used in their water balloon fight."
