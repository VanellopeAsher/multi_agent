You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.

He earns $30 every day and has worked for a week (7 days), so this gives us $30*7. He also babysit his neighbor's kids for 2 hours each day at a rate of $0 which doesn't add to his income.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the total expenses ($100) from the total income.\n\nLet me write a program to perform the calculations. \n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# income from working at the daycare\ndaycare_income_per_day = 30\ndays_worked = 7\ndaycare_total_income = daycare_income_per_day * days_worked\n\n# total expenses\nexpenses = 100\n\n# Calculate remaining money\nremaining_money = daycare_total_income - expenses\n\nprint(remaining_money)\n\n```"
