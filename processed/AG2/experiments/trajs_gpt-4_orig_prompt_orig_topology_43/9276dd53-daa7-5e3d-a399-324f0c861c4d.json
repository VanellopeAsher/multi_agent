You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there.

As per the problem, the ratio of the number of robots to helmets to footballs is 1:2:4, respectively.\n\nSince we have been given the number of helmets is 2000, we can apply the ratio to find the required number of robots and footballs. Then the total number of items can be calculated as the sum of the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.\n\nLet's translate this into Python code which will perform the calculations to solve the problem.\n\n```python\n# defining the number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n\n# finding the number of robots using the ratio\n# half as many robots as helmets\nrobots = helmets / 2\n\n# finding the number of footballs using the ratio\n# half as many helmets as footballs\nfootballs = 2 * helmets\n\n# calculating total items\ntotal_items = robots + helmets + footballs\n\n# printing the total number of items\nprint(total_items)\n```"
