You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nWe first calculate the total number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer, by multiplying 20 students by 3, because these 20 students only represent one-third of such students. Then, the number of students who do not have a desktop computer is one-fourth of the total number of students. Thus, we use cross-multiplication to calculate the total student amount.\n\nHere is the python code to solve it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of students without a desktop computer\ndesktop_absent = 20 * 3\n\n# the equation to solve\nx = symbols('x')\nequation = Eq(desktop_absent, x/4)\n\n# solving the equation\nnum_students = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\nprint(num_students)\n\n# confirm total students with desktop (3 quarters) plus without either (1 quarter) equals total students\nassert num_students * 3/4 + desktop_absent == num_students\n```"
