You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month.

Then, we will add up these two amounts to get the total amount paid for the year.\n\nLet's write Python code for this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the monthly charge and the number of months in a year\nmonthly_charge = 200\nmonths_in_a_year = 12\n\n# Calculate the amount paid for the first half of the year\nfirst_half_payment = monthly_charge * (months_in_a_year / 2)\n\n# Calculate the discounted monthly charge for the second half of the year\ndiscounted_monthly_charge = monthly_charge * (1 - 15/100)\n\n# Calculate the amount paid for the second half of the year\nsecond_half_payment = discounted_monthly_charge * (months_in_a_year / 2)\n\n# Calculate the total amount paid for the year\ntotal_payment = first_half_payment + second_half_payment\n\n# Print the total payment\nprint(\"The total amount Aleena paid for the year is:\", total_payment)\n```\n\nIn the end, the answer is the total amount Aleena paid for the year."
