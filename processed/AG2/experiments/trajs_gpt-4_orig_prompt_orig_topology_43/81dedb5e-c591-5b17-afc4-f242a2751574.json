You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

      "content": "Key Idea: Because the ribbon is being divided evenly, we can use division to calculate the length of each final piece.\n\nWe first divide the total length of the ribbon (let's call it \"ribbon_length\") by 4 because Marty is cutting it into 4 equal parts. We then divide each of these pieces by 5 because each 1/4 piece is being divided into 5 equal parts. So the final length of each cut piece can be represented by \"ribbon_length / 20\".\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# the ribbon length is unknown at this moment, so let's represent it by a symbol\nribbon_length = symbols('ribbon_length')\n\n# calculate length of each final piece\nfinal_piece_length = ribbon_length / 20\n\nfinal_piece_length\n```\n\nPlease input the value of \"ribbon_length\" so we can calculate the final length of each piece."
