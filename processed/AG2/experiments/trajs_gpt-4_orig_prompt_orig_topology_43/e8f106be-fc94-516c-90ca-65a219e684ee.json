His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. \n\nIn this case, he will need 2 lengths of crepe paper for the long sides (each of 20 feet) and 2 lengths of crepe paper for the short sides (each of 15 feet). We can add these lengths to find the total length of crepe paper required.\n\nLet's solve it with Python."
