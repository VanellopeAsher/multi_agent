You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAmora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 150 more corn chips than the number the others got.

      "content": "The key idea to solve the problem is to realize that two people, Amora and Lainey, each got 700 corn chips. The third person, Collins, got 150 more than what the others got, implying Collins got 700 + 150 = 850 corn chips. Therefore, to find the total amount of corn chips, we need to sum up the corn chips which Amora, Lainey, and Collins each got.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this.\n\n```python\n# Define the amount of chips Amora and Lainey got\nAmora_Lainey_chips = 700\n\n# Define the extra amount of chips Collins got\nCollins_extra_chips = 150\n\n# Calculate the total amount of chips\ntotal_chips = 2 * Amora_Lainey_chips + (Amora_Lainey_chips + Collins_extra_chips)\n\n# Print result\nprint(total_chips)\n```\nThis program will calculate and print the total number of corn chips."
