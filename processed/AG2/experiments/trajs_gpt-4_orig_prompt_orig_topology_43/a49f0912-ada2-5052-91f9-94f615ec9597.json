You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

Boating took 60 hours, swimming took half of that which is 30 hours. John watched 30 shows that were each 20 hours long, therefore this totals to 30 * 20 = 600 hours."

Then, we can solve for the total time spent.\n\nLet's continue with Python for this calculation. \n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# This will automatically enable the best printer available in your environment.\ninit_printing()\n\n# Let T be the total time\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# 690 is 30% of the total time\neq = Eq(690, 0.3*T)\n\ntotal_time = solve(eq, T)[0]\ntotal_time\n```"
