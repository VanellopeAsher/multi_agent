You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nWe need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeded $20. \n\nWe know the total cost for the course is $80 and the total number of classes is 12. Thus, the cost per class as long as he attends all classes is $80/12. \n\nWe need to find the number of classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $20. This can be done by gradually decreasing the number of attended classes (from total classes to zero) and calculating the cost per class each time (total cost divided by attended classes) until the cost exceeds $20. We return the number of missed classes for the last result before exceeding $20. \n\nFor efficiency, instead of step by step approach, we can use Python to go through all possible number of classes in one script.\n\nLet's write a script to solve this: \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\nnum_classes = 12\ntotal_cost = 80\nmissed_classes = symbols('x')\n\nequation = (total_cost / (num_classes - missed_classes)) - 20\nmissed_classes_solution = solve(equation)\n\nprint(\"Manny can miss up to\", missed_classes_solution[0], \"classes.\")\n```\n\nLet's run this to know how many classes Manny can miss."
