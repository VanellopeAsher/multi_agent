You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts.

The total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing is the sum of the service fee, the cost of labor (the hourly rate times the number of hours, rounded up because it's based on each hour or fraction of an hour), and the cost of parts.\n\nTo solve this using Python, we need to calculate the service fee, labor cost, and parts cost separately and then add them together.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sympy\n\n# Parameter initialization\nservice_fee = 40\nhourly_rate = 35\nparts_cost = 60\nhours_worked = sympy.Rational(225, 100)   # representing 2.25 as a fraction\n\n# Cost calculation\nlabor_cost = hourly_rate * math.ceil(hours_worked)   # the hourly rate times the number of hours, rounded up\ntotal_bill = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost   # summing up all costs\n\nprint(total_bill)\n```"
