She then purchased two packets of stones from a pet shop, each costing $2.50, and three coral pieces priced at $2.00 each. She also bought 20 fish, each priced at $0.50, and a packet of fish food for $2.00. What was the total amount Scarlett spent?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a garage sale, Scarlett discovered a fish tank priced at $10.00.

The costs include:\n\n1. Fish tank\n2. Packets of stones\n3. Coral pieces\n4. Fish\n5. Fish food\n\nSome of these items were purchased in quantities greater than one, so we will need to multiply the cost of a single item by the quantity purchased to find the total cost for those items before adding it all up.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Price of each item\nfish_tank_price = 10.00\nstone_packet_price = 2.50\ncoral_piece_price = 2.00\nfish_price = 0.50\nfish_food_price = 2.00\n\n# Quantity of each item\nstone_packet_qty = 2\ncoral_piece_qty = 3\nfish_qty = 20\n\n# Calculate total price\nfish_tank_total = fish_tank_price\nstone_packet_total = sp.Mul(stone_packet_price, stone_packet_qty)\ncoral_piece_total = sp.Mul(coral_piece_price, coral_piece_qty)\nfish_total = sp.Mul(fish_price, fish_qty)\nfish_food_total = fish_food_price\n\n# Combine all costs\ntotal_amount = sp.Add(fish_tank_total, stone_packet_total, coral_piece_total, fish_total, fish_food_total)\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_amount)\n```"
