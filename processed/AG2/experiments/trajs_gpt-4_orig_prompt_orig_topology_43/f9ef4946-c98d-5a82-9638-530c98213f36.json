On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he had to stay up late over the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes. How many hours did he watch TV in total?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to convert all watching time into the same unit (hours) and then simply add all these times up to get the total number of hours. \n\nWe know that:\n- On Mondays and Tuesdays, Frankie watches 1-hour long episode per day (So, 2 days * 1 hour/day = 2 hours).\n- On Wednesday, he watches three 30-minute episodes (So, 3 episodes * 30 minutes/episode = 90 minutes). And we know that 60 minutes equals 1 hour. So, the watching time on Wednesday is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.\n- On Thursday, he watches for (1 hour + 30 minutes) which equals to 1.5 hours.\n- On Friday, he watches two one-hour episodes which equals to 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, to find the total number of hours Frankie watches TV, we just need to add up all these times.\n\nLet's do the calculations now."
