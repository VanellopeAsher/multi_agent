You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Then, the number made on Friday will be 2x.\n\nAccording to the problem, we have the equation:\n\nx (Tuesday) + x (Wednesday) + 2x (Friday) = 500 (total)\n\nWe can simplify this equation as:\n\n4x = 500\n\nFinally, we can solve the equation for x to find the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday (which is the same as Wednesday).\n\nPython can easily solve this equation for us.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the variable for the problem\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# set up the equation\neq = Eq(4*x, 500)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(eq, x)\n\n# output the solution\nprint(f\"The number of chimichangas they make on Tuesday is {solution[0]}\")\n```"
