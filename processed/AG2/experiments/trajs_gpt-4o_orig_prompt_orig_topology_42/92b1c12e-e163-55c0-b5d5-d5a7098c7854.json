You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.

Here's the strategy:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the age of Carver's daughter.\n2. Let \\( y \\) be the age of Carver's son.\n\nGiven:\n- Carver is 45 years old.\n- Carver's age is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter: \\( 2x - 5 = 45 \\).\n- Carver's daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son: \\( x = 3y + 4 \\).\n\nWe will solve this set of equations:\n\n1. Solve \\( 2x - 5 = 45 \\) to find \\( x \\).\n2. Use the value of \\( x \\) to solve for \\( y \\) using \\( x = 3y + 4 \\).\n\nLet's write a Python program to do this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Equation 1: 2x - 5 = 45\nequation1 = Eq(2*x - 5, 45)\n\n# Solve equation1 for x\nx_value = solve(equation1, x)[0]\n\n# Equation 2: x = 3y + 4\nequation2 = Eq(x_value, 3*y + 4)\n\n# Solve equation2 for y (son's age)\ny_value = solve(equation2, y)[0]\n\n# Print the son's age\nprint(y_value)\n```\n\nThis program will calculate the son's age, ensuring we adhere to the relationships described in the problem."
