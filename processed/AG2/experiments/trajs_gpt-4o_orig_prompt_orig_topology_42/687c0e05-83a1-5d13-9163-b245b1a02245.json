You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many unicorns are in the world based on the information about Scottish unicorns. This problem can be handled by trying to deduce the total number of unicorns given the fractions and counts provided. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n2. According to the problem, two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female, and there are 6 female unicorns. Therefore, we can set up the equation \\(\\frac{2}{3}x = 6\\) to solve for \\( x \\).\n3. Once we find \\( x \\), we'll know the total number of unicorns in Scotland.\n4. The problem states that a third of all unicorns in the world are in the Scottish Highlands. Thus, \\( x \\) is equal to one-third of the total number of unicorns in the world.\n5. Solve \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\text{total unicorns} = x\\) to find the total number of unicorns.\n\nLet's calculate step 2 and step 5 using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 2: Solve for the number of unicorns in Scotland\nx = symbols('x')\nequation_scotland = Eq(2/3 * x, 6)\nunicorns_in_scotland = solve(equation_scotland, x)[0]\n\n# Step 5: Use the number of unicorns in Scotland to find total number in the world\ntotal_unicorns = symbols('total_unicorns')\nequation_total = Eq(1/3 * total_unicorns, unicorns_in_scotland)\ntotal_number_of_unicorns = solve(equation_total, total_unicorns)[0]\n\nprint(total_number_of_unicorns)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the total number of unicorns worldwide. Run this code to find the solution."
