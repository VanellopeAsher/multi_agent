You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn goes to the market with $10,000 in his pocket.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money John spent at the market by adding the cost of the goats and the cows he purchased. This problem can be solved directly with Python code.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the goats: \\( \\text{cost per goat} \\times \\text{number of goats} \\).\n2. Calculate the total cost of the cows: \\( \\text{cost per cow} \\times \\text{number of cows} \\).\n3. Add the costs from step 1 and step 2 to find the total money spent.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Define the costs and quantities\ncost_per_goat = 500\nnumber_of_goats = 3\ncost_per_cow = 1500\nnumber_of_cows = 2\n\n# Calculate total costs\ntotal_cost_goats = cost_per_goat * number_of_goats\ntotal_cost_cows = cost_per_cow * number_of_cows\n\n# Calculate total money spent\ntotal_spent = total_cost_goats + total_cost_cows\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total amount of money John spent at the market."
