If the seller also bought a tablet for $330 and a pair of headphones for $137, how much will the seller give back in change after deducting the cost of the phones, the tablet, and the headphones?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAn electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each and gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills.

Calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.\n2. Add the cost of the tablet.\n3. Add the cost of the headphones.\n4. Subtract the total cost from the amount given to find the change.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the given amounts.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total cost of the items\ncost_per_phone = 700\nnumber_of_phones = 5\nphone_cost = cost_per_phone * number_of_phones\n\ntablet_cost = 330\nheadphones_cost = 137\n\n# Calculate the total cost of all items purchased\ntotal_cost = phone_cost + tablet_cost + headphones_cost\n\n# Amount given to the seller\namount_given = 4000\n\n# Calculate the change to be given back\nchange = amount_given - total_cost\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Change to be given back is:\", change)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total cost of all items and determines how much change should be returned after deducting the cost from the amount given. Let's see if it works correctly."
