You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.

The total area of the comforter is 68 square feet, so there are 68 squares in total.\n2. There are 14 red squares.\n3. There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.\n4. There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.\n5. The number of white squares is much fewer than the number of green squares.\n\nLet's go through these relationships to find how many fewer white squares there are compared to green squares.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Calculate the number of blue squares based on the number of red squares.\n2. Calculate the number of green squares based on the number of blue squares.\n3. Use the total number of squares to find the number of white squares.\n4. Determine how many fewer white squares there are compared to green squares.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n```python\n# Given number of red squares\nred_squares = 14\n\n# Calculate blue squares (4 more than red squares)\nblue_squares = red_squares + 4\n\n# Calculate green squares (6 more than blue squares)\ngreen_squares = blue_squares + 6\n\n# Calculate total squares accounted for so far\ntotal_colored_squares = red_squares + blue_squares + green_squares\n\n# Total squares in the comforter\ntotal_squares = 68\n\n# Calculate white squares\nwhite_squares = total_squares - total_colored_squares\n\n# Calculate how much fewer white squares are than green squares\ndifference = green_squares - white_squares\n\n# Print the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nUsing this code, let's find out how much fewer the white squares are compared to the green squares."
