You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.

According to the problem, Carver's age is 60, which is 8 years less than twice the age of his son.\n\nThis gives us the equation:\n\\[ 60 = 2x - 8 \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the son's age.\n\n### Key Idea\n\nThis problem can be directly solved using Python, as we need to solve a simple linear equation. Here's the corresponding Python code using `sympy` to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(2*x - 8, 60)\n\n# Solve the equation for the son's age\nsons_age = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the son's age\nprint(sons_age[0])\n```\n\nThis code sets up the equation \\( 60 = 2x - 8 \\) and solves for \\( x \\). Running this code will provide the age of Carver's son in years."
