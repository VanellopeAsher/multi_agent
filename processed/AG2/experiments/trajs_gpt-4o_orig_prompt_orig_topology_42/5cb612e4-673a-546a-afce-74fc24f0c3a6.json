You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of bags of wheat the trader sold. We'll break down the cost and profit structure as follows:\n\n1. **Cost per Bag**: The trader buys each bag at $20, and it costs an additional $2 to transport each bag to the warehouse. Thus, the total cost per bag is \\( 20 + 2 = 22 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Selling Price per Bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.\n\n3. **Profit per Bag**: The profit made by selling one bag is \\( 30 - 22 = 8 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Total Profit**: The total profit made by the trader is $400.\n\nTo find the number of bags sold, we will divide the total profit by the profit per bag.\n\nTo compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Computations\ntotal_profit = 400\nprofit_per_bag = 30 - 22\n\n# Calculate the number of bags sold\nnumber_of_bags_sold = total_profit / profit_per_bag\n\n# Output the result\nprint(number_of_bags_sold)\n```\n\nLet's solve it to find the number of bags he sold.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bags sold} = \\frac{\\text{Total profit}}{\\text{Profit per bag}} = \\frac{400}{8} = 50\n\\]\n\nThus, the trader sold \\(\\boxed{50}\\) bags."
