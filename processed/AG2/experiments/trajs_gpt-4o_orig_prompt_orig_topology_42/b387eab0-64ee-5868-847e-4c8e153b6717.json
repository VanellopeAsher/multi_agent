If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, and they have a coupon that offers a 10% discount on the total price after cashback, how much will they pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we can use Python code to calculate the total price after applying both the cashback and the coupon discount. Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n1. Calculate the initial total cost for buying 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.\n2. Calculate the cashback amount received, which is $0.20 per gallon.\n3. Subtract the cashback from the initial total cost to get the intermediate cost.\n4. Apply the 10% coupon discount on the intermediate cost.\n5. The result will be the amount paid for the gas after both discounts.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices and discounts\nprice_per_gallon = Rational(3, 1)  # $3.00 per gallon\ncash_back_per_gallon = Rational(20, 100)  # $0.20 cashback per gallon\ngallons = 10\ncoupon_discount = Rational(10, 100)  # 10% discount\n\n# Calculate initial cost\ninitial_cost = price_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Calculate total cashback\ntotal_cash_back = cash_back_per_gallon * gallons\n\n# Calculate intermediate cost after cashback\nintermediate_cost = initial_cost - total_cash_back\n\n# Calculate final cost after applying the coupon\nfinal_cost = intermediate_cost * (1 - coupon_discount)\n\nprint(final_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the final amount paid for 10 gallons of gas after applying the cashback and the coupon. Let's run it!"
