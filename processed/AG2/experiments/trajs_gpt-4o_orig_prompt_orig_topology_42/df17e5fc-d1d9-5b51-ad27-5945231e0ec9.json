You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it.

Use the remaining paint amount to find out how much red paint was used if there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.\n\nLet's solve it step-by-step:\n\nGiven:\n- Total paint = 12 pints\n- Half of the mural is yellow.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of yellow paint.\n\\[\n\\text{Yellow paint} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n\\]\n\nStep 2: The remaining paint is shared equally among red, white, and purple.\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n\\]\n\nSince red, white, and purple are equal, the amount of each color is:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ pints}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.\n\nThus, the solution for the amount of red paint is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
