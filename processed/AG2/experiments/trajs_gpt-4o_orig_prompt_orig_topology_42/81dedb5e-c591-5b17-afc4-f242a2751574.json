You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

      "content": "Key Idea: To solve this problem, we need to find a fraction of the original length of the ribbon. Specifically, since we are dividing the ribbon into 4 equal parts and then each of those parts into 5 equal parts, we can use multiplication of fractions to find the length of each final cut.\n\nCase 1: We can solve this problem using Python code to compute the final length mathematically.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Let x be the initial length of the ribbon.\n\n# Length of each of the 4 equal parts\npart_length = Rational(1, 4)\n\n# Length of each of the 5 parts from the previously cut part\nfinal_cut_length = part_length * Rational(1, 5)\n\n# Simplifying the final length\nfinal_cut_length = final_cut_length.simplify()\n\nprint(f\"Each final cut will be: {final_cut_length} of the original length\")\n```\n\nThis Python code uses the `sympy` library to handle fractions symbolically, ensuring the result is in its simplest form. The final answer will be provided in fractions instead of decimals."
