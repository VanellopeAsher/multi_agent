You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

This can be done directly using Python code, as it involves straightforward arithmetic operations.\n\nWe'll calculate the total amount spent as follows:\n\n1. Fish tank: $10.00\n2. Two packets of stones: \\(2 \\times 2.50\\)\n3. Three coral pieces: \\(3 \\times 2.00\\)\n4. Twenty fish: \\(20 \\times 0.50\\)\n5. One packet of fish food: $2.00\n\nLet's write a Python program to compute the total sum:\n\n```python\n# Define the costs\nfish_tank = 10.00\ntwo_stones = 2 * 2.50\nthree_corals = 3 * 2.00\ntwenty_fish = 20 * 0.50\nfish_food = 2.00\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = fish_tank + two_stones + three_corals + twenty_fish + fish_food\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find the total amount Scarlett spent."
