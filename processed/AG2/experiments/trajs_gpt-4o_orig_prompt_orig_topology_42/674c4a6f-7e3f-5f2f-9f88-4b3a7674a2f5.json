You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTo have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class.

The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation:\n\n1. Add up all the test scores.\n2. Divide the total by the number of test scores to find the average.\n\nWe can use Python to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary library\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# List of test scores\nscores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the scores\ntotal_score = sum(scores)\n\n# Calculate the average using Fraction to keep it in fraction form if needed\naverage_score = Fraction(total_score, len(scores))\n\n# Print the current math grade\nprint(average_score)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find Wilson's current math grade."

You've calculated the sum of the test scores to be 421, and when dividing by 5 (the number of tests), we get the average as \\( \\frac{421}{5} \\).\n\nLet's convert this fraction to a more understandable form:\n\n\\( \\frac{421}{5} = 84.2 \\)\n\nThus, Wilson's current math grade is 84.2. Since he needs an 85 or higher, he unfortunately does not meet the requirement of having at least an 85 to get the car for the weekend.\n\nThe final answer for Wilson's current math grade is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{84.2}\\)"
