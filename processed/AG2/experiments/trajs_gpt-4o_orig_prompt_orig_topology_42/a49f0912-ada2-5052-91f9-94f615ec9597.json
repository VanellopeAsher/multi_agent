You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing. The problem states that sightseeing took 40% of his total time. We also know that:\n\n- Boating time: 60 hours\n- Swimming time: Half of boating time = \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) hours\n- Watching shows: 30 shows \\(\\times\\) 20 hours/show = 600 hours (This constitutes 30% of the total time)\n\nGiven the above, we can calculate the total time John spent on vacation, and from there, find the amount of time he spent sightseeing using the information that sightseeing made up 40% of his vacation time. We can solve this using Python. Let's set up and solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the total vacation time using the fact that 600 hours is 30% of the total time.\n2. Compute the sightseeing time which is 40% of the total time.\n\nHere's how you can solve it with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let T be the total vacation time\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# According to the problem, 30% of the total time was spent watching shows\n# 30% of T = 600 hours\nequation = Eq(0.3 * T, 600)\n\n# Solve for T\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Sightseeing time is 40% of the total time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time\n\n# Print the time spent sightseeing in fraction form\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(sightseeing_time))\n```\n\nRunning this code will compute the time John spent sightseeing in a fractional form if applicable. Let's perform these calculations to find the answer."
