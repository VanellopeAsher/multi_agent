You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nClaire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into a simple calculation of total eggs used over a specified time period. Since a dozen consists of 12 eggs, we'll need to find out how many dozens Claire will consume based on her daily omelet habit. Let's proceed with the calculation using Python.\n\nClaire eats 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. We need to find the total number of eggs she will eat in 12 weeks and then convert that number to dozens.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs eaten in 12 weeks.\n2. Convert that number to dozens.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# number of eggs used per day\neggs_per_day = 3\n\n# number of days in 12 weeks (assuming Claire eats omelets every day)\ndays = 12 * 7\n\n# total number of eggs consumed in 12 weeks\ntotal_eggs = eggs_per_day * days\n\n# calculate the number of dozens\ndozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / 12\n\n# print the result in radical form\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(dozens_of_eggs))\n```\n\nThis code will compute how many dozens of eggs Claire uses in 12 weeks. After running this code, it will output the result in a fractional form using `sympy`."
