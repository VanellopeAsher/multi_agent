She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a straightforward calculation to add up the total cost of the gum packs. We'll account for the individual costs of each type of gum. This falls under Case 1: The problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\nHere's the key idea:\n- Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, each costing $2.\n- She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.\n- She bought one small pack of green apple gum, which cost half of what the grape gum cost. Therefore, the green apple gum cost $1.\n\nLet's sum these costs using Python.\n\n```python\n# Cost calculations\nstrawberry_gum_cost = 2 * 2  # 2 packs of strawberry at $2 each\ngrape_gum_cost = 2           # 1 pack of grape gum at $2\ngreen_apple_gum_cost = grape_gum_cost / 2  # half of the grape gum cost\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = strawberry_gum_cost + grape_gum_cost + green_apple_gum_cost\n\n# Print the total cost in a readable form\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(f\"Total cost: {Rational(total_cost)}\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the total amount Suzie paid for all the gum packs and display it as a fraction, though in this case, it should be a whole number. Let's run the code to find out the total."
