You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Pauline spent on museum visits over 13 years, considering that the cost per visit increases after the first 10 years.\n\nHere's how we can break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Cost Calculation**: For the first 10 years, the cost of one visit is $10, and Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. We need to calculate the total cost for these 10 years.\n\n2. **Cost Increase**: After 10 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. We need to calculate the new cost per visit.\n\n3. **Additional Visits**: Pauline continues visiting the museum for 3 more years. We need to calculate the total cost for these 3 years at the increased price.\n\n4. **Total Cost**: Add the total costs from the two periods to find the overall amount spent.\n\nLet's use Python to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the initial conditions\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10  # dollars\nvisits_per_year = 3\nyears_before_increase = 10\n\n# Calculate the total cost for the first 10 years\ntotal_cost_first_period = initial_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_before_increase\n\n# Calculate the new cost per visit after 150% increase\nnew_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit * (1 + Rational(150, 100))\n\n# Define the additional years\nadditional_years = 3\n\n# Calculate the total cost for the additional 3 years at the new cost\ntotal_cost_second_period = new_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * additional_years\n\n# Calculate the total cost over the entire period\ntotal_cost = total_cost_first_period + total_cost_second_period\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will output the total amount Pauline spent on all museum visits over the 13 years."
