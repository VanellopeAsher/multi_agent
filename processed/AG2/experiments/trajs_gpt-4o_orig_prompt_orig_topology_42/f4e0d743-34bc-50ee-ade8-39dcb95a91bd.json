You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total yearly cost of each item and then sum them up. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how we can do it:\n\n1. **Food Costs**: The dog food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is \\( 25 \\times 4 \\). To find the yearly cost, multiply the monthly cost by 12 months.\n\n2. **Treat Costs**: Treats cost $20 per month, so the yearly cost is \\( 20 \\times 12 \\).\n\n3. **Medicine Costs**: Medicine costs $100 per month, so the yearly cost is \\( 100 \\times 12 \\).\n\n4. **Shampoo Costs**: Shampoo costs $15 per month, which results in a yearly cost of \\( 15 \\times 12 \\).\n\n5. **Toy Costs**: The toy costs $10 every two months, meaning Madeline buys 6 toys per year. Therefore, the yearly cost is \\( 10 \\times 6 \\).\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate the total annual cost Madeline spends on her dog.\n\n```python\n# Define costs\nweekly_food_cost = 25\nmonthly_treat_cost = 20\nmonthly_medicine_cost = 100\nmonthly_shampoo_cost = 15\nbimonthly_toy_cost = 10\n\n# Calculate annual costs\nannual_food_cost = weekly_food_cost * 4 * 12\nannual_treat_cost = monthly_treat_cost * 12\nannual_medicine_cost = monthly_medicine_cost * 12\nannual_shampoo_cost = monthly_shampoo_cost * 12\nannual_toy_cost = bimonthly_toy_cost * 6\n\n# Calculate total annual cost\ntotal_annual_cost = (annual_food_cost + annual_treat_cost +\n                     annual_medicine_cost + annual_shampoo_cost +\n                     annual_toy_cost)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year is: ${total_annual_cost}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total annual expenditure Madeline incurs for her dog. Let's sum them up:\n\n- Annual food cost: \\( 25 \\times 4 \\times 12 = 1200 \\)\n- Annual treat cost: \\( 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\)\n- Annual medicine cost: \\( 100 \\times 12 = 1200 \\)\n- Annual shampoo cost: \\( 15 \\times 12 = 180 \\)\n- Annual toy cost: \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\)\n\nBy adding all these together, the total amount is \\(\\boxed{2880}\\)."
