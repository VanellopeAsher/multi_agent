      "content": "To solve this problem, we will first need to determine the total number of cards Miss Maria has, subtract the cards she keeps, and then distribute the remaining cards among the students. Here's how we can solve it step-by-step:\n\n### Key Idea\nWe can solve this problem directly with Python. We'll calculate the total number of cards using basic arithmetic, then determine how many cards are given to the students, and finally divide the cards among the students.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball and baseball cards:\n   - Basketball: 6 decks, 25 cards each\n   - Baseball: 5 boxes, 40 cards each\n\n2. Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has.\n\n3. Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps (50 cards) to find the number of cards given to the students.\n\n4. Assume each student receives 10 cards and determine the number of students by dividing the total cards intended for the students by 10.\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy for cleaner output if needed (although not essential for this calculation)\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\nbasketball_cards_per_deck = 25\nbaseball_cards_per_box = 40\nnum_basketball_decks = 6\nnum_baseball_boxes = 5\ncards_maria_keeps = 50\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Total cards calculation\ntotal_basketball_cards = num_basketball_decks * basketball_cards_per_deck\ntotal_baseball_cards = num_baseball_boxes * baseball_cards_per_box\ntotal_cards = total_basketball_cards + total_baseball_cards\n\n# Cards given to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_maria_keeps\n\n# Calculate number of students\nnumber_of_students = Rational(cards_given_to_students, cards_per_student)\n\n# Print result\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the number of students. Now let's calculate it. \n\nTotal basketball cards = \\( 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\)\n\nTotal baseball cards = \\( 5 \\times 40 = 200 \\)\n\nTotal cards = \\( 150 + 200 = 350 \\)\n\nCards given to students = \\( 350 - 50 = 300 \\)\n\nNumber of students = \\( \\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\)\n\nThus, Miss Maria has \\(\\boxed{30}\\) students."
