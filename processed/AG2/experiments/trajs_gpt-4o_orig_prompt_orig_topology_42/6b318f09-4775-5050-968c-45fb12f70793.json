You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

Calculate the total number of people invited from the 12 families with 6 people each.\n2. Calculate the total number of people invited from the 15 families with 4 people each.\n3. Subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness.\n4. Subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to previous commitments (which is 1/4 of those who couldn't come due to illness).\n5. Calculate the total number of people who show up for the party.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step calculation in Python:\n\n```python\n# Using sympy to handle fractions precisely\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of people invited from 12 families with 6 people each\nfamilies_6 = 12 * 6\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number of people invited from 15 families with 4 people each\nfamilies_4 = 15 * 4\n\n# Step 3: Combine these to get the total number invited\ntotal_invited = families_6 + families_4\n\n# Step 4: Number of people who couldn't come due to illness\nillness_count = 16\n\n# Step 5: Number of people who had previous commitments (1/4 of illness_count)\ncommitments_count = illness_count * Rational(1, 4)\n\n# Step 6: Total number of people who couldn't come\nnot_coming = illness_count + commitments_count\n\n# Step 7: Calculate the total number of people who show up\nshow_up = total_invited - not_coming\n\n# Step 8: Print the result\nprint(show_up)\n```\n\nLet's run these steps to find out how many people actually show up at Martha's party."
