      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out the total earnings Sunny made over the three days from selling gingerbread and apple pie. Here is a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on each day:**\n   - On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.\n   - On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than he did on Sunday. Let's denote by \\( x \\) the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday. Then the apple pie boxes sold on Saturday would be \\( 15 - 4 = 11 \\) boxes, since he sold 15 boxes on Sunday.\n   \n   - On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so \\( x = 10 + 5 = 15 \\) boxes.\n   - On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie.\n   \n   - On Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie.\n\n2. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**\n   - **Saturday:**\n     - Earnings from gingerbread: \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\) dollars.\n     - Earnings from apple pie: \\( 11 \\times 15 = 165 \\) dollars.\n     - Total earnings for Saturday: \\( 60 + 165 = 225 \\) dollars.\n     \n   - **Sunday:**\n     - Earnings from gingerbread: \\( 15 \\times 6 = 90 \\) dollars.\n     - Earnings from apple pie: \\( 15 \\times 15 = 225 \\) dollars.\n     - Total earnings for Sunday: \\( 90 + 225 = 315 \\) dollars.\n     \n   - **Monday:**\n     - Earnings from gingerbread: \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) dollars.\n     - Earnings from apple pie: \\( 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\) dollars.\n     - Total earnings for Monday: \\( 12 + 60 = 72 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Total earnings over the three days:**\n   - Add the earnings from each day: \\( 225 + 315 + 72 = 612 \\) dollars.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure correctness:\n\n```python\n# Calculate total earnings for each day\ngingerbread_cost = 6\napple_pie_cost = 15\n\n# Saturday earnings\nsaturday_gingerbread_boxes = 10\nsaturday_apple_pie_boxes = 15 - 4  # 4 fewer than Sunday\nsaturday_earnings = (saturday_gingerbread_boxes * gingerbread_cost) + (saturday_apple_pie_boxes * apple_pie_cost)\n\n# Sunday earnings\nsunday_gingerbread_boxes = 10 + 5  # 5 more than Saturday\nsunday_apple_pie_boxes = 15\nsunday_earnings = (sunday_gingerbread_boxes * gingerbread_cost) + (sunday_apple_pie_boxes * apple_pie_cost)\n\n# Monday earnings\nmonday_gingerbread_boxes = 2\nmonday_apple_pie_boxes = 4\nmonday_earnings = (monday_gingerbread_boxes * gingerbread_cost) + (monday_apple_pie_boxes * apple_pie_cost)\n\n# Total earnings\ntotal_earnings = saturday_earnings + sunday_earnings + monday_earnings\n\n# Print the total earnings\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total earnings over the three days:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{612}\n\\]"
