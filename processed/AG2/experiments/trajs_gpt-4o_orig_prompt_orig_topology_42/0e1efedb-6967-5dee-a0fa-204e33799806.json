You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26.

This can be solved directly with Python, as it is a straightforward calculation of adding the prices and subtracting the discount.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan to solve this:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost before the discount by adding the prices of the items purchased.\n2. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.\n3. Output the final result.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Prices of the items\nprice_of_pots = 19\nprice_of_soil = 26\n\n# Discount amount\ndiscount = 7\n\n# Calculate total expenditure after discount\ntotal_expenditure = price_of_pots + price_of_soil - discount\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The total amount of money expended is \\boxed{{{total_expenditure}}}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give the total amount of money expended by your mother at the gardening store."
