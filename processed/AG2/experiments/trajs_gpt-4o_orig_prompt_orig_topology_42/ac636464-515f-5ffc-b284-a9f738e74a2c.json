You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 30-mile lake.

Let's finalize the solution.\n\nThe output provides the times for each segment of James's swim:\n- Time for the first segment (70% of the distance at 3 miles per hour) is 7 hours.\n- Rest time (half of the swimming time for the first segment) is \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\) hours or 3.5 hours.\n- Time for the second segment (remaining 30% of the distance at 1.5 miles per hour) is 6 hours.\n\nThe total time James took to cross the lake is the sum of these times:\n\\[ 7 + \\frac{7}{2} + 6 = \\frac{33}{2} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time it took James to swim across the lake is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{33}{2}}\\) hours."
