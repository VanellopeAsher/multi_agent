You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small t-shirts Octavia used to make a quilt that covers a total area of 101 square feet, given that she used 8 medium and 6 large shirts.\n\nWe can express this problem as an equation based on the areas contributed by each size of the t-shirt:\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of small shirts used. The area contribution of each size of t-shirt is given as:\n- A small t-shirt contributes 3 square feet.\n- A medium t-shirt contributes 4 square feet.\n- A large t-shirt contributes 6 square feet.\n\nThe equation for the total area covered by the shirts is:\n\\[ 3x + 4 \\times 8 + 6 \\times 6 = 101 \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation for \\( x \\).\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the number of small shirts used:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation representing the total area\nequation = Eq(3*x + 4*8 + 6*6, 101)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nAfter running the above code, you will find the number of small shirts used. Let's evaluate this."
