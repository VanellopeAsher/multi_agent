You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use algebra to set up an equation based on the given conditions.\n\nKey Idea:\nWe will use algebraic expressions to represent the number of chimichangas made on each day and then solve the equation for the unknown quantity.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( x \\) = the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n- Since they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, they also make \\( x \\) chimichangas on Wednesday.\n- They make twice that amount on Friday, so they make \\( 2x \\) chimichangas on Friday.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of chimichangas made over these three days is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + x + 2x = 500 \\]\n\nNow let's solve this equation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Formulate the equation based on the problem description\nequation = Eq(x + x + 2 * x, 500)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find out how many chimichangas they make on Tuesday."
