You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to calculate how many rows of each color Jackson can plant and then account for the additional rows of yellow tulips he inserts between the other rows. Hereâ€™s how we can solve this:\n\n1. Calculate the number of rows of red tulips Jackson can plant using the number of red tulips he has.\n2. Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant using the number of blue tulips he has.\n3. Determine how many rows of yellow tulips can be planted with the yellow tulips.\n4. Compute the total number of rows of tulips by counting the rows of red and blue and adding a row of yellow tulips between each of them.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Calculation for the rows of red tulips\nred_tulips = 36\nred_in_row = 6\nrows_of_red = red_tulips // red_in_row\n\n# Calculation for the rows of blue tulips\nblue_tulips = 24\nblue_in_row = 8\nrows_of_blue = blue_tulips // blue_in_row\n\n# Calculate how many rows of yellow tulips Jackson can plant\nyellow_tulips = 30\nyellow_in_row = 5\nrows_of_yellow = yellow_tulips // yellow_in_row\n\n# Total rows of tulips\n# Add rows for every inserted row of yellow tulips\ntotal_rows = rows_of_red + rows_of_blue + (rows_of_red + rows_of_blue - 1)\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nHere, we calculate the number of red and blue rows and insert a yellow row between each. Let's run the code to find the number of total rows."

Here's how the answer was obtained:\n\n- Jackson can plant \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) rows of red tulips.\n- Jackson can plant \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\) rows of blue tulips.\n- Jackson will plant yellow tulips between each of the above rows. Therefore, with 6 red and 3 blue rows, he will have 8 spaces in between (inserting yellow rows at every junction between blue and red rows and one at the very end).\n\nThus, the total number of rows of flowers, including the additional yellow rows, is \\( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of rows of flowers planted by Jackson is \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."
