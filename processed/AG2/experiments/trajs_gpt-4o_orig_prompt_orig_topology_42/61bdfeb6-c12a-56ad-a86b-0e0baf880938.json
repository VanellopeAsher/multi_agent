You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSamwell owns an appliance store.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Case 1 as it involves a straightforward calculation.\n\nThe key idea is to calculate the total number of TVs that are not smart TVs, analog TVs, or projection TVs, which will be the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nHere's how we can compute that:\n\n1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold by taking one-fourth of the total sales.\n2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold by taking one-eighth of the total sales.\n3. Calculate the number of projection TVs sold by taking one-fifth of the total sales.\n4. Subtract the sum of these quantities from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nWe can use the `sympy` package to handle the fractions accurately and perform the necessary arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's write the Python code to do the calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of TVs sold\ntotal_TVs = 40\n\n# Calculate the number of each type of TV sold\nsmart_TVs = Rational(1, 4) * total_TVs\nanalog_TVs = Rational(1, 8) * total_TVs\nprojection_TVs = Rational(1, 5) * total_TVs\n\n# Calculate the remaining TVs (OLED TVs)\nOLED_TVs = total_TVs - (smart_TVs + analog_TVs + projection_TVs)\n\n# Print the result in fraction\nprint(OLED_TVs)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the number of OLED TVs sold in fraction form."
