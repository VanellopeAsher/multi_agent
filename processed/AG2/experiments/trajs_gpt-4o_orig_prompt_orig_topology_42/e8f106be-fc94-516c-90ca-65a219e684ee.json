His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the scenario. We have a rectangular backyard fence where the long side measures 20 feet, and the short side measures 15 feet. James is planning to hang crepe-paper streamers along the perimeter of the fence.\n\nKey Idea: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence, as this perimeter will be the length of crepe paper needed. The presence of the tree in the middle does not affect this calculation because he won't hang streamers there, and it's specifically in the middle of the yard, not on the fence. \n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nIn this case, the length is 20 feet, and the width is 15 feet. Thus, we will calculate the required perimeter using this formula.\n\nLet's write a Python code snippet to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nlength = 20  # feet\nwidth = 15   # feet\n\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nPlease run the above code to get the result."
