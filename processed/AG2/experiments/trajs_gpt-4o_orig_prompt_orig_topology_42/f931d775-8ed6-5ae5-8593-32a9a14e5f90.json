  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of lines that Sean has to memorize, considering both the scenes and the song. We'll do this using some calculations based on the information provided:\n\n1. Calculate the lines from the solo song.\n2. Determine the number of lines in the first scene, then calculate Sean's lines.\n3. Determine the number of lines in the second scene, then calculate Sean's lines.\n4. Add up all the lines Sean has to memorize.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem systematically:\n\n1. **Solo song:** 54 lines directly.\n2. **First scene:**\n   - Number of lines = 2 times the solo song = \\(2 \\times 54 = 108\\) lines.\n   - Sean's lines = \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the first scene = \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36\\) lines.\n3. **Second scene:**\n   - Number of lines = 6 more than the solo song = \\(54 + 6 = 60\\) lines.\n   - Originally planned Sean's lines = \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) of the second scene = \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48\\) lines.\n   - Since one actor can't come, Sean has to memorize an additional 15 lines, making it \\(48 + 15 = 63\\) lines.\n\nFinally, calculate the total lines Sean has to memorize:\n\n- Total lines = Sean's lines from the song + Sean's lines from the first scene + Sean's lines from the second scene\n- Total lines = \\(54 + 36 + 63\\)\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate and print the total lines:\n\n```python\n# Calculating lines\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Song\nsong_lines = 54\n\n# First scene\nfirst_scene_total_lines = 2 * song_lines\nfirst_scene_sean_lines = Rational(1, 3) * first_scene_total_lines\n\n# Second scene\nsecond_scene_total_lines = song_lines + 6\nsecond_scene_initial_sean_lines = Rational(4, 5) * second_scene_total_lines\n# Including the 15 additional lines\nsecond_scene_sean_lines = second_scene_initial_sean_lines + 15\n\n# Total memorized lines\ntotal_sean_lines = song_lines + first_scene_sean_lines + second_scene_sean_lines\nprint(total_sean_lines)\n```\n\nExecute the code to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize."
