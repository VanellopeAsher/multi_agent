You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTim concocts a unique blend of honey and jam.

Calculate the cost per pound for each ingredient.\n2. Compute the total cost of these ingredients for one jar.\n3. Determine the selling price for 10 jars.\n4. Compute the profit.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost per pound for the ingredients.\ncost_passion_fruit_per_pound = 6\ncost_jackfruit_per_pound = 8\ncost_honey_per_pound = 10\n\n# Define the weight required for each ingredient for one jar.\nweight_passion_fruit = 2\nweight_jackfruit = 1.5\nweight_honey = 2\n\n# Calculate the cost for each ingredient for one jar.\ncost_passion_fruit = cost_passion_fruit_per_pound * weight_passion_fruit\ncost_jackfruit = cost_jackfruit_per_pound * weight_jackfruit\ncost_honey = cost_honey_per_pound * weight_honey\n\n# Total production cost for one jar.\ntotal_cost_per_jar = cost_passion_fruit + cost_jackfruit + cost_honey\n\n# Selling price for one jar.\nselling_price_per_jar = 50\n\n# Determine the profit for selling 10 jars.\nnum_jars = 10\ntotal_revenue = selling_price_per_jar * num_jars\ntotal_cost = total_cost_per_jar * num_jars\nprofit = total_revenue - total_cost\n\n# Output the profit.\nprint(profit)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the profit Tim earns from selling 10 jars of the blend.
