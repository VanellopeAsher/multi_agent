  "problem": "Frankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework. On Mondays and Tuesdays, he watches an hour-long episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he had to stay up late over the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes. How many hours did he watch TV in total?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFrankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework.

Let's break it down day by day:\n\n- **Monday:** 1 hour\n- **Tuesday:** 1 hour\n- **Wednesday:** 3 episodes × 30 minutes each = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours\n- **Thursday:** 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours\n- **Friday:** 2 episodes × 1 hour each = 2 hours\n\nNow sum all these time durations to find the total number of hours Frankie watched TV:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hours} = 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2\n\\]\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this total:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the times in hours\nmonday = Rational(1)\ntuesday = Rational(1)\nwednesday = Rational(90, 60)  # 90 minutes is 1.5 hours\nthursday = Rational(90, 60)  # 1 hour and 30 minutes is 1.5 hours\nfriday = Rational(2)\n\n# Calculate the total time\ntotal_hours = monday + tuesday + wednesday + thursday + friday\n\n# Print the total hours watched in fractional form\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, the output will show the fraction representing the total number of hours. Let's print the result:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\] \n\nFrankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week."
