You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will break down the total bill into its individual components: the service fee, labor costs, and the cost of parts. The key idea is to calculate each component and then sum them up for the total bill.\n\n### Calculating Each Component:\n\n1. **Service Fee:** The fixed cost of making a house call is $40.\n2. **Labor Cost:** Patty charges $35 per hour or fraction of an hour. Since the job takes 2.25 hours, we need to consider this as 3 hours of labor (since any fraction of an hour is counted as a full hour).\n3. **Cost of Parts:** The total cost for the parts used in this job is $60.\n\n### Total Cost Calculation:\n\nThe total bill is the sum of the service fee, the labor cost (based on 3 hours), and the cost of the parts.\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Cost components\nservice_fee = 40\nhours_worked = 2.25\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# Calculate the labor cost (rounding up to the next whole hour)\nimport math\nlabor_hours = math.ceil(hours_worked)\nlabor_cost_per_hour = 35\ntotal_labor_cost = labor_hours * labor_cost_per_hour\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = service_fee + total_labor_cost + parts_cost\n\n# Output\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing for the job. Let me calculate this for you."

With the calculation, the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing for the job is \\(\\boxed{205}\\). \n\nTo summarize, this total includes:\n- A $40 service fee for the house call,\n- $105 in labor costs (calculated as 3 hours of labor at $35 per hour), and\n- $60 for the cost of parts. \n\nThe calculation is straightforward but involves ensuring that the labor time is rounded up to the nearest hour for billing purposes, as they charge per hour or fraction of an hour."
