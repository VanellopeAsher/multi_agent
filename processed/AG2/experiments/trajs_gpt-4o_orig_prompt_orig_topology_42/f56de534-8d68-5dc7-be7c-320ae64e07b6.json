You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.

This is a problem that can be handled with a direct Python code implementation since it involves straightforward addition of numbers.\n\nWe have four different sets of Lego pieces:\n1. A box with 500 pieces.\n2. Another box with 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece one.\n3. Another box with 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500-piece one.\n4. Another box with 125 more pieces than the 500-piece one.\n\nThe key idea is to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then sum them up.\n\nLet's write the Python code to do the calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of pieces in the first box\nbox1_pieces = 500\n\n# Number of pieces in the second box (3 times more than the first box)\nbox2_pieces = 3 * box1_pieces\n\n# Number of pieces in the third box (1/4 of the first box)\nbox3_pieces = Rational(1, 4) * box1_pieces\n\n# Number of pieces in the fourth box (125 more than the first box)\nbox4_pieces = box1_pieces + 125\n\n# Total number of pieces\ntotal_pieces = box1_pieces + box2_pieces + box3_pieces + box4_pieces\n\nprint(total_pieces)\n```\n\nLet's perform the calculation now."
