You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

Let's proceed with Case 1, where we can directly code a solution using Python.\n\n### Key Idea\nLet's define the variables in the problem:\n- Let \\( w \\) be the number of wolves Rick killed last night.\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cougars Rick killed last night.\n- Let \\( w' \\) be the number of wolves Rick killed today.\n- Let \\( c' \\) be the number of cougars Rick killed today.\n\nThe problem provides the following relations:\n1. Last night, the number of wolves Rick killed was 10, so \\( w = 10 \\).\n2. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so \\( w' = 3c' \\).\n3. He killed three fewer cougars today than last night, so \\( c' = c - 3 \\).\n\nOur goal is to determine the total number of animals Rick killed over the two days, which is \\( w + c + w' + c' \\).\n\nNow let's write the code to solve for these equations and find the total number of animals Rick killed.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nc, c_prime, w_prime = symbols('c c_prime w_prime')\n\n# Last night's wolves\nw = 10\n\n# Equations based on the problem statement\nequation1 = Eq(w_prime, 3 * c_prime)  # Today, three times as many wolves as cougars\nequation2 = Eq(c_prime, c - 3)        # Today's cougars, three fewer than last night\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolutions = solve((equation1, equation2), (c, c_prime, w_prime))\n\n# Extract values from the solutions\nc_value = solutions[c]\nc_prime_value = solutions[c_prime]\nw_prime_value = solutions[w_prime]\n\n# Total number of animals killed\ntotal_animals = w + c_value + w_prime_value + c_prime_value\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_animals)\n```\n\nRun the above code, and once you have the results, we can determine the total number of animals Rick killed."
