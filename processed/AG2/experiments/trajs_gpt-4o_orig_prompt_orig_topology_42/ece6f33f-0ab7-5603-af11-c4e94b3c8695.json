You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJenna shares her living space with four other people.

Here's the key idea:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly cost per person by dividing the total monthly electricity cost by the number of people sharing it.\n2. Multiply the monthly cost per person by the number of months in a year to find the annual contribution per person.\n\nLet's write the program to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary libraries\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total monthly electricity cost\nmonthly_cost = 100\n\n# Number of people sharing the cost\nnumber_of_people = 5\n\n# Calculate the monthly cost per person\nmonthly_cost_per_person = monthly_cost / number_of_people\n\n# Calculate the annual contribution per person\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_cost_per_person * 12\n\n# Using Rational to print the result as a fraction\nprint(Rational(annual_contribution_per_person))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill and print it in fraction form. Run the code to find the answer."
