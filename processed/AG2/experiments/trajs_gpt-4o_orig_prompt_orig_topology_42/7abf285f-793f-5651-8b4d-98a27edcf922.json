You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we must calculate the total amount Jessica pays on her debts per month and then determine how much she pays in a year. The problem provides information about the minimum payments on her debts and her intent to pay 50% more than the minimum. We also account for non-debt subscription services but focus solely on her debts for this calculation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly payments Jessica makes on each type of debt as follows:\n   - Student loans: Minimum is $300/month; she pays 50% more than this.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Student loan payment} = 300 + 0.5 \\times 300\n     \\]\n   - Credit card: Minimum is $200/month; she pays 50% more.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Credit card payment} = 200 + 0.5 \\times 200\n     \\]\n   - Mortgage: Minimum is $500/month; she pays 50% more.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mortgage payment} = 500 + 0.5 \\times 500\n     \\]\n\n2. Sum these increased payments to find her total monthly debt payments.\n\n3. Multiply this total by 12 to find her total annual debt payments.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python with `sympy` to maintain the desired fraction/radical forms:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the minimum payments\nstudent_loan_min = 300\ncredit_card_min = 200\nmortgage_min = 500\n\n# Calculate increased payments (50% more)\nstudent_loan_payment = student_loan_min + 0.5 * student_loan_min\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min + 0.5 * credit_card_min\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min + 0.5 * mortgage_min\n\n# Total monthly payment for debts\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Total annual payment\ntotal_annual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the annual payment in fractions\nprint(f'Total annual payment for debts: {total_annual_payment}')\n```\n\nIn this code, we're calculating the total monthly payment considering the 50% increase, summing these for the year, and outputting the annual figure. Run this code to find the final amount Jessica pays annually for her debts, which should then be displayed in a nicely formatted manner like \\(\\boxed{\\text{total annual payment}}\\)."
