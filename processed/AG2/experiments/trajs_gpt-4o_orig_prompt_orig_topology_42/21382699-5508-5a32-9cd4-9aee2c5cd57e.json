You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine Allen's current age and then find out what his age will be 10 years from now. We'll use the ratio of their ages and the total age to set up an equation, which we can solve using Python. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Let Darrell's age be \\(7x\\) and Allen's age be \\(11x\\). This is based on the given age ratio of 7:11.\n2. We know their total age is 162, so we can write the equation \\(7x + 11x = 162\\).\n3. Solve this equation to find the value of \\(x\\).\n4. Calculate Allen's current age using \\(11x\\).\n5. Find Allen's age 10 years from now by adding 10 to his current age.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the sympy library:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(7*x + 11*x, 162)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Calculate Allen's current age\nx_value = solution[0]\nallen_age_now = 11 * x_value\n\n# Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now\nallen_age_10_years = allen_age_now + 10\n\n# Print the result\nprint(allen_age_10_years)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we'll be able to determine Allen's age 10 years from now."

Given their total age is 162, we solved the equation \\(7x + 11x = 162\\) to find \\(x\\).\n3. With \\(x\\), we calculated Allen's current age as \\(11x\\).\n4. Finally, we added 10 years to Allen's current age to find his age 10 years from now.\n\nSo, Allen's age 10 years from now is \\(\\boxed{109}\\)."
