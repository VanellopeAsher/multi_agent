You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We'll also incorporate the additional step of Ali's sister giving half of her money to their mother, although this doesn't affect Ali's own leftover amount after dinner.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the total amount of money Ali initially has.\n\n- Ali's total money = (Number of $10 bills * $10) + (Number of $20 bills * $20)\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister.\n\n- Ali gives half of his total money to his sister.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the money Ali has after giving some to his sister.\n\n- Remaining after giving to sister = Total money - Money given to sister\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the amount Ali uses to buy dinner.\n\n- Amount used for dinner = \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the remaining money after giving to sister\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate how much money Ali has left after buying dinner.\n\n- Remaining money after dinner = Remaining money - Amount used for dinner\n\nLet's compute this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Importing the Fraction class from fractions module to handle calculations with fractions\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Initial amounts and values\nnum_10_bills = 4\nnum_20_bills = 6\n\n# Calculate the total money Ali has\ntotal_money = (num_10_bills * 10) + (num_20_bills * 20)\n\n# Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister\nmoney_to_sister = total_money / 2\n\n# Calculate remaining money after giving to sister\nremaining_after_giving = total_money - money_to_sister\n\n# Calculate the amount used for dinner\namount_for_dinner = Fraction(3, 5) * remaining_after_giving\n\n# Calculate remaining money after dinner\nremaining_after_dinner = remaining_after_giving - amount_for_dinner\n\n# Print the remaining money after dinner\nprint(remaining_after_dinner)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner.
