You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has some centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

      "content": "To find the total length of the ribbon Marty's working with, we can tackle the problem step by step. Let's start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n1. Marty cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts.\n2. Each of these 4 parts is further divided into 5 equal parts.\n3. Each of these smaller parts has a length of 5 cm.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n- Let the total length of the ribbon be denoted as \\( x \\) cm.\n- The ribbon is first cut into 4 equal parts, so each part is \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\) cm long.\n- Then, each of these 4 parts is divided into 5 further equal parts. Therefore, each of these smaller parts is \\( \\frac{x}{4 \\times 5} = \\frac{x}{20} \\) cm long.\n- We know each of these smallest parts is 5 cm in length.\n\nThus, setting up the equation based on the above information:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{20} = 5 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\) using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation according to the problem\nequation = Eq(x / 20, 5)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution in fraction form\nprint(solution[0])  \n```\n\nRun this code to find the length \\( x \\)."
