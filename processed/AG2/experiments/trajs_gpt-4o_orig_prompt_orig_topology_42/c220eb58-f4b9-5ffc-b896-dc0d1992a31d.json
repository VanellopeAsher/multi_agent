You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom.

Calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu using the given ratio.\n2. Sum up the messages delivered to both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. James delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson.\n2. He delivers \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) as many messages to Mr. Yu. Thus, the number of messages to Mr. Yu is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 84 \\).\n3. Add the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to get the total.\n\nWe can use Python to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of messages to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_to_thompson = 84\n\n# Number of messages to Mr. Yu\nmessages_to_yu = Rational(1, 3) * messages_to_thompson\n\n# Total messages\ntotal_messages = messages_to_thompson + messages_to_yu\n\n# Print the result in fraction form\nprint(total_messages)\n```\n\nRun this code to get the total number of messages. Let's calculate it."
