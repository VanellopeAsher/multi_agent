You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use algebra to find how many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi in each dose.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nLet's use algebraic expressions to define the relationship between the amounts of the two medicines and solve for the amount of one medicine per dose.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the amount of the first medicine (in mL) in one dose.\n2. Then, the second medicine would be \\( 3x \\) mL in one dose, as it is 3 times the amount of the first medicine.\n3. The total amount of medicine in one dose would therefore be \\( x + 3x = 4x \\) mL.\n4. Saanvi created 8 doses that sum to 448 mL, so the equation is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 4x = 448\n   \\]\n5. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Setup the equation\nequation = Eq(8 * 4 * x, 448)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the amount of the first medicine in one dose\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the amount in mL of one medicine that is used in each dose."
