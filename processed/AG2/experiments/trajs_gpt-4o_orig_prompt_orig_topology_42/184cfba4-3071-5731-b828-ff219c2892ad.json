You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided and solve for the unknowns.\n\nWe are given:\n- Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.\n- Each small stuffed animal costs $40.\n- She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.\n- She earned a total of $1200 from the sales.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( x \\) as the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n- \\( y \\) as the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following relationships:\n1. The price of each large stuffed animal is \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) dollars.\n2. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\( x = 2y \\).\n3. The total revenue from the sales is \\( 40x + 120y = 1200 \\).\n\nNow, substituting the first relationship into the second equation:\n\\[ 40(2y) + 120y = 1200 \\]\n\nNow let's solve for \\( y \\) using Python and then find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(x, 2 * y)\neq2 = Eq(40 * x + 120 * y, 1200)\n\n# Substitute eq1 into eq2 and solve for y\ny_value = solve(eq2.subs(x, 2 * y), y)[0]\n\n# Now substitute y back into eq1 to find x\nx_value = solve(eq1.subs(y, y_value), x)[0]\n\n# Print the value of x\nprint(x_value)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of small stuffed animals sold, which answers the problem question. Run it to get the result."

You've found that the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is 12.\n\nLet's check that calculation quickly:\n\nThe number of large stuffed animals, \\( y \\), would be \\( x/2 = 12/2 = 6 \\).\n\nThe total revenue from the small stuffed animals is \\( 40 \\times 12 = 480 \\) dollars.\nThe total revenue from the large stuffed animals is \\( 120 \\times 6 = 720 \\) dollars.\n\nAdding both, we get \\( 480 + 720 = 1200 \\) dollars, which matches the given total revenue.\n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
