You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

We are provided with the information to break down the problem step-by-step as follows:\n\n1. Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday (given).\n2. Determine the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday (`2/5` times more than Monday).\n3. Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday by using time spent as a reference.\n4. Calculate how many more times as long the number of articles on Wednesday is compared to Tuesday.\n\nHere's how we'll solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Monday Articles**:  \n   Monday's articles = 5  \n\n2. **Tuesday Articles**:  \n   Tuesday's articles = Monday articles + \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of Monday articles  \n   This can be calculated as follows:  \n   Tuesday articles = \\(5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5\\)\n\n3. **Total hours used to calculate Wednesday's articles**:  \n   Time spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday = \n   \\((5 + \\left(5 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5\\right)) \\times 4\\)\n   \n   From this, calculate the remaining hours spent on Wednesday:  \n   Wednesday hours = 104 - hours spent on Monday and Tuesday\n\n4. **Wednesday Articles**:  \n   Number of articles written on Wednesday = Wednesday hours / 4\n\n5. **Calculate the number of times as many articles on Wednesday compared to Tuesday**.\n\nLet's use Python to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Variables\nmonday_articles = 5\ntuesday_articles = monday_articles + Rational(2, 5) * monday_articles\ntotal_hours = 104\n\n# Calculate time spent on Monday and Tuesday\nmonday_hours = monday_articles * 4\ntuesday_hours = tuesday_articles * 4\n\n# Calculate remaining hours (Wednesday)\nwednesday_hours = total_hours - (monday_hours + tuesday_hours)\nwednesday_articles = wednesday_hours / 4\n\n# Find the ratio of Wednesday articles to Tuesday's articles\nratio = wednesday_articles / tuesday_articles\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Ratio of Wednesday articles to Tuesday's articles: {ratio}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute the code and determine the ratio of articles written on Wednesday compared to Tuesday."
