You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent on each activity and then find the total time he spent on vacation. From there, we can determine how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n### Key idea:\n\nWe'll use the provided information to find the total time John spent and then calculate the time spent sightseeing, which makes up 40% of his total time.\n\n#### Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Determine the time spent on each activity:\n   - Boating: 6.6 hours\n   - Swimming: \\( \\frac{6.6}{2} = 3.3 \\) hours\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows Ã— 2.5 hours each = 7.5 hours\n\n2. Calculate the total time spent on the recorded activities.\n3. Using the information that watching shows was 30% of the total time, calculate the total time John spent on vacation.\n4. From the total time, calculate 40% to find the sightseeing time.\n\n#### Queries:\n\n1. Calculate the total time from the watching shows percentage.\n2. Calculate the sightseeing time percentage from the total time.\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Given information\nboating_time = 6.6  # hours\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2  # hours\nshow_time = 3 * 2.5  # 3 shows, 2.5 hours each\nshow_time_percent = 0.3\nsightseeing_percent = 0.4\n\n# Total time spend equation\ntotal_time = symbols('total_time')\nequation = Eq(show_time, show_time_percent * total_time)\n\n# Solve for total time\ntotal_time_value = solve(equation, total_time)[0]\n\n# Calculate time spent sightseeing\nsightseeing_time = sightseeing_percent * total_time_value\n\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the time John spent sightseeing."
