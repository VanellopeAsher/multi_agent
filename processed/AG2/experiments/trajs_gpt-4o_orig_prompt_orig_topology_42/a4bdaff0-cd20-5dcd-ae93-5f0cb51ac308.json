You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

We then need to calculate the total yearly payment based on this monthly payment.\n\nWe'll use Python to perform the calculations as it is straightforward arithmetic and can be directly computed using Python's arithmetic operations.\n\nKey Idea:\n- Calculate 50% more than the individual minimum payments.\n- Sum these amounts to find the total monthly payment.\n- Multiply the monthly payment by 12 to find the yearly payment.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this:\n\n```python\n# Define the minimum payments\nstudent_loans_min = 3000\ncredit_card_min = 2000\nmortgage_min = 5000\n\n# Calculate 50% more than the minimum for each debt\nstudent_loans_payment = student_loans_min * 1.5\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min * 1.5\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min * 1.5\n\n# Calculate total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loans_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate total yearly payment\ntotal_yearly_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result as a fraction\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(\"Total Yearly Payment:\", Rational(total_yearly_payment))\n```\n\nRun this program, and you'll get the total amount Jessica has to pay in a year formatted as a fraction."
