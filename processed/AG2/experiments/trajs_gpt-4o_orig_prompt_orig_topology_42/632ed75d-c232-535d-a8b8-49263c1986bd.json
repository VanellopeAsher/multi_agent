      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe key idea here is that we have two aircraft, and we know the second aircraft's flights are related to the first aircraft's flights in a specific way.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Identify the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of flights made by the first aircraft daily.\n\n2. **Relate the Flights:**\n   - The second aircraft flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the first aircraft's total flights. Thus, we have:\n     \\[\n     44 = \\frac{1}{2}x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Flights for the First Aircraft:**\n   - Solve the equation for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 44 \\times 2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Distribution of Flights for the First Aircraft:**\n   - The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flights to Greece} = \\frac{3}{4}x\n     \\]\n   - The rest of the flights are divided equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights are:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Flights} = x - \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{1}{4}x\n     \\]\n   - Flights to France:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flights to France} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4}x = \\frac{1}{8}x\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compute the Number of Flights to France:**\n   - Substitute the value of \\( x \\) into the equation for flights to France.\n\nLet's do these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Define x\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Given equation for total flights by first aircraft\nequation = Eq(44, Rational(1, 2) * x)\n\n# Solve for x (total flights by first aircraft)\ntotal_flights_first_aircraft = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate flights to France (1/8 of total flights by first aircraft)\nflights_to_France = Rational(1, 8) * total_flights_first_aircraft\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is: {flights_to_France}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you will find the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France. From the math, the value will be \\(\\frac{1}{8} \\times 88 = 11\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{11}\\) daily flights to France."
