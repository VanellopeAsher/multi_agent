You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the conditions given for when Emil is 26. Let's use a math-based reasoning approach here.\n\n**Steps to solve the problem:**\n\n1. Define the current age of Emil as \\( E \\). We know Emil is 21 years old now, so \\( E = 21 \\).\n\n2. Define the current age of Emil's dad as \\( D \\).\n\n3. Define the current age of Emil's brother as \\( B \\).\n\n4. According to the problem:\n   - When Emil is 26, his age should be half of his dad's age. Therefore, \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \\). \n   - At the same time, Emil's age should be twice his brother's age. Therefore, \\( 26 = 2 \\times (B + 5) \\).\n\nLet's set up the equations and solve them:\n\n### Equations:\n1. \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \\)\n2. \\( 26 = 2 \\times (B + 5) \\)\n\nNow we solve these equations for \\( D \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n### Solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nD, B = symbols('D B', integer=True)\n\n# Equation 1: Emil will be half his dad's age when he is 26\neq1 = Eq(26, 1/2 * (D + 5))\n\n# Equation 2: Emil will be twice his brother's age when he is 26\neq2 = Eq(26, 2 * (B + 5))\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (D, B))\n\n# Extracting current ages of Emil's dad and brother\ncurrent_dad_age = solution[D]\ncurrent_brother_age = solution[B]\n\n# Calculate the sum of their current ages\nsum_of_ages = current_dad_age + current_brother_age\n\n# Print the result\nprint(current_dad_age, current_brother_age, sum_of_ages)\n```\n\nThe key idea here is formulating the problem in terms of algebraic equations where we use the future age conditions for Emil to express the relationships with his dad's and brother's ages. Let's calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother using the code above."
