You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.

Calculate the total cost for the aquarium.\n2. Calculate the total cost for the bags of rocks.\n3. Calculate the total cost for the pieces of coral.\n4. Calculate the cost of the fish food.\n5. Sum up all individual costs to get the total expenditure.\n\nThis problem can be directly handled with calculations in Python, so I'll write a program to compute the total cost.\n\n```python\n# Prices and quantities\naquarium_cost = 10.00\nbag_of_rocks_cost = 2.50\nnumber_of_bags_of_rocks = 2\npiece_of_coral_cost = 2.00\nnumber_of_pieces_of_coral = 3\nfish_food_cost = 2.00\n\n# Calculating total costs\ntotal_cost_of_rocks = bag_of_rocks_cost * number_of_bags_of_rocks\ntotal_cost_of_coral = piece_of_coral_cost * number_of_pieces_of_coral\ntotal_cost = aquarium_cost + total_cost_of_rocks + total_cost_of_coral + fish_food_cost\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(\"Total cost spent: ${}\".format(total_cost))\n```\n\nPlease execute this code to find out how much Scarlett spent."
