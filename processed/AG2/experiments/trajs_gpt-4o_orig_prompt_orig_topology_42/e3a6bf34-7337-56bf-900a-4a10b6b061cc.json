You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.

Calculate the number of yellow ties he bought: \n   - He spent $300 on yellow ties that cost $30 each.\n   - Number of yellow ties = Total spent on yellow ties / Cost per yellow tie.\n\n2. Determine how much the green ties cost:\n   - Green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties.\n   - Cost of a green tie = Cost of a yellow tie + 70% of the cost of a yellow tie.\n\n3. Calculate how many green ties he can buy:\n   - He buys the same number of green ties as yellow ties.\n\n4. Calculate costs of other ties (red and blue ties):\n   - Assume the cost of red and blue ties is similar, as long as their quantities are specified.\n\n5. Compute the total spent on all ties.\n\nLet's go through these steps using Python.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the number of yellow ties\ncost_yellow_tie = 30\ntotal_spent_yellow = 300\nnum_yellow_ties = total_spent_yellow / cost_yellow_tie\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the cost of a green tie\ncost_green_tie = cost_yellow_tie * (1 + 0.7)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the cost for green ties\ntotal_spent_green = num_yellow_ties * cost_green_tie\n\n# Step 4: Calculate total amount spent on all ties\ntotal_spent_on_ties = total_spent_yellow + total_spent_green\n\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Output the total spent on ties in fraction/radical form\n# Wrap the final answer in print and use exact value with sympy\nprint(\"Total spent on ties:\", Rational(total_spent_on_ties))\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you'll find that the total amount spent on ties, including both yellow and green ties, is calculated based on the given conditions: \n\n- John spent $300 on yellow ties.\n- The cost of each green tie is 70% more than that of a yellow tie.\n\nPlease run the code to get the exact total cost in a precise format."
