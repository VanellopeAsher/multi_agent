You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours.

First, calculate Bruce's work hours for each day:\n   - Tuesday: 5 hours\n   - Wednesday: Double of Tuesday's hours\n   - Thursday: Two hours less than Wednesday's hours\n\n2. Sum up the hours for all three days.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the hours worked on each day\ntuesday_hours = 5\nwednesday_hours = 2 * tuesday_hours\nthursday_hours = wednesday_hours - 2\n\n# Calculate the total hours worked over the three days\ntotal_hours = tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nBy running this code, you'll find the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days."
