You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine Mark's initial weight before he fell ill. We can use a straightforward calculation based on his weight loss and gain over time. We will set up an equation that represents his weight changes over the months.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.\n2. He then gained 5 pounds per month for 2 months.\n3. His final weight after recovery was 70 pounds.\n\nTo find his initial weight, we can reverse the weight changes:\n\n- During the 3 months of illness, Mark lost a total of \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) pounds.\n- During the 2 months of recovery, he regained \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) pounds.\n\nWe can express his initial weight \\(x\\) as follows:\n\n1. Start with the initial weight \\(x\\).\n2. Subtract 30 pounds (weight lost during illness) from \\(x\\).\n3. Add 10 pounds (weight regained during recovery) to the result from step 2.\n4. This is equal to his final weight of 70 pounds.\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[\nx - 30 + 10 = 70\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx - 20 = 70\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 70 + 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 90\n\\]\n\nLet's implement this calculation using Python to confirm our result:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the initial weight\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Setup the equation\nequation = Eq(x - 30 + 10, 70)\n\n# Solve the equation\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Display the result in a fraction form\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nWhen you run the code, it should confirm that the initial weight was \\(\\boxed{90}\\) pounds."
