You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed.

Calculate the area of one piece of fabric needed for the comforter, considering it needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than Jim's bed.\n2. Calculate the area of the duvet cover.\n3. Sum up the areas to find the total square feet of fabric needed.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary packages\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Dimensions of the bed\nbed_length = 6  # in feet\nbed_width = 8   # in feet\n\n# Dimensions of the fabric for the comforter (2 feet longer and 2 feet wider)\nfabric_length = bed_length + 2\nfabric_width = bed_width + 2\n\n# Area of one piece of fabric for the comforter\ncomforter_area = fabric_length * fabric_width\n\n# There are 2 pieces of fabric needed for the comforter\ntotal_comforter_area = 2 * comforter_area\n\n# Dimensions of the duvet cover\nduvet_length = 9  # in feet\nduvet_width = 11  # in feet\n\n# Area of the duvet cover\nduvet_area = duvet_length * duvet_width\n\n# Total fabric needed\ntotal_fabric_area = total_comforter_area + duvet_area\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Total square feet of fabric needed: {total_fabric_area}\")\n```\n\nExecute this code to find the total square feet of fabric that Jim needs to purchase."
