You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to consider the angular change in the sun's position above the horizon as described, and then calculate the total angle from the ground to the sun after the specified time.\n\n### Key Idea:\n1. We start with the initial angle from the ground, which is 32 degrees.\n2. The sun moves upward at 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours. Therefore, during this time, the sun will move:\n   \\[\n   5 \\, \\text{degrees/hour} \\times 10 \\, \\text{hours} = 50 \\, \\text{degrees}\n   \\]\n3. For the next 2 hours, the sun moves at 3 degrees per hour. This results in:\n   \\[\n   3 \\, \\text{degrees/hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 6 \\, \\text{degrees}\n   \\]\n4. The total change in angle over the 12 hours is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\, \\text{degrees} + 6 \\, \\text{degrees} = 56 \\, \\text{degrees}\n   \\]\n5. Add this change to the initial angle to get the final angle from the ground to the sun:\n   \\[\n   32 \\, \\text{degrees} + 56 \\, \\text{degrees} = 88 \\, \\text{degrees}\n   \\]\n\nLet's write the Python code to verify this:\n\n```python\n# Initial angle from the ground\ninitial_angle = 32\n\n# Sun movement for the first 10 hours\nsun_move_first_10_hours = 5 * 10\n\n# Sun movement for the next 2 hours\nsun_move_next_2_hours = 3 * 2\n\n# Total sun movement\ntotal_sun_movement = sun_move_first_10_hours + sun_move_next_2_hours\n\n# Final angle from the ground\nfinal_angle = initial_angle + total_sun_movement\n\n# Print the result in fraction form if needed (not really necessary here as it's a whole number)\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(Rational(final_angle))\n```\n\nWhen you run the above code, you will find that the final angle from the ground to the sun is \\(\\boxed{88}\\) degrees."
