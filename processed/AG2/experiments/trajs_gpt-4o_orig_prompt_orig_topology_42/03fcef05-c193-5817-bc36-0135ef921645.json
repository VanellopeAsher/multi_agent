You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRaymond initially had $2100.

This problem can be handled in a straightforward manner using direct arithmetic operations.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1. Start with the initial amount of money Raymond had.\n2. Add the amount of money he saved.\n3. Subtract the amount spent on the comic book.\n4. Subtract the amount spent on the puzzle.\n5. Calculate the remaining amount.\n\nSince the problem is mostly arithmetic, we'll write a simple Python program to calculate the result.\n\n```python\n# Initial amount Raymond had\ninitial_money = 2100\n\n# Amount saved\nsaved_money = 1100\n\n# Amount spent on comic book\ncomic_book_cost = 500\n\n# Amount spent on puzzle\npuzzle_cost = 1900\n\n# Calculate the amount left\nremaining_money = initial_money + saved_money - comic_book_cost - puzzle_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\nNow the Python code will compute the remaining money Raymond has."
