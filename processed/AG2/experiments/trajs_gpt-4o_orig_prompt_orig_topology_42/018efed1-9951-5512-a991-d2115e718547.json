You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.

We will calculate how much Gerald earned by working for an entire week and then find out how much he spent given how much he saved.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week.\n2. Subtract the amount he saved from his total earnings to find out how much he spent.\n\n```python\n# Gerald's daily earnings\ndaily_earnings = 30\n\n# Number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Calculate total earnings in a week\ntotal_earnings = daily_earnings * days_in_week\n\n# Amount Gerald saved\nsaved_amount = 110\n\n# Calculate the amount spent\namount_spent = total_earnings - saved_amount\n\n# Print the amount spent\nprint(amount_spent)\n```\n\nNow, I'll run this code.
