You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 0.1 times of one thousand years old.

This means that:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Peter's age} + \\text{Paul's age} + \\text{Jean's age} = 0.1 \\times 1000 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul's age is 0.1 times one hundred years older than John's age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Paul's age} = 0.1 \\times 100 + \\text{John's age} = 10 + \\text{John's age}\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul’s and John’s ages:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Peter's age} = \\text{Paul's age} + \\text{John's age}\n   \\]\n\nLet's represent the ages of Paul and John as variables, and then substitute these into the given equations to solve for Peter's age. We'll use Python to calculate this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nPeter, Paul, Jean, John = symbols('Peter Paul Jean John', positive=True)\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\neq1 = Peter + Paul + Jean - 100  # combined age is 100\neq2 = Paul - (10 + John)         # Paul's age = 10 + John's age\neq3 = Peter - (Paul + John)      # Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (Peter, Paul, Jean, John))\n\n# Output the solution for Peter's age\nprint(solution[Peter])\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we'll get the age of Peter.
