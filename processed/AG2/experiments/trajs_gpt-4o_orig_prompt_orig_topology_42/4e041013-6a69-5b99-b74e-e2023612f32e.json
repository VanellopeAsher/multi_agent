You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is arranging tulips in his garden.

We'll solve this with Python code directly (Case 1).\n\n1. Calculate the number of rows needed for the red tulips by dividing the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row.\n2. Calculate the number of rows needed for the blue tulips by dividing the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row.\n3. Sum the rows from the two different calculations to get the total number of rows of tulips that Jackson will plant.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Import the fraction utility for better formatting long division results, if needed.\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Given data\ntotal_red_tulips = 36\nred_tulips_per_row = 6\ntotal_blue_tulips = 24\nblue_tulips_per_row = 8\n\n# Calculate the number of rows for each type of tulip\nrows_for_red_tulips = total_red_tulips // red_tulips_per_row\nrows_for_blue_tulips = total_blue_tulips // blue_tulips_per_row\n\n# Total rows of tulips\ntotal_rows = rows_for_red_tulips + rows_for_blue_tulips\n\n# Print the result in the desired format\nprint(\"The total number of rows Jackson will plant is:\", total_rows)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed, it will give us the total number of rows of tulips to be planted."
