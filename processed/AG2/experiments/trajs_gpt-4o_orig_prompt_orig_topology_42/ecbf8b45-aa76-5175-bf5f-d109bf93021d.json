You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.

Calculate the total number of balloons originally, which is the number of packs multiplied by the number of balloons per pack.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end to find out how many were thrown.\n\nLet's solve this using Python.\n\n```python\n# Given data\nballoons_per_pack = 30\npacks_filled = 'unknown'\nballoons_left = 12\n\n# Let x be the number of packs filled\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable and equation\nx = symbols('x')\nequation = Eq(x * balloons_per_pack - balloons_left, x * balloons_per_pack - (x * balloons_per_pack - balloons_left))\n\n# Solve for the number of balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = x * balloons_per_pack - balloons_left\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nPlease note that we currently don't have the number of packs filled (`packs_filled`), so replace 'unknown' with the actual number of packs filled when available to solve it completely. Let me know how many packs were filled, and I can calculate it precisely for you."

      "content": "Great! Now that we know the total number of balloons thrown is given by the expression \\(30x - 12\\), we just need the number of packs filled to compute the exact number of balloons thrown. Let's finalize this with one assumption: if we assume \\( x \\) is the number of packs filled, this expression tells us that:\n\n1. For each pack filled, there are 30 balloons.\n2. Subtract 12 balloons for the ones remaining (not thrown).\n\nGiven this, if you provide the number of packs filled, you can substitute it into the expression \\(30x - 12\\) to get the exact number of balloons thrown. If you say, for example, there were 5 packs filled, you would substitute that in to get the total balloons thrown:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the number of balloons thrown for a given number of packs\n# Replace `n` with the actual number of packs filled.\nn = 5  # for example\nballoons_thrown = 30 * n - 12\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nJust adjust `n` to the correct number of packs filled, and run the code to get the answer! Once you provide me with the number of packs, I can give you the final \\(\\boxed{\\text{answer}}\\)."
