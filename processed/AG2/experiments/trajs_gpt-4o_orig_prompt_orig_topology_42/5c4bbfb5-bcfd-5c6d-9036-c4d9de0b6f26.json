Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

We'll break it down step-by-step, calculating the individual costs based on the relationships provided, and finally sum them up to get the total cost.\n\n### Key Idea\n\nCase 1: The problem involves direct calculations, so we'll write a Python program to compute the required values.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of one pack of bacon.\n2. Use this to find the cost of one packet of chicken.\n3. Calculate the cost of the strawberries and apples.\n4. Find the total cost of all items.\n5. Subtract the total cost from her budget to find the remaining money.\n\nLet's code it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the cost of one pack of bacon.\n# Total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.5\ncost_of_bacon = Rational('10.5') / 5\n\n# Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\ncost_of_chicken = 2 * cost_of_bacon\n\n# Cost of 6 packets of chicken\ntotal_cost_chicken = 6 * cost_of_chicken\n\n# Each pack of strawberries costs $4.5\ncost_of_strawberries = Rational('4.5')\n\n# Cost of 3 packs of strawberries\ntotal_cost_strawberries = 3 * cost_of_strawberries\n\n# Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.\ncost_of_apples = cost_of_strawberries / 2\n\n# Cost of 7 packs of apples\ntotal_cost_apples = 7 * cost_of_apples\n\n# Total cost of all items\ntotal_cost = (10.5 + total_cost_chicken + total_cost_strawberries + total_cost_apples)\n\n# Kelly's budget is $65\nbudget = 65\n\n# Remaining money in budget\nremaining_money = budget - total_cost\n\n# Print the remaining money in dollars\nprint(f\"The remaining money in Kelly's budget is: ${remaining_money}\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total cost of Kelly's groceries and prints the amount of money she has left in her budget in dollars."
