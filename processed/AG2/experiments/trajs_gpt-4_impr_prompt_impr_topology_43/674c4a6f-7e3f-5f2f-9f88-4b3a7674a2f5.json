The grades of the tests were given as [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]. The average grade is calculated by adding up the scores and then dividing by the number of tests.\n\nAgent Problem Solver executed this code and got the output: 84.2\n\nUpon reviewing the provided data and the proposed solutions, I can verify that the average calculation has been correctly performed. No assumptions were made and the entire solution is based on the explicitly given variables in the problem statement. Therefore, the final solution to the problem \"What is Wilson's current math grade?\" is 84.2.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{84.2}"
