We then take this monthly total and multiply by 12 to find out the annual total. \n\nHere are the steps:\n1. Calculate the total minimum required payment required each month. This is equal to the sum of the student loan minimum payment, credit card minimum payment, and mortgage minimum payment.\n2. Calculate the amount Jessica wants to pay, which is 50% more than the required minimum monthly payment. To find this, multiply the monthly minimum requirement by 50%, then add this amount to the total minimum monthly payment.\n3. To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, multiply the monthly amount from step 2 by 12. \n\nAfter these steps, we will get the amount Jessica pays in a year."

Then compute the monthly total Jessica willing to pay by adding 50% of the total monthly minimum amount to the total monthly minimum amount. \n\nAfter calculating the amount payable per month, the total amount payable in a year would be the monthly payable amount multiplied by a year's 12 months.\n\nLet's go ahead with the computation."
