      "content": "Here's how we calculate the total amount Scarlett spent.\n\n1. Start from the cost of the fish tank, which is $10.00.\n\n2. Scarlett bought two packets of stones that cost $2.50 each. Thus, the cost for the stones is 2 packets * $2.50/packet = $5.00.\n\n3. She also bought three coral pieces at $2.00 each. Therefore, the cost for the coral pieces is 3 pieces * $2.00/piece = $6.00.\n\n4. Scarlett then bought 20 fish at a price of $0.50 each. Hence, the total cost for the fish is 20 fish * $0.50/fish = $10.00.\n\n5. The cost of the fish food is $2.00.\n\n6. To calculate the total amount Scarlett spent, we add up all the amounts. \n    Thus, Total cost = cost of the fish tank + cost of the stones + cost of the corals + cost of the fish + cost of the fish food.\n    = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00\n\nWe can therefore conclude that Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
