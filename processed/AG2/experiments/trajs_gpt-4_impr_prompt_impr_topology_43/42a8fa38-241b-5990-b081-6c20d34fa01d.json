She purchased 20 tomato seed packets and 80 celery seed packets for this purpose. Given that a tomato seed packet is priced at $40 and a celery seed packet is priced at $30, what is the total amount of money she spent on purchasing the seeds?",

Here are step-by-step calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of tomato seed packets: \n   This can be done by multiplying the number of tomato seed packets (20) by the cost of a tomato seed packet ($40). \n\n2. Calculate the cost of celery seed packets: \n   Multiply the number of celery seed packets (80) by the cost of a celery seed packet ($30). \n\n3.

Given the quantities of seed packets purchased and their respective prices, the final total amount spent is correctly calculated to be $3200. We could also use numpy to compute the total cost but in this case, it is an overkill. Python's built-in arithmetics are simpler and sufficient for this kind of problem.
