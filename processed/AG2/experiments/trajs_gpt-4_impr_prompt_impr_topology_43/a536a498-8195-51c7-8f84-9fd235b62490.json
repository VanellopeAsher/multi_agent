If Kelly said that Courtney's count was overstated by 20%, it means that Courtney's reported attendance was 120% of the actual attendance.\n   \n2. Since the actual attendance is known (40 people), we can find out what the reported attendance by Courtney was using this equation:\n\n    Reported Attendance (according to Courtney) = Actual Attendance (according to Kelly) * 120/100\n\nThis calculation will give you the number of people in the audience according to Courtney's count. \n\nSo, the suggested solution to this problem is to compute the result of the equation above.

We've truly shown once again the effectiveness of combining our abilities. I will provide synthesis for our solution:\n\nCourtney reported the audience size at a concert to be 48 people. However, Kelly pointed out that this count was in fact overstated by 20%, hence the real number of attendees was smaller. According to Kelly, the actual audience size was 40 people. We have confirmed these claims through mathematical calculation, proving the number of people at the concert according to Courtney was indeed 48."
