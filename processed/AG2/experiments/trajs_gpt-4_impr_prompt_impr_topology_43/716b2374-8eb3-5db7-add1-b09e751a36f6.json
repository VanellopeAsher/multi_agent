  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

      "content": "In order to determine the cost of each pack of cloths, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. From the problem, we already know Kim has 3 clients and is expecting 5 more clients. This totals 8 clients.\n2. We also know that each client's home requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Therefore, for 8 homes, 16 (2*8) bottles of bleach and 8 packs of cloths will be required.\n3. We know each bottle of bleach costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of bleach for 8 homes would be $32 (16 bottles * $2 per bottle).\n4. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, then the total weekly expenses would be $72 ($92 total income - $20 profit).\n5. Subtract the cost of bleach from the total expenses to find out the total cost of cloths. This would be $40 ($72 total weekly expenses - $32 total bleach cost).\n6. To find out the cost of each pack of cloths, divide the total cost of cloths by the number of packs. This is the cost of each pack of cloths. \n\nAbove steps will provide the solution to the problem."

We can solve the task by following the exact same steps. \n\nIn Step 1, we calculate the total number of clients. \nIn Step 2, we calculate the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths needed. \nIn Step 3, we calculate the total cost of bleach for all clients. \nIn Step 4, we calculate the total expenses by subtracting the profit from the total income. \nIn the next step, Step 5, we find out the total cost of cloths by subtracting the cost of bleach from the total expenses. \nAnd finally, in Step 6, we find out the cost of each pack of cloths by dividing the total cost of cloths by the total number of packs. \n\nLet's put this into Python code and find the cost of each pack of cloths."
