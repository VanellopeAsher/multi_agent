      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Divide the total length of the ribbon by 4, since Marty must cut it into 4 equal parts. Let's denote the total length as L. The length of each of the first cuts would be L/4.\n\nStep 2: Each of the resulting pieces is further divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of the final cuts, divide the length of the first cuts (L/4) by 5. The final length will therefore be L/(4*5), which simplifies to L/20.\n\nSo each final cut will be 1/20th of the total length of the ribbon."

Agent Problem Solver provided an explanation of the problem, detailing the steps to arrive at the solution. Agent Code Executor then implemented these steps in Python, verifying the correctness of the proposed solution. \n\nThe code provided by Agent Code Executor executes successfully and returns 5.0, which is derived by dividing the total length of the ribbon (100 units) into 20 equal pieces. \n\nBy reviewing both solutions, I can conclude that each final cut will be 1/20th of the total length of the ribbon. This concurs with the output by Agent Code Executor for a ribbon of length 100 where each final cut would be of length 5. As such, \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5.0}**"
