Given that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, we can denote the amount of cards PJ has as X, and therefore, the amount that Smendrick has as 3X.\n   \n2. Since Becca has 0.12 hundred more than Smendrick, the amount of cards Becca has can be denoted as 3X + 0.12.\n\n3. The total amount of cards, which is 3.41 hundred, is the sum of the amount of cards each of them have, therefore, we can build the following equation:\n\n    X + 3X + (3X + 0.12) = 3.41\n    \nLet's solve this equation."
