Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

So in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 films.\n\n4. As there are 4 weeks in a month, they would therefore watch 6 * 4 = 24 films in 4 weeks.\n\nHence, the total number of films Jill and her friends can view over a period of 4 weeks is 24."
