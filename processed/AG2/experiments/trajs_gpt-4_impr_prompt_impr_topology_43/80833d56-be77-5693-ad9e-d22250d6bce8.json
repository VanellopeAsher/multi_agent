Determine the total time John runs in a week:\n\n    - On the first day, he runs 10 hours\n    - For the next two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours each day\n    - Therefore, the total time he runs in a week is 10 hours (first day) + 5 hours (second day) + 5 hours (third day) = 20 hours\n\n2. Determine the total distance he runs in a week, which is given as 100 miles.\n\n3. Compute his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. Speed = distance/time\n\n4. So, the speed would be 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles/hour."

Considering these results, I can confidently conclude that John runs at an average speed of 5 miles per hour."

Calculate how much time John spends running on the second and third day by halving the time he spends on the first day: 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours/day.\n2. Sum up the total time John spends running per week: 10 hours (first day) + 5 hours (second day) + 5 hours (third day) = 20 hours.\n3. Use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time: speed = 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles per hour.\n\nIn our discussion, I agree with Agent Problem Solver's solution, which uses the same formulas and calculation methods. The codes generated by Agent Code Executor to compute John's running speed also give the same result of 5 miles per hour. This confirms that our solution is correct."
