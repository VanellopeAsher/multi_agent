Since lawyer donated $6600 in total, it means the total amount collected from everyone else (before the lawyer's donation) was $6600 / 3 = $2200.\n\nStep 3: We know that total which Walter collected before the lawyer's contribution was $2000. So, the contribution from his friend will be the difference between total (before the lawyer's donation) and the total from neighbours and the online fund, which is $2200-$2000= $200.\n\nHence, his friend gave him $200."

So, by dividing lawyer's contribution by 3 we will get total amount collected before lawyer's contribution.\nFinally, the friend's contribution will be the difference between total amount collected before lawyer's contribution and amount collected from neighbours and the online fund. \n\nLet's calculate this."
