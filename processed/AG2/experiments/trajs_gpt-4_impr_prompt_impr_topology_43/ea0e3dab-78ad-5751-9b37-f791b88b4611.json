Given the streaming service company charges $200 per month, and there are 6 months in the first half of the year:\nTotal Cost first half = Charge per month * number of months\n                                   = $200 * 6\n                            \nStep 2: Calculate the new monthly charge for the second half of the year. From the problem, this charge is 15% less than the original amount per month. So,\nNew monthly charge = original monthly charge - 0.15* original monthly charge\n                        \nStep 3: Compute the total cost for the second half of the year:\nTotal cost Second half = New monthly charge * number of months\n                                    \nStep 4: Sum up the total costs of both halves to get the total amount:\n\nTotal amount paid = Total cost first half + Total cost second half"

The calculation of the total cost is as follows:\n\n   - First half of the year: $200 per month * 6 months = $1200 \n   - Second half of the year: 85% (100% -15%) of $200 per month * 6 months = $1020\n   - Add these two: $1200 + $1020 = $2220\n\nTherefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $2220. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2220}**."
