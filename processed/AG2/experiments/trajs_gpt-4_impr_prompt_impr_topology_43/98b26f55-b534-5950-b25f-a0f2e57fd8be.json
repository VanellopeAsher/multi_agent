He calculated the total hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week by multiplying the number of hours he plays daily (2 hours) by 7 (the number of days in a week). He then multiplied the total number of hours by Jordan's hourly wage ($10) to get the total potential earnings for a week. The result was $140. Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in a week if he spent his video game time working instead. The code calculated it correctly with the same result.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 140."
