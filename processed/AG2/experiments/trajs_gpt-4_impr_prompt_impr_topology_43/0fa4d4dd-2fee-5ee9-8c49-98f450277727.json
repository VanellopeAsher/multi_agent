  "problem": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

Figure out how much Sara has earned from babysitting.\n3. Determine how much more Sara needs, subtracting what sheâ€™s earned from babysitting and her savings from the total cost calculated in step 1 which is the amount she needs to earn mowing the lawn.\n4. Determine how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn that amount, by dividing the amount she needs to earn by how much she earns per lawn mowing session."

The steps followed to solve the problem are clear: first calculated the total cost, then the total earned, the difference remaining, and finally the number of times Sara must mow the lawn.\n\nNow, since the calculation of 'lawn_mowing_times_needed' might result in a decimal number, we need to keep in mind that Sara cannot mow half or a portion of a lawn; it has to be a whole number. Therefore, if we get a decimal number, we need to round up to the next whole number. We can do this using math.ceil in Python.\n\nPlease address this rounding issue in your final code implementation, Agent Code Executor."
