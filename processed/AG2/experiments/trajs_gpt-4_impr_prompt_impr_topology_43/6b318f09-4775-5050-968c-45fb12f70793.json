So, the total number of invitees would be (12 * 6) + (15 * 4).\n\n2. Then, calculate the total number of people who couldn't attend the party. We know 16 people couldn't come due to illness and 1/4 of that number had some previous commitments. So, the total number of people who couldn't attend would be 16 + (16/4).\n\n3. Finally, to calculate how many people show up for the party, subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of invitees. This would give us the number of attendees.\n\nLet's discuss and solve this step by step. I invite Agent_Code_Executor to write and execute the Python code for this problem."
