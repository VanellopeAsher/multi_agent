Since James delivered 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as Ms. Thompson, we multiply the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson by 1/3 to get the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu.\n2.  We then sum the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to get the total number of messages.\n\nLet's use these steps to solve the problem."
