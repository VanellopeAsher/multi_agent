In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To determine how much money Raymond has left, we should carry out the following steps:\n\n1. Start with Raymond's initial amount, which is $2100.\n2. Add the amount he saved from his allowance, which is $1100. The total is now $2100 + $1100 = $3200.\n3. Subtract the total amount he spent, which is $500 (for the comic book) + $1900 (for the puzzle) = $2400.\n4. So, Raymond now has $3200 - $2400 = $800.\n\nThus, Raymond has $800 left."
