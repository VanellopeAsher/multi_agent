      "content": "Here is my solution step by step:\n\n1. On Tuesday, the water level rose by 7 feet. Therefore, the total depth on Tuesday was 17 feet (Monday's level) + 7 feet = 24 feet.\n\n2. On Wednesday, the water level decreased to two-thirds of Tuesday's depth. So, on Wednesday, the water depth is 2/3 * 24 feet = 16 feet.\n\nSo, the water depth is 16 feet on Wednesday."
