      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total payment Stephen has made to his sister in the 11 months and then calculate what is left to pay including his 2% interest.\n\nHere are the steps needed to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the payment that Stephen makes in the first 11 months. This is done by multiplying the amount he pays each month ($25) by the number of months (11). \n\n2. Subtract this total from the initial amount Stephen owed his sister ($300) to find out what Stephen still owes before his final payment.\n\n3. Calculate the 2% interest on the initial borrowed amount ($300).\n\n4. Add the remaining owed amount and the interest to find out how much Stephen has to pay his sister in the 12th month.\n\nLet's calculate this without the expenses Stephen makes for his coin collection hobby since we are asked to find what he will pay his sister excluding his coin purchases."
