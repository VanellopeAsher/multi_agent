  "problem": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?",

Multiply the number of packs of strawberry gum (2 packs) by the cost of one pack of strawberry gum ($2), which comes to $4. \n2. Add the cost of one pack of grape gum to the total, which is $2. The total is now $6. \n3. Calculate the cost of one pack of green apple gum, which is half the cost of one pack of grape gum, so it is $1. \n4. Then add the cost of this pack to the total. The total sum is $7.\n\nSince these calculations match the problem statement without making any assumptions and were validated by the python code execution, I can confidently affirm that Suzie paid $7 in all for the gum. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{7}"
