      "content": "Sure. Here is how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Initialize the total number of boxes and amount of oranges per box: Mrs. Harrington bought a dozen (12) boxes of oranges, and each box has 20 oranges.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of oranges: Multiply the number of boxes by the amount of oranges per box to get the total amount of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.\n\n3. Calculate the number of gifted oranges: Mrs. Harrington gifted her mother and her sibling two boxes each, meaning she gave away 4 boxes in total. Multiply the number of gifted boxes by the amount of oranges per box to find out the number of oranges she gave away.\n\n4. Determine the total number of remaining oranges: Subtract the number of gifted oranges from the total initial amount of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.\n\n5. Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington retained for herself: She kept a quarter of the remaining oranges, therefore, multiply total remaining oranges by a quarter (0.25).\n\n6. Determine the number of oranges she sold: Subtract the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself from total remaining oranges after she gave gifts. This will give us the number of oranges that she sold.\n\nThe solution to find the number of oranges she sold will be given by the formula:  \n`oranges_sold = total_oranges - gifted_oranges - retained_oranges`  \n\nWe can now substitute the numbers into this formula to find the exact amount."
