      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow the steps below:\n\n1. For each type of item, we multiply the price per item by the quantity Marcus ordered to get the total price for that item type. This is done as follows:\n     - 5 croissants at $3.50 apiece => `5 * 3.50 = 17.50`\n     - 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each => `4 * 2.50 = 10.00`\n     - 3 mini quiches for $4.50 apiece => `3 * 4.50 = 13.50`\n     - 13 blueberry muffins at $1.50 each => `13 * 1.5 = 19.50`\n2. Next, we sum the total cost for all items to get the gross total. This is done as follows: \n     - Gross Total =  `17.50 + 10.00 + 13.50 + 19.50 = 60.50`\n3. Then, we calculate the discount by multiplying the Gross Total by the discount rate. Since the discount is 10%, it will be calculated as follows: \n     - Discount = `Gross Total * 10 / 100 = 6.05`\n4. Finally, to get the final cost, we subtract the Discount from the Gross Total. The final cost would therefore be:\n     - Final Cost = `Gross Total - Discount = 60.50 - 6.05 = 54.45`\n\nThus, Marcus' total bill amount is $54.45."

Apply the loyalty discount to the subtotal, effectively reducing it by 10%.\n5.

Agent_Problem_Solver methodically calculated the total cost for each type of pastry, added these up to get a gross total, applied the 10% discount, and determined the final cost.\n\n2. Agent_Code_Executor did the same, by writing a simple script in Python.
