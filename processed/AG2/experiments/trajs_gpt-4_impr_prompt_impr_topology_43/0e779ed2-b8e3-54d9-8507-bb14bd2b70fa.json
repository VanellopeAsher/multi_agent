In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

So multiply the age of the younger brother by 2.\nStep 4: Combine the ages.\n    Add the total ages of the sisters (remember, there are three with the same age) and the ages of the two brothers together.\nThis will give the total age of all the five siblings."

This is calculated as 3/5 * 20 years.\nThe third step is to calculate the age of the older brother. According to the task, the older brother is twice as old as the younger one.\nThe final step is to sum all these ages together which provides the total age of all five siblings.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the age of the sisters\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10\n# Calculate the age of the younger brother\nyounger_brother_age = 3/5 * 20\n# Calculate the age of the older brother\nolder_brother_age = younger_brother_age * 2\n# Calculate the total age\ntotal_age = sister_age * 3 + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

All given variables in the problem statement have been used appropriately. The calculation of the age of the sisters, younger brother, and older brother was done accurately, and the total age calculation also appears to be correct. Therefore, the solution of Agent Problem Solver and the resultant output by Agent Code Executor of 84.0 match, confirming the accuracy of the solution. As such, the total age of all these siblings is 84.0 years.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{84.0}**."
