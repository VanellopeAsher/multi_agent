In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate the cost of the burgers by multiplying 5 (the number of hamburgers) by $4 (the price per burger).\n2.  Calculate the cost of the French fries by multiplying 10 (the number of fries packs) by $0.30 (the price per fries pack).\n3.  Compute the overall cost of the items Carly bought by adding the price of the burgers and the price of the fries. \n4.  It is mentioned that Carly also buys some cans of fruit drinks but their price is not mentioned in the problem. So, they are considered free (or included in the price of other items).\n5.  Subtract the total cost of the food from the $50 that Carly gave to find the change."

Without knowledge of the drink can price, it is impossible to accurately determine Carly's change. As a result, this problem is unsolvable with the given information. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: {None}"
