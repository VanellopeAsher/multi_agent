Robots: Given that there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots can be calculated as 2000 divided by 2.\n\n3. Footballs: Given that there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs can be calculated as 2000 multiplied by 2.\n\nThe total number of items Dominick saw can be calculated by adding the number of helmets, robots, and footballs.\n\nLet's translate these steps into calculations which Agent Code Executor will do."
