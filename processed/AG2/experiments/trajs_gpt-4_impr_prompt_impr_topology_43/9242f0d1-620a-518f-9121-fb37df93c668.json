  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

First, add up the costs for the computer (€1090), scanner (€157), CD burner (€74), and printer (€102). \n2. Once you have the total for these items, subtract the total from the amount gifted to her which is €1500.\nThe result will be the amount she has left for her new outfit."

Agent Code Executor has implemented the solution in the form of a Python script, while Agent Problem Solver provided a stepwise analysis.\n\nComparing the solutions provided by both agents, it's clear they aligned and incorporated the given values correctly from the problem without making any assumptions. The approach involves summing up the costs for the computer, scanner, CD burner, and printer, and subtracting the total cost from the gifted amount (€1500).\n\nThe output from executing Agent Code Executor's code is '77', hence, verifying that they both are correct.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 77. Elvira has €77 left to spend on her new outfit."
