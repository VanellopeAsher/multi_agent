      "content": "1. Let's begin by looking at the information we have. Peter has 70 dollars for a week and spends equal amounts from Sunday to Saturday. This means each day he spends $70/7 = $10.\n\n2. From Sunday through Wednesday, for four days, he bought wooden action figures which cost $5 each with his daily $10. This implies he bought 2 wooden action figures per day for these four days. Therefore, in total he bought 2 figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden figures.\n\n3. From Thursday to Saturday, for the remaining three days, he spent his daily $10 on plastic action figures which cost $2.5 each. Given each toy costs $2.5, he bought 4 plastic action figures per day with his daily 10 dollars. Therefore, in total he bought 4 figures/day * 3 days = 12 plastic figures.\n\n4. By the end of the week, the total number of action figures that Peter will have is the sum of the wooden and plastic figures: 8 wooden figures + 12 plastic figures = 20 figures in total. \n\nSo, Peter will have 20 action figures by the end of the week."

      "content": "To confirm the problem solver's explanation, let's solve the problem by writing Python code.\n\n- First, calculate the spending amount per day from the total amount and the number of days in a week.\n- Next, calculate the number of wooden action figures bought from Sunday through Wednesday. It will be the cost per day divided by the cost of a wooden action figure, multiplied by the number of these days.\n- After that, calculate the number of plastic action figures bought from Thursday to Saturday. It will be the cost per day divided by the cost of a plastic action figure, multiplied by the number of these days.\n- Finally, calculate the total number of action figures by summing up the number of wooden and plastic action figures.\n\nLet's execute the plan."
