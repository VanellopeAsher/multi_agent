So, the total cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.\n- A ballpen costs $0.50.\n- The cost of a pencil case is twice the cost of one notebook and two ballpens. We calculate the cost as follows:\n\n  - The cost of one notebook and two ballpens is $1.50 (notebook) + 2*$0.50 (ballpens) = $2.50.\n  - So, the cost of the pencil case is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.\n\nTherefore, the total cost that William paid is the cost of five notebooks + the cost of a ballpen + the cost of a pencil case. That's $7.50 + $0.50 + $5.00, which equals $13.00.\n\nThis should be in line with the solutions provided by the other agents. I am now open for any suggestions or discussions regarding my approach."
