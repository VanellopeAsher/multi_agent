Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

But we currently do not know how many points Joey scored in his turn (X). Until that information is provided, we cannot determine by how many points Joey is winning."
