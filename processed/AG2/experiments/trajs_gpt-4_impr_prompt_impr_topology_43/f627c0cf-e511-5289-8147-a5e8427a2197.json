You can calculate the initial weight as follows:\n\nGiven:\nFinal weight = 70 pounds\nUnwell = 5 months \nWeight loss per month = 10 pounds/month\n\nWe know that the weight Mark lost is equivalent to the weight loss per month (10 pounds/month) times the number of months he was unwell (5 months). So the total weight he lost was 10*5 = 50 pounds.\n\nHis initial weight would be his final weight plus the weight he lost. \n= 70 + 50\n= 120 pounds\n\nSo, Mark's initial weight was 120 pounds."

They have both correctly used the total weight loss during the period of illness to calculate Mark's initial weight. Therefore, I agree with their calculations and conclusions. \n\nMark's initial weight should be his final weight (70 pounds) plus the weight he lost during the period he was unwell, which is 10 pounds per month for 5 months. That is a total weight loss of 50 pounds. Adding the final weight to the total weight loss gives the initial weight as 120 pounds. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{120} pounds**"
