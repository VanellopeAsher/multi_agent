That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",

Add the extra cost for the porcelain crown which is $500.5.\n3. Subtract the amount he's already deposited ($600) from the total.\n4. Compute the number of hours he has to work by dividing the balance amount by his hourly wage ($15.3/hour).\n5. Round up the result to the nearest whole number, because he can't work a fraction of an hour.\n \nRemember, each step needs to be calculated separately for an accurate answer. Let's compute."

      "content": "After carefully reviewing the problem and the proposed solutions, I agree that both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor have calculated it correctly. The total cost for the dental work was accurately computed by considering the cost of two implants, and an additional crown. The pre-paid deposit was correctly subtracted from the total cost. The number of hours George needs to work was computed by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage, and the result was rounded up to the nearest hour since he cannot work fractions of an hour. Thus, the conclusion is George needs to work 255 hours to afford his dental work. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{255}**."
