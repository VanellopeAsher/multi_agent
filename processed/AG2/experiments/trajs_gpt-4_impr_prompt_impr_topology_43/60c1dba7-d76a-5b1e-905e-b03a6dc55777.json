With this information, we know that Becca + Smendrick + PJ = 447. \n\nThe problem also states that Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick, which can be written as Becca = 15 + Smendrick, and Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards that PJ has, which can be written as Smendrick = 4*PJ. \n\nWe can substitute these equations into the total equation to find each person's number of cards. Let's solve this equation step by step by using Python's sympy package. First, we solve the equation for P. Then, we substitute the value of P into Smendrick's equation to solve for S. Finally, we substitute the value of S into Becca's equation to find her number of cards. \n\nAfter calculating, we found that Becca has 207 cards. \n\nWe should verify this result to make sure it's correct. \n\nLet's substitute Becca, Smendrick, and PJ's values back into the total equation. If the total matches the given total of 447, then our answers are correct. \n\nIf Becca = 207, Smendrick = 192, PJ = 48, then substituting these values back into the total equation gives 447, which matches the given total, so our answers are correct. Becca has 207 cards. \n\nAfter comparison, I conclude that the answers provided by Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor are aligned and correct. Both solutions run the same step-by-step procedure to figure out the number of cards that Becca has.
