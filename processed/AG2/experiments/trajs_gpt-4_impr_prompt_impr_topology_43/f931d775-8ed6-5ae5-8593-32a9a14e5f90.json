  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

      "content": "Let's solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. The solo song is 54 lines and Sean has to memorize all of them.\n2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so that’s 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Sean has to memorize a third of these lines which is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.\n3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so that’s 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Sean has to memorize four-fifths of these lines which is 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.\n4. Finally, Sean has to memorize an additional 15 lines because one actor can't come.\n\nAdding these together, we will find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize.\n"
