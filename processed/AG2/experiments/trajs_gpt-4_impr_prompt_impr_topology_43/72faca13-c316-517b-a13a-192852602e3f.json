Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

The result from step 3 will be how much money she has left.\n\nNow let's turn these steps into equations:\n1. Total money = (num of quarters * value of a quarter) + (num of dimes * value of a dime) = (5 * 25 cents) + (2 * 10 cents).\n2. Money after buying pop = Total money - cost of pop = Result from step 1 - 55 cents.\n3. Money after buying candy bar = Money after buying pop - cost of candy bar = Result from step 2 - 45 cents.\n\nI'll let Agent_Code_Executor demonstrate with actual calculations."
