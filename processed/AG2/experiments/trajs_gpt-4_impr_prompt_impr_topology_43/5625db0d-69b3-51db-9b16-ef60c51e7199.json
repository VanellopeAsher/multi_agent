The next day, the price increased to $25 per fruit, but the store also offered a 15% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 15 apples.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow the steps below:\n\n1. For the first day:\n   - Calculate the total cost of the 15 apples, by multiplying 15 (the number of apples) by $15 (the cost of each apple).\n   - Subtract the $3 voucher from the total cost to find the final price Clara paid on the first day. \n  \n2. For the second day:\n   - Calculate the total cost of the 15 apples without any discount, by multiplying 15 (the number of apples) by $25 (the cost of each apple).\n   - Calculate the amount that was discounted, by multiplying the total cost by 15%.\n   - Subtract that amount from the total cost to find the final price Sheila paid on the second day.\n    \n3. Finally, subtract the final price on the first day from the final price on the second day to find the difference in prices. \n\nThings to note:\n- It might be important to note the usage of a discount and a voucher and how they affect the total cost differently.\n- It also assumes that the 15% discount is calculated after the initial price of each apple is multiplied by the quantity.\n- Clarifications on these assumptions might be needed to better understand the problem and to ensure a more accurate solution. \n\nIf the assumptions stand, we can proceed with the calculations."

The code appears to calculate the cost for each day accurately, accounting for discounts and vouchers, and then calculates the difference between the two days' costs. \n\nThe verifier agent has validated this solution. Additional input might be needed if there are different assumptions or conditions to the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, Sheila paid $205 more for the apples than Clara did, taking into account the different prices, the voucher, and the discount."
