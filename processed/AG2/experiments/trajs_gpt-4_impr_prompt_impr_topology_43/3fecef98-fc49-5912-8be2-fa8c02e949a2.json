      "content": "Here's how we can solve the problem:\n\n1. First, we calculate the dimensions of the comforter. The king-sized bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Hence, the comforter needs to be 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet long and 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet wide.\n\n2. We calculate the area of the comforter by multiplying its length by its width. The area is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.\n\n3. It's stated that Jim needs two pieces of this fabric for the comforter. Therefore, 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet of fabric is needed for the comforter.\n\n4. We then calculate the area of the duvet. It's 9 feet long and 11 feet wide. Hence, the area is 9 feet * 11 feet = 99 square feet.\n\n5. Finally, we add the area of the fabric required for the comforter and the duvet. So, Jim needs 160 square feet + 99 square feet = 259 square feet of fabric."
