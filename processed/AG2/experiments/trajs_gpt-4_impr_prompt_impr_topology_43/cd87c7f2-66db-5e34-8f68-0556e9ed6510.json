In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "1. First, find the total number of balloons they started with. The balloons are filled in packs, 100 balloons per pack. They filled up 10 packs of balloons. So, the total number of balloons they started with is 100 balloons per pack multiplied by 10 packs, which is 1000 balloons.\n\n2. Second, find out how many balloons were used by subtracting the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with. They ended the afternoon with 120 balloons left. So, subtract 120 from 1000.\n\n3. The result from step 2 is the number of balloons they threw. \n\nLet's write this solution mathematically:\n\nTotal Balloons = 100 (per pack) * 10 (packs) = 1000 Balloons\nBalloons thrown = Total Balloons - Balloons Left \n                            = 1000 - 120 \n                            = 880 Balloons thrown"
