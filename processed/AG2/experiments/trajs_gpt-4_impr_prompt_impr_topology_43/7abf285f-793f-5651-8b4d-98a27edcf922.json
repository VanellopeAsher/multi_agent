First, we need to calculate the total minimum payments for Jessica's debts which include student loans, credit card, and mortgage.  \n   The total minimum payment = Student Loan payment + Credit Card payment + Mortgage payment\n   The total minimum payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000\n   \n2. We know that Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts.  \n   So, total payment with 50% more = Total minimum payment + 50% of total minimum payment\n                      \n3. Note that the cost of Netflix has been offset by a coupon, so it doesn't impact the total cost.\n\n3. Finally, to get the total cost for the year, we multiply by 12. \n\nTotal cost for the year = Total payment per month * 12"

The total sum of these monthly payments is $1000. Jessica plans to pay 50% more than the minimal required payment, which amounts to the total of $1500/month. Over one year, given that every month she pays this sum, Jessica's total debt paid off amounts to $18000/year."
