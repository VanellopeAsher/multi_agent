According to the first information, Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran five times what Paisley ran, so we have the equation R=5*4=20 miles. Reggie ran 20 miles.\n\n3. According to the second piece of information, Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn, meaning L=R-3\n\n4. We know that R equals 20, so substitute that into the second equation to get L=20-3=17 miles\n\n5. So, Lynn ran 17 miles. \n\nThus, the distance Lynn ran is 17 miles. Let's get the answer checked by Agent Code Executor before we confirm that it's the final solution."
