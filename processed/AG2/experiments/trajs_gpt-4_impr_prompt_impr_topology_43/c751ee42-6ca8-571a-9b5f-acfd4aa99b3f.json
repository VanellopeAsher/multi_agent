Finally, we add the tax to the total cost of all items to find the total cost.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n1. The cost of food items is: milk (2 dollars) + eggs (3 dollars) + cookies (2 dollars) + water (1 dollar) = 8 dollars\n2. Non-food items are: light bulbs (3 dollars) + cups (3 dollars) + roach traps (4 dollars) = 10 dollars\n3. The total cost before tax is the cost of food items + non-food items = 8 dollars + 10 dollars = 18 dollars\n4. The tax for non-food items is: 10% of 10 dollars = 1 dollar\n5. The total cost after adding tax is: total cost before tax + tax = 18 dollars + 1 dollar = 19 dollars.\n\nSo, John paid 19 dollars for everything."
