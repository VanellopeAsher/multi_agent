Recall that the mean score is 70 and the total number of scores including the forgotten one is 9. So we multiply 70 by 9 to get the total sum of all scores including the forgotten one.\n3. Then subtract the total sum of the given scores from the total sum required to have a mean of 70. The resulting value gives us the forgotten score.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps."
