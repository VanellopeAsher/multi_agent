      "content": "Here's the step by step solution to this problem:\n\n1. Identify the time required for John to drink one bottle of water. In this case, it's mentioned that John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.\n\n2. Calculate how long it takes John to solve a normal sudoku. It's given that normal sudoku takes him 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, for a normal sudoku puzzle, he drinks 1 bottle of water.\n\n3. Calculate the time it takes for John to solve an extreme sudoku by multiplying the time it takes him to solve a normal sudoku by 3. It is stated that an extreme sudoku takes 3 times as long as a normal sudoku, so it would take him 3*30 = 90 minutes or 1.5 hours.\n\n4. Lastly, calculate how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku. Since he drinks a bottle every half hour, and it takes 1.5 hours for him to solve an extreme puzzle, he drinks 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 bottles of water during this time.\n\nSo in total, John drinks 4 bottles of water (1 for the normal sudoku and 3 for the extreme sudoku)."
