      "content": "Sure! Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The flat fee for the first venue is $2000, and each person adds a $50 cost for food.\n2. Thus, the total cost for the first venue is $2000 + $50 * num_guests. \n3. The second venue charges $250 per person with food included.\n4. Therefore, its total cost is $250 * num_guests.\n5. To find the number of guests (num_guests) that would make the two venues cost the same, we can set the two costs as equal to each other:\n\n     (2000 + 50 * num_guests) = (250 * num_guests)  \n\nBy subtracting 50 * num_guests from both sides and solving the resulting equation, we will get the number of guests (num_guests) which will make the total cost of the two venues equal."
