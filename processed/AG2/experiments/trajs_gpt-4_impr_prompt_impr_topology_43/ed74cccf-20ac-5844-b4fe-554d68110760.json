In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Twice the number of students playing tennis are playing volleyball; this means 6 * 2 = 12 students are playing volleyball.\n3. We are given that some boys and 22 girls are playing soccer; however, we do not know the exact total figure of students playing soccer.\n\nTherefore, without the total number of students playing soccer, it isn't possible to determine the total number of students overall. \n\nWe can only know that at least 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 22 (girls in soccer) = 40 students are there. However, this doesn't account for the boys playing soccer. Therefore, the accurate total number of students cannot be specifically determined without the information on the number of boys playing soccer."

The Python code correctly calculates the minimum number of students by adding up the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and the number of girls playing soccer. Likewise, the Problem Solver manually calculates the minimum number of students using the same values. Hence, they both are correct in stating that the total number of students cannot be explicitly determined without the number of boys playing soccer.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: None"
