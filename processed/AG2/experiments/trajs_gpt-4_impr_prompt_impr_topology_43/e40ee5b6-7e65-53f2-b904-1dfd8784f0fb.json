In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Sure, I can provide a step-by-step breakdown to solve this problem:\n\nStep 1:  According to the problem, the price of a one-gallon jar is $5.\n          \nStep 2:  It is also mentioned that a one-gallon jar is priced $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since the price of a one-gallon jar is $5, it means the half-gallon jar price is $5 - $2 = $3. \n\nStep 3:  To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent on purchasing the jars, you need to calculate the total cost for the one gallon jars, and the total cost for the half gallon jars, then sum these together.\n\nStep 4: Cecelia purchased 10 one-gallon jars and each jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost for the one-gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50.\n\nStep 5: She also purchased 16 jars of half a gallon, each costing $3, Therefore, the cost for the half gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.\n\nStep 6: Add together the cost for the one-gallon jars and the half-gallon jars: $50 + $48 = $98. \n\nTherefore, Cecelia spent a total of $98."

Considering the above explanation by Agent_Problem_Solver, I would code the problem in the following way:\n\nFirst, I will define the prices of the jars. Then, I will calculate the total cost for the jars Cecelia purchased. Finally, I will print the calculated cost.\n\n```python\n# Price of the one gallon jar\nprice_one_gallon = 5  \n\n# Price of the half gallon jar\nprice_half_gallon = price_one_gallon - 2\n\n# Number of one gallon jars bought\nnum_one_gallon = 10\n\n# Number of half gallon jars bought\nnum_half_gallon = 16\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = (num_one_gallon * price_one_gallon) + (num_half_gallon * price_half_gallon)\nprint(total_cost)\n```\nLet's execute this code block. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

The step-by-step procedure and the code both follow the logic of calculating the total cost of each type of jar and summing them up. The total sum spent on 10 one-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, according to both agents, is $98. Since both answers are consistent and logically backed up, I consent with this solution.\n\nHence, the final solution is **SOLUTION_FOUND** $\\boxed{98}$."
