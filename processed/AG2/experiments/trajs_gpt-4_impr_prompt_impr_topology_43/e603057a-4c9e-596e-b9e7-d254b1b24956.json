      "content": "-I will start solving this problem by setting up two algebraic equations from the information given in the problem.\n\n-Assume that Seth's current age is 'x' and Brooke's current age is 'y'. Given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write the first equation as:\n\n  Equation 1: x = 2y\n\n-The problem also mentions that in three years, the sum of their ages will be 36. So, we can write the second equation as:\n\n  Equation 2: (x + 3) + (y + 3) = 36\n\n-(You add 3 years to both their ages because in three years, Seth will be x + 3 years old, and Brooke will be y + 3 years old.)\n\n-After setting up these two equations, we can solve for 'x' and 'y'. We can simplify Equation 2 and get:\n\n  x + y = 30 \n\n-Next, we substitute Equation 1 (x = 2y) into Equation 2 (x + y = 30), yielding:\n\n  3y = 30. \n\n-So, the solution for 'y' (Brooke's age) is:\n\n  y = 30/3 = 10.\n\n-Finally, we substitute 'y' back into Equation 1 (x = 2y) to find 'x' (Seth's age):\n\n  x = 2 * 10\n\n  x = 20. \n\n-So, Seth is 20 years old. \n\n-Now we discuss this solution with other agents to know their views."

      "content": "The solution provided by Agent_Problem_Solver looks correct to me. I am going to solve this problem using Python and the sympy package to confirm the ages of Seth and Brooke. \n\nLet's define two variables:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n```\n- Set up equation 1: \"Seth is twice as old as Brooke\", which can be written as x = 2y:\n\n```python\neq1 = Eq(x, 2*y)\n```\n\n- Set up equation 2: the sum of their ages in 3 years will be 36. Thus, (Seth's age + 3) + (Brooke's age + 3) = 36, which simplifies to x + y = 30:\n\n```python\neq2 = Eq(x + y, 30)\n```\n\n- Solve these equations for x and y using the sympy's solve function:\n\n```python\nsolution = solve((eq1,eq2), (x, y))\n```\n\n- The solve function will return a dictionary containing the solutions. Extract and print Seth's age:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Seth's age is {solution[x]}\")\n```\n\nNow, I am going to implement the above Python code.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

This solution does not seem to involve any assumptions and is based on the information provided in the problem statement. \n\n2. Agent Code Executor wrote Python code using the sympy package to solve the same equations.
