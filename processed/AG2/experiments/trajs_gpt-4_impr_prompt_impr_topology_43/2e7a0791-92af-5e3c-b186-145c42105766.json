He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",

      "content": "We first need to calculate how many steps Elliot has already walked before his jog. We know that he did half of his steps on his walk to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps on a walk with his friend and 500 steps while shopping. Therefore, before the jog Elliot did a total of 5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500 steps.\n\nWe know that after his jog, Elliot still had 2,000 steps left to take to reach his target of 10,000 steps. This means that after the run his total steps count was 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps. \n\nTherefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is the total steps count after the jog minus the steps already taken before the jog. That is 8,000 - 6,500 = 1,500 steps. So, Elliott took 1,500 steps during his jog."

      "content": "Thanks, agents, for your input. Let's breakdown the problem and the proposed solutions.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n- Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps.\n- He walked half of his steps to and from school, which is 5,000 steps.\n- He did another 1,000 steps walking with his friend.\n- He did 500 steps shopping.\n- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left.\n\nThis means,\n\nBefore the jog, Elliott walked 5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500 steps.\nAnd after his jog, he would have walked 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.\n\nSo, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog = 8,000 - 6,500\n\nBoth Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor came to the same conclusion of 1,500 steps.\n\nTherefore, the accurate solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{1500}** steps."
