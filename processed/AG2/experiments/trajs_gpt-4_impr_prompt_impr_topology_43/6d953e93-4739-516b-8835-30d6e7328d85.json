For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of car tires the mechanic repaired on Friday. \n\nLet's denote the number of car tires repaired on Friday with the letter C. \n\nWe know that on Thursday the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. So, the mechanic earned 6*60 dollars for truck tires and 4*40 dollars for car tires on Thursday, totaling to 6*60 + 4*40 dollars.\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic only repaired car tires, and he earned 40*C dollars, where C is the number of car tires repaired that day.\n\nGiven that the mechanic earns 40 dollars more on Thursday than on Friday, we can set up the following equation: \n\n    6*60 + 4*40 = 40*C + 40 \n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of C, which is the number of car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday."
