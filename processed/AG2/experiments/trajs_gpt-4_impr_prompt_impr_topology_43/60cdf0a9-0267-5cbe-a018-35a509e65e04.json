Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she sold all her muffin crayons and made $36, how much each muffin crayon sells for?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many muffin crayons Kate was able to make. This is found by multiplying the number of boxes she got with the amount of crayons in a box and then dividing the result by the number of crayons used to make a muffin crayon. After that, we can calculate the price of a muffin crayon by dividing the total amount Kate made by selling all the muffin crayons by the number of crayons she made.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of crayon pieces: 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box\n2. Calculate the total number of muffin crayons: total crayon pieces / 8 pieces per muffin crayan\n3. Calculate the price per muffin crayon: $36 / total muffin crayons"
