She made 20 cards herself, and her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards. Assume each box contains the same number of cards.\n2. After that, we subtract the number of cards Erica gave to her classmates and family. From the problem, we know that she gave out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family.\n3. Finally, we add the number of cards Erica received from family and friends, which is stated as 17.\n\nNote: Since the problem does not specify how many cards are in each box that her dad brought, it would be good to have that information to solve the problem accurately."

She passed out a total of 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family members. So to find out how many cards Erica is left with, we need to add up the total number of cards she started with, subtract the number of cards she gave away, and add the number of Valentine's cards she received from family and friends.\n\nHowever, the problem statement doesn't specify the number of cards in each box Erica received from her dad.

We however have a gap as we don't know how many cards were in the boxes her dad gave her. If we were to assume that each box had say 10 cards (a typical number of cards in a Valentine's box), she would have started with 40 cards (20 she made and 20 from dad). After giving out 29, she would be left with 11. Adding the 17 she got, she would have 28 cards. The answer therefore, under that assumption, is 28 cards. But we need to know the number of cards in the boxes her dad gave her to know for sure."
