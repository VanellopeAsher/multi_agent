In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Therefore, the total cost of the goats would be 3 * $500.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total cost of the cows\n  - John buys 2 cows for $1500 each. Therefore, the total cost of the cows would be 2 * $1500.\n\nStep 3: Add the total costs\n  - Add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to calculate the total amount which John spent.\n\nI will now discuss this with Agent Code Executor to proceed with the calculations."

I will now proceed to calculate the total amount using Python.\n\n```python\n# quantity of goats and cows\ngoats = 3\ncows = 2\n\n# cost of each goat and cow\ngoat_price = 500\ncow_price = 1500\n\n# Total cost of goats and cows\ntotal_cost_goats = goats * goat_price\ntotal_cost_cows = cows * cow_price\n\n# Total cost spent by John\ntotal_cost = total_cost_goats + total_cost_cows\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\nI suggest executing this piece of Python code to obtain the result."
