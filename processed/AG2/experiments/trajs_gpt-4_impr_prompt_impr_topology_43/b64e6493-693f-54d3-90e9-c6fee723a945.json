      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the value of each type of coin in pennies. A quarter is worth 25 pennies, a dime is worth 10 pennies, a nickel is worth 5 pennies, and of course, a penny is worth 1 penny. \n\nGiven that, we can calculate the total amount of money Colby has in pennies:\n\n1. Multiply the number of quarters (80) with the value of a quarter in pennies (25) to get the value of all quarters in pennies.\n2. Multiply the number of dimes (60) with the value of a dime in pennies (10) to get the value of all dimes in pennies.\n3. Multiply the number of nickels (140) with the value of a nickel in pennies (5) to get the value of all nickels in pennies.\n4. Leave the value of all pennies (150) as is.\n5. Add up all the values calculated in steps 1 to 4 to get the total amount of money in pennies.\n\nThen, given that a gumball costs a nickel, which is equivalent to 5 pennies, we can calculate the number of gumballs Colby can buy as follows:\n\n1. Divide the total amount of money (in pennies) by the cost of a gumball (in pennies), which is 5, to get the number of gumballs he can buy.\n\nThe result is the quantity of gumballs Colby can buy. It's essential to clarify that the solution assumes that he wants to spend all his money on gumballs."
