The total duration will be the distance (70% of 30 miles, or 21 miles) divided by his speed (3 miles per hour).\n\nStep 2: James then rests for half the time it took him to swim 70% of the distance.\n\nStep 3: We next calculate the time James takes to swim the remaining distance which is 30% of the total distance at half speed. This is 30% of 30 miles (or 9 miles) divided by half his speed (1.5 miles per hour).\n\nStep 4: Finally, we add the swimming time (70% of the distance), the resting time, and the remaining swimming time (30% of the distance at half speed).\n\nWith these steps in mind, let's calculate the total time James needs to get across the lake."
