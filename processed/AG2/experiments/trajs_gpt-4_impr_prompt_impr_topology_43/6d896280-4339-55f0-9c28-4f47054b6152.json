They made the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that amount on Friday. They represented these constraints as equations, combined them, and solved for the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday. Both agents obtained the same result by different methods: dividing the total number of chimichangas, 500, by 4.\n\nAgent Code Executor wrote and executed Python code to calculate the result, while Agent Problem Solver detailed a step-by-step solution. The final, agreed-upon solution is that Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{125}"
