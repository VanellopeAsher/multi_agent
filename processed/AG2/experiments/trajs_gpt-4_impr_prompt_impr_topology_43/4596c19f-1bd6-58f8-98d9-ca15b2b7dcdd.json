This is found by multiplying the amount of each ingredient needed by its respective price, and summing these values. \n\nNext, we find the total cost of producing 10 jars by multiplying the cost of one jar by 10.\n\nThen, we calculate the total revenue which is the selling price of one jar ($50) multiplied by the number of jars sold (10).\n\nFinally, the profit is found by subtracting total costs from total revenue.\n\nLet's follow these steps to calculate the profit that Tim earns from selling 10 jars of this blend."

These costs were then added together to find the total cost of making one jar of the blend. To find the total cost for 10 jars, the agent rightfully multiplied the cost per jar by 10.\n\nThe revenue made from selling 10 jars was calculated by multiplying the selling price, $50, by the number of jars sold, 10. \n\nThe profit was then calculated by subtracting the total cost of production from total revenue, providing the overall net gain.\n\nLet's execute the code provided by Agent_Code_Executor to get the numerical solution."
