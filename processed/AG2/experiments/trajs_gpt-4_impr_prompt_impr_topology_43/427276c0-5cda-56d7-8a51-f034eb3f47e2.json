      "content": "The way to solve this problem is by using the formula for the average (mean) of a set of numbers, which is the sum of all the items divided by the count of items. \n\nHere's how we can solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify and list down all the heights of the heels.\n2. Add all the heights together to get the total sum.\n3. Divide the total sum by the total number of heels to find the average height.\n\nGiven that there are three women with 4.5-inch heels and three with 2.5-inch heels, we can apply the three steps as follows:\n\n1. The list of all the heights is: [4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]\n2. The total sum is: (4.5 * 3) + (2.5 * 3)\n3. The average height is: total sum / 6 (since there are six women) \n\nLet's calculate the total sum and the average heel height."

Each correctly stated that there are six women with two different heel heights (three in 4.5 inches and three in 2.5 inches). \n\nUsing the mean calculation (sum/number of instances), they computed the average heel height. The Python code execution returned the average heel height as 3.5, which matches the manual computation proposed by the Agent Problem Solver.\n\nTherefore, the final average heel height at this party is 3.5 inches.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3.5}"
