In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop - 8. Resulting in 48 - 8 = 40.\n3. Add the number of people who got on at the first stop, which is 5 times the number who got off, or 5 * 8 = 40. Add this to the result of step 2, resulting in 40 + 40 = 80.\n4. Subtract the 2 people who decide to get off before the bus departs. We now have 80 - 2 = 78.\n5. At the second stop, subtract the 21 passengers who get off. We now have 78 - 21 = 57.\n6. Finally, add the number of people who got on at the second stop, which is a third of the number who got off, or 21 / 3 = 7. Add this to the result of step 5, we now have 57 + 7 = 64. Therefore, there are 64 passengers riding the bus after the second stop."

Let's write the Python code that follows the steps of Agent Problem Solver.\n\nStep 1 and 2: Subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop from the initial passengers.\n```python\npassengers = 48\npassengers -= 8\n```\nResulting passengers = 40.\n\nStep 3: Add the people who got in at the first station which is 5 times the number of those who got off.\n```python\npassengers += 5*8\n```\nResulting passengers = 80.\n\nStep 4: Subtract the 2 people who got off before the departure.\n```python\npassengers -= 2\n```\nResulting passengers = 78.\n\nStep 5: Subtract the 21 passengers who got off at the second stop.\n```python\npassengers -= 21\n```\nResulting passengers = 57.\n\nStep 6: Add the number of people who got on at the second stop. It's a third of the number of people who got off.\n```python\npassengers += 21//3\n```\nResulting passengers = 64. \n\nThe final Python code will be this:\n```python\n# Starting with the initial number of passengers\npassengers = 48\n# First stop\npassengers -= 8  # Number of passengers after 8 got off \npassengers += 5*8  # Number of passengers after 5 times the ones who got off got in \npassengers -= 2  # Number of passengers after 2 decided to get off\n# Second stop\npassengers -= 21  # Number of passengers after 21 got off\npassengers += 21//3  # Number of passengers after a third of the ones got off got in\nprint(passengers)\n```\nLet's run this code now.\n"
