Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

Calculate the cost of a single pack of chicken by multiplying the cost of a pack of bacon by 2, since it is mentioned that each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\n3. Find the total cost of the chicken by multiplying the cost per pack of chicken by the number of chicken packs: 6 * cost per packet of chicken.\n4. Calculate the total cost of strawberries by multiplying the cost per pack by the number of packs: 3 packs * $4.5 .\n5. Find the cost of a single pack of apples by dividing the cost of a pack of strawberries by 2, since each pack of apples costs half as much as a pack of strawberries.\n6. Find the total cost of apples by multiplying the cost per packet of apples by the number of apple packs: 7 * cost per packet of apples\n7. Finally, subtract the total cost of bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples from her budget of $65 to find out how much money Kelly has left."
