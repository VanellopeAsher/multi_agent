Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Since it's mentioned that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of miles Paisley ran by 5.\n\nOnce we have determined the number of miles run by Reggie, we will subtract the sum of the miles run by Reggie and Paisley from the total distance, to calculate Lynn's run miles.\n\nHowever, there is no total distance provided in the problem statement to perform the required calculations required to find Lynn's run miles. Please provide that for further assistance."
