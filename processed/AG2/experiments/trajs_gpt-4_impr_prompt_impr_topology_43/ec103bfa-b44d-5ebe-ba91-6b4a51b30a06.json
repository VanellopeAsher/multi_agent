In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Subtract the total from the total amount Marie paid.\n3. Divide the resulting amount by the cost of each pizza box to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie bought.\n\nCalculations:\n1. Total cost of chicken meal, 5 packs of milk, and 40 apples: $120 + 5*$30 + 40*$1.50\n2. Difference between what Marie paid and the cost of chicken meal, packs of milk, and apples: $900 - total cost of previous items\n3. Number of pizza boxes: difference/cost of each pizza box. \n\nThe result should be rounded down as Marie cannot buy a fractional pizza box."

The cost of all other items Marie ordered (chicken meal, milk, and apples) was subtracted from the total amount she paid, and then the remaining amount was divided by the price of a pizza box to find the amount of pizza boxes. The final result is integer since partial pizza boxes aren't possible to purchase. \n\nTherefore, Marie ordered 10 boxes of pizza.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{10}."
