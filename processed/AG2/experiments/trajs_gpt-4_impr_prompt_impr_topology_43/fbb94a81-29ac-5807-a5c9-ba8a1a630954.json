      "content": "Here's my approach to solving this problem:\n\nLet's suppose:\n- Peter's age is P,\n- Paul's age is A,\n- and John's age is J.\n\nAccording to the problem, we have three equations:\n\n1. P + A + J = 100  \n   (The combined age of Peter, Paul and John is 100 years old)\n\n2. A = J + 18  \n   (Paul is 18 years older than John)\n\n3. P = A + J  \n   (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)\n\nWe can solve these equations step by step to find the age of each individual.\n\nUsing Equation 2 (A = J + 18), we can substitute A in Equation 1:\n\n  P + J + 18 + J = 100\n  \nThis simplifies to:\n\n  P = 100 - 2J - 18\n\nSince it's given that P equals the sum of A and J (equation 3), we can substitute A and J in place of P\n\n  (J + 18) + J = 100 - 2J - 18\n  \nResolving this gives us the ages of Paul, Peter, and John. You can continue solving these equations to find each person’s age. \n\nFinally, insert each person’s age back into the original equations to verify our solutions are correct."

Create symbols for the three variables - P, A, J (Peter's, Paul's, and John's ages).\n\n2. Implement the three equations given in the problem using these symbols.\n\n3.
