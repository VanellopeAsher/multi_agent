In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

After we get this number, we can multiply it by 30 (since each pack contains 30 balloons) to find out the total number of balloons they had at the beginning.\n\nFrom that total, we subtract the 12 balloons that were left to find out how many balloons were thrown.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Identify the number of packs of balloons they used.\n2. Multiply that number by 30 to get the total number of balloons.\n3. Subtract 12 (the number of balloons left) from the total number of balloons to find out how many balloons were thrown.\n\nWithout the information about the number of packs used, it's impossible to solve this problem. Could you provide the missing information?"
