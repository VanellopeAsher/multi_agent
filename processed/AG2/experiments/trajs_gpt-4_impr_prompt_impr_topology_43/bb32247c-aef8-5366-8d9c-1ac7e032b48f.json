Now we can start solving the problem:\n\nAccording to the problem, we have three weeks of growth to account for:\n\n1. Week 1: The beanstalk grew to 2 inches tall.\n2. Week 2: The height of the beanstalk doubled. \n3. Week 3: The beanstalk grew an additional 4 inches.\n\nSo, we simply need to follow these steps to find the height of the beanstalk after three weeks. Here's how we can do it in Python code:\n\n```python\n# Original height of the beanstalk after first week\ninitial_height = 2\n\n# After second week, the height doubles\nsecond_week_height = initial_height * 2\n\n# After third week, the height increases by an additional 4 inches\nfinal_height = second_week_height + 4\n\nprint(final_height)           # Print the final height of the beanstalk\n```\nThe above code will give us the final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks. Let's execute it and see the result."

When the original height of the beanstalk was provided as 2 inches, Agent Code Executor correctly calculated the height after each subsequent week. The height doubled in the second week, resulting in a height of 4 inches, and the beanstalk grew another 4 inches in the third week, resulting in a final height of 8 inches. The Python code is correctly executed and well-formatted, with variables clearly defined and calculations appropriately performed, leading to the final solution of 8 inches.\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{8}"
