      "content": "Here's how we can approach and solve this problem.\n\n1. On Monday the depth of the water is 17 feet, as given in the problem.\n2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than it had on Monday. Since the depth on Monday was 17 feet, on Tuesday it is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.\n3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, on Wednesday, the depth is (2/3)*24 = 16 feet.\n4. On Thursday, the water depth in the tank increases by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday. The difference between Tuesday and Wednesday is 24 - 16 = 8 feet. So, the increase on Thursday is (1/2)*8 = 4 feet.\n5. Therefore, on Thursday, the water depth in the tank is the depth on Wednesday plus the increase on Thursday, which is 16 + 4 = 20 feet. \n\nSo, the water depth on Thursday is 20 feet."
