      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Find out how many bucks are there. Since 30 percent of the deer are bucks, we multiply the total number of deer (80) by 30 percent (0.30).\nStep 2: Calculate the number of 6 point bucks. 50 percent of the bucks are 6 points, so we multiply the total number of bucks by 50 percent (0.50).\nStep 3: Round the result to the nearest integer if it is not an integer already. This is because the number of deer cannot be a fraction. \n\nBy these steps, we can find how many 6 point bucks are there. I will now discuss this with Agent Code Executor to proceed with the numerical calculations."

The number of 6 point bucks is calculated by first finding the total bucks (30% of 80) and then finding 50% of these bucks. The resultant value should be rounded to the nearest whole number as we can't have a fraction of a deer. \n\nThe executed code also adheres to the solution steps, and it gives an output of '12'. Therefore, there are 12 6-point bucks in the field.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}."
