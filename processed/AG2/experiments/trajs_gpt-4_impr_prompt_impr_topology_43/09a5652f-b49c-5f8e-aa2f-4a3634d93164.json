The second and third days, John runs for half the time he ran on the first day, so he runs 1.5 hours each of these two days.\n4.  So, over the entire week, John runs for 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.\n\nJohn covers a total distance of 60 miles in these 6 hours of running.\n\nSpeed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. Therefore, to find John's running speed, we divide 60 miles by 6 hours. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculation."
