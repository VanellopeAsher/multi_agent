      "content": "Solution:\n\n1. Since all sisters are 16 years old and there are 10 of them, the total age of the sisters is 10 * 16 = 160.\n2. The younger brother is 12 years old. It's given that he is half the age of the older brother, so the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n3. To find the total age of the siblings, we add together the ages of the sisters and the brothers. This equals 160 (for the sisters) + 12 (for the younger brother) + 24 (for the older brother) = 196.\n\nSo, the total age of all these siblings is 196 years."

      "content": "Alright, let's verify this solution using Python code. \n\nThe first step is to calculate the total age of the sisters, which we can achieve by multiplying the number of sisters by their age. Next, we find the age of the older brother by doubling the age of the younger brother. Finally, we add together the ages of the sisters, the younger brother, and the older brother to get the total. Let's execute this:\n\n```python\n# Number of sisters\nnum_sisters = 10\n# Age of sisters\nage_sisters = 16\n\n# Age of younger brother\nage_younger_brother = 12\n\n# Calculate total age of sisters\ntotal_age_sisters = num_sisters * age_sisters\n\n# Calculate age of older brother (which is twice the age of younger brother)\nage_older_brother = age_younger_brother * 2\n\n# Calculate total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_age_sisters + age_younger_brother + age_older_brother\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
