Given that he worked double the hours of Tuesday, you will multiply the Tuesday's hours (5 hours) by 2. \n\nStep 3: Determine Bruce's working hours on Thursday. It's mentioned that he worked 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday. Thus, subtract 2 hours from the hours Bruce worked on Wednesday. \n\nStep 4: Add up the total hours Bruce worked from Tuesday to Thursday. Sum up the hours worked on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to get the total hours."

Bruce has worked a total of 23 hours from Tuesday to Thursday. This is calculated as follows:\n\n- Tuesday: 5 hours\n- Wednesday: twice the hours of Tuesday, 5*2 = 10 hours\n- Thursday: 2 hours less than Wednesday, 10-2 = 8 hours\n\nAdding up these amounts gives the total work hours for the three days as 23 hours.\n\nThus, the solution has been correctly calculated and implemented."
