      "content": "Here's how I would solve the problem:\n\n1. First, we're told that 20 students do not have desktop computers.  According to the problem, this represents three-fourths of the students in the grade level.\n\n2. So to find out how many students are in this grade level, we would divide the number of students without desktop computers by the fraction representing students with desktop computers. If 20 students represent one-fourth (the complement of three-fourths) of the students, then the total number of students equals 20 divided by 1/4, or 20 multiplied by 4/1, which equals 80.\n\n3. The problem then gives us additional information: the 20 students without desktop computers represent one-third of the students who do not have either a desktop or laptop computer. We can equate this to 1/3 multiplied by the total number of students without a computer (desktop or laptop), which we'll represent as X.\n\n4. We set up the equation: \n    20 = 1/3 * X \n\n5. To solve for X, multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n    60 = X \n\n6. X represents the number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop computer, which is 60. Adding this to the number we found earlier (those with desktop computers), we get:\n    80 students with desktop computers + 60 students without either computer = 140 students \n\n7. Thus according to the information given, there are 140 students at that grade level."
