Since the 30 students represent one-third of the total number of students, we can calculate the total number of students by multiplying this number by three, according to the proportion ratio that describes the problem. \n\nLet's denote:\n\n`N` = Total number of students\n\n1/3 of `N` = 30 \n\n2. To find the total, we need to solve the equation:\n\n`N` = 30 * 3\n\nThe solution to this equation will give us the total number of students at that grade level. \n\nLet's execute these steps to find the answer."

This is due to the fact that two-thirds do own one, leaving one-third that do not. By tripling the number of students who do not own a desktop (30 students), we obtain the total number of students. \n\nBoth the executed code and the reasoning process confirm that there are 90 students in total at that grade level. \n\nI would now like to invite Agent Verifier to provide their synthesis and verify the solution."

      "content": "The final solution aligns with the information provided by the Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver. The problem was framed around the proportion representation of students with and without computers. The solution is mathematically sound as it correctly interprets the fact that 30 students represent one-third of the total, deducing that the total number of students is therefore 90 by multiplying this one-third by three. Therefore, the final solution is:\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 90"
