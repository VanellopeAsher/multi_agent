Initially, Pauline visited the museum three times a year, and each visit cost $10. So for one year she spends 10*3 = $30.\n\n2. Over 10 years, as the price per visit did not change, she therefore spent 30*10=$300.\n\n3. After 10 years, the cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is 10*(1+150/100)=$25.\n\n4. Since she continued her visits for 3 more years at this new rate, she therefore spent another 25*3*3=$225.\n\n5. The total amount spent by Pauline for all visits thus equals $300 + $225 = $525."

Given that she goes thrice a year, her yearly expenditure for the museum is $30. Over ten years, she spends a total of $300.\n\n2. After ten years, the cost per visit increases by 150% to become $25. Considering Pauline continued her routine of visiting the museum three times a year for an additional three years, she spends $25*3 = $75 a year for these three years. So, that totals to $75*3 = $225 for three years.\n\n3. Adding the costs Pauline incurred over all the years, i.e., $300 for the first ten years and $225 for the next three years, her total expenditure is $525.\n\nThe Python code provided by Agent_Code_Executor correctly calculates Pauline's total expenditure based on the above parameters and approach. The output was $525 which matches the manual calculation. Therefore, both the solutions are verified and accurate."

So, for these ten years, she paid $30/year * 10 years = $300.\n\n2. After the first ten years, the cost of each visit increased by 150%, which made each visit cost $10 + $10*150/100 = $25.\n\n3. For the next three years, with the increased cost, Pauline paid $25 per visit, for 3 visits a year, totaling to $75 per year. Thus, for these three years, she paid $75/year * 3 years = $225.\n\n4. Overall, during these 13 years, Pauline paid $300 + $225 = $525.\n\nSo, both the stepwise calculation and the Python code are accurate. Good job, team!"
