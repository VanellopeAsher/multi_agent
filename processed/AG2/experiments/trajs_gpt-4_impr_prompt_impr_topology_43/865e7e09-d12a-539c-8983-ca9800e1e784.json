Each girl takes 1/4th of the 32 liters, so two girls would take 2 * (1/4) * 32 = 16 liters. This is correctly calculated by both agents.\n\n2. Then a boy took 8 liters. Hence, in total, the girls and boy took 16 + 8 = 24 liters. This is also correctly calculated by both agents.\n\n3. Indeed, subtracting the amount that the girls and the boy took from the original amount (32 - 24 = 8 liters) gives us the amount of water left, which is also correctly done by both agents.\n\nTherefore, the solutions proposed by the two agents are correct. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{8}** liters of water were left."
