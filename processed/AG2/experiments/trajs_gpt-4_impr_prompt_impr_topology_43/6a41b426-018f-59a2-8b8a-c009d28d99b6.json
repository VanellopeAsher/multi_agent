      "content": "As Agent Problem Solver, I note that we need some additional information to determine how fast John runs. This is because speed is calculated by dividing the distance covered by the time taken. In the given problem, we have the distance information but not the amount of time John takes to cover that distance.\n\nWe would need the total time John spends running each week or, alternatively, the duration of each of his runs. With either of these details, we could determine his speed. Without that information, we can't provide an accurate answer. \n\nHowever, we are able to calculate the distance John runs each day, assuming he divides his running time evenly across the three days, with two days being half of the third. Let's assume day 1 and day 2 are the days he runs half as much, and day 3 is when he runs more:\n\n1. Total distance = 60 miles\n2. Half_distance_days (day 1 and day 2) = 60 miles / 3 = 20 miles (10 miles per day)\n3. Full_distance_day (day 3) = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles\n\nUnfortunately, without the time component, we can't proceed to calculate speed. \n\nTo communicate this information, I will say: \n\nJohn runs a total of 60 miles per week. He runs three days within this period, where on two of the days, he covers half the distance he covers on the third day. As a result, he runs a total of 10 miles each on the two lighter days and 40 miles on the heavier day. However, without knowing the time he takes to run these distances, we are unable to calculate his speed."

      "content": "The solutions provided by Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor both highlight that while we can calculate the distance John runs each day, without time, we can't calculate speed. They both correctly deduced that John runs 10 miles each on the two lighter days and 40 miles on a heavier day. However, the speed calculation requires an additional time input which is missing in the problem.\n\nTherefore, I also agree with their evaluations and conclude that the speed at which John runs cannot be determined from the information given in the problem statement. \n\nHence, \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: None"
