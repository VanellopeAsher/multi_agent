      "content": "Alright, with the shark's length provided, the solution for the problem would be as:\n\n1. First, convert the length of the shark from feet to inches, because the length of the remoras is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so a 10-foot shark is 120 inches long. \n\n2. Next, find the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches, so two would have a combined length of 12 inches. \n\n3. Then find the ratio of the remoras' length to the shark's length by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark. This would be 12 / 120 = 0.1.\n\n4. Finally, convert the ratio to a percentage by multiplying by 100, 0.1 * 100 = 10%. So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. This is the solution assuming the given shark's length is 10 feet."

Therefore, I propose the following Python code to calculate the percentage:\n\n```python\n# Define the lengths:\nshark_length_ft = 10   # shark length in feet\nremora_length_in = 6   # remora length in inches\n\n# Convert shark length to inches\nshark_length_in = shark_length_ft * 12\n\n# Calculate total length of the remoras\ntotal_remoras_length = 2 * remora_length_in\n\n# Calculate the percentage\npercentage = (total_remoras_length / shark_length_in) * 100\n\n# Print the result\nprint(percentage)\n```\n\nThis should give us the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
