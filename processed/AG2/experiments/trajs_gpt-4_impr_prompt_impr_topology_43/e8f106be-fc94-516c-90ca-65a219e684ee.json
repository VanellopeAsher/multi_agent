His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

But we must remember that James doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. So we don't need to subtract anything from the total length of crepe paper needed because the tree doesn't affect the fence perimeter.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Calculate the total length which is 2*(20 ft + 15 ft)\n2. The amount of crepe paper James needs is the same as the total length calculated in step 1."
