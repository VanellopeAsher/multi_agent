      "content": "Elise wrote the alphabet three times in full, half of it once, and then re-wrote everything she already wrote. To figure out the total number of letters she wrote, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of letters when Elise writes the alphabet in full. The English alphabet consists of 26 letters. So, for three full writings, it will be 26 * 3 = 78 letters.\n2. Calculate the number of letters in half of the alphabet. Half of 26 letters is 13.\n3. Add up these totals to get the total number of letters Elise wrote before she started re-writing. So, we have 78 + 13 = 91 letters.\n4. Elise re-writes everything she has already written, which means she writes another 91 letters.\n5. Finally, we add the original total and the number of letters Elise wrote in her re-writing stage to get the final total: 91 + 91 = 182 letters. \n\nSo, Elise has written a total of 182 letters."
