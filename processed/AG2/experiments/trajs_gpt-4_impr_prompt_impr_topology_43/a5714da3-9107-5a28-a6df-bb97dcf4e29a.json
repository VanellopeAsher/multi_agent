Calculate the cost of the rocks which is 2 bags for $2.50 each. This would be 2 x $2.50 = $5.00\n  3. Calculate the cost of the corals. She bought 3 corals at $2.00 each. This would be 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.\n  4. Take note that she needed fish food that cost $2.00.\n  5. Although she bought 20 fish, the problem does not provide the cost of each fish. We can therefore assume that she did not pay for the fish.\n  6. Add up the costs from steps 1 to 4 to get the total amount she spent.\n\nLet's summarize the costs:\n  - Aquarium: $10\n  - Rocks: $5 \n  - Corals: $6\n  - Fish food: $2\n\nThen add up these amounts to get the total amount she spent."
