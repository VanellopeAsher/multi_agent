However, to do this, we need to know the total length of ribbon she has available. Could you provide this information?"

Therefore, she can use 12 inches of ribbon to make a bow for each gift.\n\nWould you like me to execute the Python code to confirm this calculation?"

My final decision is, therefore, in line with their solution.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12.0}** inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
