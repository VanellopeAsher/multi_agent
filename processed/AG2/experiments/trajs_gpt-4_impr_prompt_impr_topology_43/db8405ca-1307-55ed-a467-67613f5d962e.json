Calculate the cost of the tables: Multiply the number of tables (40) by the cost per table ($200). \n2. Calculate the cost of the roof frames: Multiply the number of roof frames (20) by the cost per frame ($100).\n3. Add the total cost of tables and the total cost of roof frames to get the total amount Ali has to pay. \n\nLet me calculate it."
