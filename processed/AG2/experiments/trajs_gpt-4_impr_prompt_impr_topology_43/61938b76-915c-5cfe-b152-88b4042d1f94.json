In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To determine the amount of change Carl will receive, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. First, calculate the total number of biscuits Carl purchased. Since there are 10 packages and each package contains 6 biscuits, Carl bought a total of 10 * 6 = 60 biscuits.\n2. Then, compute the total cost of these biscuits. Given that each biscuit is priced at $0.10, the total cost will be 60 * $0.10 = $6.00.\n3. Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount of money Carl handed over ($10.00) to find out how much change he will get back. This will be $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00. \n\nTherefore, Carl will receive $4.00 in change."
