After obtaining the total amount of candy, we divide it by the number of people sharing, that is, 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron).\n\nFollowing these steps should provide us the amount of candy each person would have."

The calculations used by Agent_Code_Executor are in line with the solution proposed by Agent_Problem_Solver. Both agents did not make any assumptions and worked strictly with the information provided in the problem statement. Therefore, I approve this as the final solution.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 4.0"
