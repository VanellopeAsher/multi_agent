To find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 55 from 90, resulting in 35 goals.\n3. Finally, we add all the goals scored by each teenager (Richie + Mark + Anna), to find the total number of goals. \n\nLet's calculate it."

The initial problem required basic mathematical operations - subtraction and addition - to find the goal count for each individual and finally the total count. The Python code implemented it properly and found the sum of the goals to be 185, which matches the final solution provided by Agent_Problem_Solver. Good job everyone. Let's move on to the next problem."
