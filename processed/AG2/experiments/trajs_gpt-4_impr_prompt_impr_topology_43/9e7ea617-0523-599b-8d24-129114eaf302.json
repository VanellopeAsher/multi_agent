      "content": "Here are the steps required to arrive at the solution:\n1. Identify the heights of the individual trees. According to the problem, the first tree is 60 feet tall, and the second tree is 50 feet taller than the first tree. Hence, the second tree's height is 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet.\n2. Add the heights of the first two trees to get the combined height. From step 1, we add 60 feet (first tree) + 110 feet (second tree) = 170 feet.\n3. From the problem, the height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the first two trees. Hence, we multiply the combined height obtained in step 2 by 2. \n   Thus, the tallest tree's height is 170 feet * 2 = 340 feet."

Agent Problem Solver's theoretical approach:\n   - The problem was logically dissected and the solution was clearly explained. The height of the tallest tree was correctly calculated as being 340 feet tall.\n\n2. Agent Code Executor's code implementation:\n   - The code was clearly written and readable. It correctly follows the logic outlined by Agent Problem Solver, and when executed, it correctly outputs the height of the tallest tree as 340 feet.\n\nThe problem has been resolved. The height of the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard is 340 feet. Both problem-solving approaches were logically sound and accurate. Well done, team!"
