So, the total cost of petunias in one basket will be 30 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $90.00.\n\nSimilarly, there are 20 sweet potato vines in one basket and each vine costs $2.50. So, the total cost of sweet potato vines in one basket will be 20 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $50.00.\n\nAdding these together, the cost of the plants for one basket is $90.00 + $50.00 = $140.00.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total cost for the 50 baskets.\n\nTo find the total cost for the 50 baskets, multiply the cost per basket by the number of baskets: $140.00/basket * 50 baskets = $7000.00. \n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $7000.00 filling all 50 hanging baskets."

      "content": "Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor provided correct solutions to the task. Katherine will indeed spend $7000.00 to fill all 50 hanging baskets. Agent Problem Solver first calculated the cost of plants for a single basket and then multiplied it by the total number of baskets to find the overall cost, which is a logical and efficient approach. Agent Code Executor, on the other hand, solved the task by writing Python code which makes the same calculations as in Agent Problem Solver's approach. The output of the code, 7000.0, matches the result provided by Agent Problem Solver, which is also correct. So, the final answer is Katherine will spend $7000.00 filling all 50 hanging baskets."

This task was a straightforward multiplication problem where the cost of items in one basket was calculated first, and then the total cost was found by multiplying this by the number of baskets. Well done, everyone."
