Let's say A is the amount of money from the $10 bill. \n\nHere's how I would solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Assume the total amount of money Ali had originally is X. \nGiven that Ali had $120 ($20 x 6), the equation will be X = A + 120. \n\nStep 2: Ali gave his sister half of the amount, so the remaining is X/2. \n\nStep 3: Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Since Ali has $32 left after buying dinner, that means X/2 * 3/5 = X/2 - 32.\n\nStep 4: From this equation, you can solve for X. \n\nStep 5: Substitute X into equation X = A + 120 to find A. \n\nStep 6: Since A is the amount of money from $10 bills, find the number of $10 bills by dividing A by 10. This is the solution to the problem."

      "content": "Both agents have presented their solutions, so I will now verify their proposals. \n\nAgent Problem Solver came up with a solution using algebraic equations. The first step is to define the variable X as the total amount of money Ali originally had. The money from the $10 bills is represented by A, and it is given that Ali also has $120 from $20 bills. So the total amount of money is A + 120 = X. \n\nAfter giving half of the total money to his sister, Ali is left with X/2. From this remaining amount, he uses 3/5 to buy dinner, leaving him $32. This situation is represented as X/2 * 2/5 = 32. By solving these equations, we can find the value of A which represents the total money from the $10 bills. \n\nTo find out the number of $10 bills, A is divided by 10.\n\nAgent Problem Solver’s work is mathematically correct. The same reasoning was applied by the Agent Code Executor with the addition of implementing it in python by using the sympy library for solving the equations system. The package was used to define the symbols x and a and then solve the equations as per Agent Problem Solver’s solution.\n\nThe Agent Code Executor returned an output value of 4, indicating that Ali originally had 4 $10 bills.\n\nGiven that the solutions are consistent and no other inputs have been assumed, the final solution is valid.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND**   \\boxed{4}."
