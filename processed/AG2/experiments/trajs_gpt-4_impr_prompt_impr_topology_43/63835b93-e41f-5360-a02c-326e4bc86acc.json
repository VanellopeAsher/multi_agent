Since the kitten needed 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $30 = $60. So, the total for neutering and vaccines is $150 + $60 = $210.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cost of the broken vases. Each vase costs $15 and the kitten broke 3 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the vases is 3 * $15 = $45.\n\nStep 3: Finally, add the costs calculated in steps 1 and 2 to arrive at the total cost. Hence, the total cost is $210 (from step 1) + $45 (from step 2) = $255. We conclude that the kitten has cost Leah $255 so far."
