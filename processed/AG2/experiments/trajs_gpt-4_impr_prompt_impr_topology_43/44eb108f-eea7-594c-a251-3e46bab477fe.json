Because we know 1 foot equals 12 inches, you can calculate the total length in inches by multiplying the length in feet by 12.  \n2. Then, to find the length of each piece, divide the total length in inches by the number of pieces.\n\nFollowing these steps will give you the length of each piece in inches."
