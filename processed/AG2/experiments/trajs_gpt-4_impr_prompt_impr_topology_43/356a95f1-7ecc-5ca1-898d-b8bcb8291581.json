      "content": "Let's represent this problem mathematically.\n\nWe know that Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence between them.\n\nLet's denote the length of the fence for Sam as 'S' and the length of the fence for Harry as 'H'.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Harry has 80 feet more of fence than Sam, which can be represented as:\nH = S + 80  ------   equation (1)\n\nAlso, the total length of the fence is given to be 200 feet. If we add the length of the fences for Sam and Harry, we should get 200 feet, which can be represented as:\nS + H = 200     ------  equation (2)\n\nNow we have 2 equations (1 and 2). We can substitute equation (1) into equation (2) to solve for 'S' (the length of the fence for Sam).\n\nOnce we know 'S', we can substitute it back into equation (1) to get the length of fence for Harry."
