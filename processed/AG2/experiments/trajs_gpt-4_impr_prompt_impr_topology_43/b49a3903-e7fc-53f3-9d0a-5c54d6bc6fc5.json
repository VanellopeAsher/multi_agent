For the red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row. This gives us `36 / 6 = 6` rows of red tulips.\n2. For the blue tulips, we do the same thing, giving us `24 / 8 = 3` rows of blue tulips.\n3. For the yellow tulips, we also do the same calculation, giving us `30 / 5 = 6` rows of yellow tulips.\n\nNow we add up all the rows to get the total number of rows Jackson will plant: `6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 6 (yellow) = 15` total rows."
