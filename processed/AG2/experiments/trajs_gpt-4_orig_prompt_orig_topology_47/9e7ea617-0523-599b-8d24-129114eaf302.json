You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 60 feet, and the second tree has a height of 50 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined.

Since the problem is given in an algebraic format, it can be solved using Python code directly.\n\nThe height of the second tree can be represented as the height of the shortest tree plus 50. This gives us `shortest_tree + 50`. \n\nThe height of the tallest tree is twice the sum of the heights of the shortest and second tree. This can be represented as 2*(shortest_tree + second_tree).\n\nLet's put this in code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# declare the variable for the shortest tree\nshortest_tree = symbols('s')\n\n# equations based on the problem\nsecond_tree = shortest_tree + 50\ntallest_tree = 2 * (shortest_tree + second_tree)\n\n# substitute shortest tree height into the equation\ntallest_tree_height = tallest_tree.subs(shortest_tree, 60)\n\nprint(tallest_tree_height)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we can get the height of the tallest tree."
