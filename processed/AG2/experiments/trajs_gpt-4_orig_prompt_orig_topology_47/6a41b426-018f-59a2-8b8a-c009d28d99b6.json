You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is understanding the ratio of distances John runs for different days in a week. \n\nLet's denote the distance John runs in a day for three times a week as x miles. According to the problem, he runs half as much the other two days he runs, that's 0.5x miles each day. The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of these distances, which equals to 60 miles. We can get the equation: 3x + 2*0.5x = 60. Now let's solve for this equation."
