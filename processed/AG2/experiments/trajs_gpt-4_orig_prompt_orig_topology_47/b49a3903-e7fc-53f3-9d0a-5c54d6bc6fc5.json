You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "First, we need to find out how many rows of each color Jackson will plant. Then we sum all the rows. \n\nNumber of rows for each color of tulips is given by the total number of tulips of the color divided by the number of tulips per row, which is unique for each color. \n\nHere what we can do:\n1. Calculate the number of red rows by dividing the total number of red tulips (36) by the number that can fit in a row (6). \n2. Similarly, calculate the number of blue rows by dividing the total number of blue tulips (24) by the number that can fit in a row (8). \n3. Calculate the number of yellow rows by dividing the total number of yellow tulips (30) by the number that can fit in a row (5). \n\nOnce we have these figures, we can simply add them together to get the total number of rows.\n\nWe can write Python code directly to solve this problem. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nred_tulips = 36\nblue_tulips = 24\nyellow_tulips = 30\n\n# Number that can fit in a row for each color\nred_in_a_row = 6\nblue_in_a_row = 8\nyellow_in_a_row = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of rows of each color\nred_rows = red_tulips // red_in_a_row\nblue_rows = blue_tulips // blue_in_a_row\nyellow_rows = yellow_tulips // yellow_in_a_row\n\n# Total rows\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + yellow_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you'll get the total number of rows that Jackson will plant. You can then use this information to plan and arrange the garden."
