You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery packet of graham crackers can be used to create the base for 8 big smores.

Every packet of graham crackers can make 8 big smores, so find out how many packets are needed based on the total demand. A box contains 3 packets, therefore, find out how many boxes are required. The result should be rounded up because we can only count boxes as integers.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# numbers of graham crackers required for adults and children\nsmores_per_child = 2\nchildren = 9\nsmores_per_adult = 1\nadults = 6\n\n# smores produced per packet and number of packets per box\nsmores_per_packet = 8\npackets_per_box = 3\n\n# calculate total smores required\ntotal_smores = smores_per_child * children + smores_per_adult * adults\n\n# calculate total number of packets required\ntotal_packets = sp.ceiling(total_smores / smores_per_packet)\n\n# calculate total number of boxes required\ntotal_boxes = sp.ceiling(total_packets / packets_per_box)\n\nprint(\"Total boxes of graham crackers required: \", total_boxes)\n```"
