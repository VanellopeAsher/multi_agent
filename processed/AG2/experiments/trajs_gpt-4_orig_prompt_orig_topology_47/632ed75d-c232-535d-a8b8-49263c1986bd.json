  "problem": "There are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "Given that the second aircraft makes 44 flights to Poland which represent half the total flights made by the first aircraft each day, we can determine the total number of flights made by the first aircraft by multiplying the flights made by the second aircraft by 2.\n\nThree-fourths of the flights made by the aircraft fly to Greece, while the remaining quarter is split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, we can determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France by calculating half of the quarter of the total daily flights made by the aircraft.\n\nLet's put these ideas into code. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of flights by second aircraft\nflights_second_aircraft = 44\n\n# total number of flights by first aircraft\ntotal_flights_first_aircraft = 2 * flights_second_aircraft\n\n# flights to Greece by first aircraft\ngreece_flights_first_aircraft = 3 / 4 * total_flights_first_aircraft\n\n# remaining flights by first aircraft\nremaining_flights_first_aircraft = total_flights_first_aircraft - greece_flights_first_aircraft\n\n# flights to France by first aircraft\nfrance_flights_first_aircraft = remaining_flights_first_aircraft / 2\n\nprint(france_flights_first_aircraft)\n```\n\nIf the number of flights are required to be integers, we may consider rounding up or down and then verify if the total number of flights sums up correctly."
