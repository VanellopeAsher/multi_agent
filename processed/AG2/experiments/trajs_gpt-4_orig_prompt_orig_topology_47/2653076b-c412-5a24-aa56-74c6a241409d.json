You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.50 apiece, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4.50 apiece and 13 blueberry muffins that were $1.50 apiece.

Then we discount the total cost by 10% to get the final cost.\n\nNow let's use Python to do what we've just described.\n\n```python\n# Initial cost for each type of product\ncroissants_cost = 5 * 3.50\ncinnamon_rolls_cost = 4 * 2.50\nmini_quiches_cost = 3 * 4.50\nblueberry_muffins_cost = 13 * 1.50\n\n# Total initial cost\ntotal_initial_cost = croissants_cost + cinnamon_rolls_cost + mini_quiches_cost + blueberry_muffins_cost\ndiscount = 10 / 100\n\n# Final cost after the discount\nfinal_cost = total_initial_cost * (1 - discount)\n\n# Print the final cost\nprint(final_cost)\n```"
