You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

We can calculate this step by step and use the Python sympy library to handle the arithmetic. Let's begin.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# the number of people invited by Martha\ninvited = 12*6 + 15*4\n\n# the number of people that couldn't come due to illness\nill = 16 \n\n# the number of people that had previous commitments is 1/4 of those who were ill\nprevious_commitments = ill / 4\n\n# calculating the total number of people who show up for Martha's party\nattendees = invited - ill - previous_commitments \n\n# print the result\nprint(attendees)\n```"
