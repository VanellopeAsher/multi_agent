You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday and Tuesday.\n2. Use this information to find out `t`.\n3. From the total hours spent writing (104 hours), deduct the hours spent writing on Monday and Tuesday to get the hours spent on Wednesday.\n4. Given that one article takes 4 hours to write, use the hours spent on Wednesday to determine `w`.\n5. Finally, find the ratio of `w` to `t` to find out how many times more articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday than on Tuesday.\n\nLet's proceed to compute this in Python."

If `ratio` is larger than 1, it means Meredith wrote more articles on Wednesday than on Tuesday. The amount `ratio` exceeds 1 is the number of times she wrote more articles on Wednesday than on Tuesday. Otherwise, she wrote less articles on Wednesday than on Tuesday."
