You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

We subtract these days from the total to get how many days Billy actually works. Then we can calculate how many people Billy helps per day, and multiply this by the number of days he works to get the total number of people he helps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# calculate the total number of days from March 1 to April 19\ntotal_days = 31 + 19 \n\n# calculate the number of days Billy takes off\ndays_off = sp.Rational(20, 100)*total_days\n\n# calculate the number of days Billy works\nworking_days = total_days - days_off\n\n# calculate how many people Billy helps per day\npeople_per_day = 2 * 3.5\n\n# calculate the total number of people Billy helps\ntotal_people = people_per_day * working_days\n\nprint(total_people)\n```"
