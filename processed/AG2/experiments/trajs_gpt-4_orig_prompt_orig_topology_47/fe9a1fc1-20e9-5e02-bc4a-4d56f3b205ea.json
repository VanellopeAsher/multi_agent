You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKatarina has 5 less cookies than Max has.

Subtract ten from the number of cookies Max has to get the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.\n3. Calculate the number of cookies Summer has by adding 23 to the number of cookies Max has.\n4. Finally, sum up the number of cookies each person has.\n\nNow let's write the Python code to calculate. We will be using the sympy package to print exact rational numbers instead of decimal approximation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define how many cookies Katarina has\nkatarina_cookies = Rational(68) # Because 6.8 of ten cookies equals 68 cookies \n\n# Calculate how many cookies Max has\nmax_cookies = katarina_cookies / Rational(1.2)\n\n# Calculate how many cookies the Cookie Monster has\nmonster_cookies = max_cookies - 10\n\n# Calculate how many cookies Summer has\nsummer_cookies = max_cookies + 23\n\n# Calculate the total cookies\ntotal_cookies = katarina_cookies + max_cookies + monster_cookies + summer_cookies\n\nprint(total_cookies)\n```"
