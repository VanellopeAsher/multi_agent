You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.

      "content": "Since the number of water balloons they filled up in total is 10 packs times 100 balloons per pack, and the remaining number of balloons is 120, the number of balloons they threw can be found by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved directly using Python code. Let's write a program for this.\n\n```python\n# total number of balloons\ntotal_balloons = 10 * 100\n\n# number of balloons left\nremaining_balloons = 120\n\n# number of balloons thrown\nthrown_balloons = total_balloons - remaining_balloons\n\nprint(thrown_balloons)\n```\n\nThis program will output the number of balloons thrown."
