You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "The key idea to solve the problem is to establish some relationships based on the given conditions. Specifically, we know that 2/3 of the unicorns in Scotland are female and there are 6 of them. Thus, we can calculate the total number of unicorns in Scotland. Then, using the condition that 1/3 of the total unicorns are in Scotland, we can calculate the number of unicorns in the world.\n\nLet's write up the solution in Python using sympy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the number of female unicorns in Scotland\nnum_female_unicorns_scotland = 6\n\n# compute the total number of unicorns in Scotland\nnum_unicorns_scotland = num_female_unicorns_scotland / (2/3)\n\n# compute the total number of unicorns in the world\nnum_unicorns_world = num_unicorns_scotland / (1/3)\n\nprint(num_unicorns_world)\n```"
