You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to start by calculating the total cost the trader spent on purchasing and transporting the bags of wheat. The difference between the total amount he earned from selling the bags and the total cost will equal to his profit, which is given. We can then use this information to write an equation that we will solve for the number of bags he sold.\n\nHere is how I'll go about this:\n\n1. Let's denote the number of bags by \"n\".\n2. The total cost of buying the bags is $20*n.\n3. The total cost of transporting the bags is $2*n.\n4. Hence, the total cost is $20*n + $2*n = $22*n.\n5. The total amount the trader earned from selling the bags is $30*n.\n6. And the trader made a profit which is the amount earned minus the cost, hence $30*n - $22*n = $400\n7. Finally, we need to solve the resulting equation $8*n = $400 for n.\n\nWe can use Python to solve this equation."
