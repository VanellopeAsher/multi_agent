You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

      "content": "Key Idea: \n\nWe can create expressions to represent the total sales of small stuffed animals and large stuffed animals, and then solve the resulting equation to find the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n\nPython Code:\n\nLet's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'l'. We know from the problem that:\n- The price of small stuffed animals is $40. So, the total price for small stuffed animals sale is $40s.\n- Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, which is $120. So, the total price for large stuffed animals sale is $120l.\n- The number of small animals sold is twice the number of large ones. So, we have an equation here: s = 2l.\n- The total sales of today is $1200. So, we have another equation here: $40s + $120l = $1200.\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations for 's' and 'l'.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\ns, l = symbols('s l')\n\n# The price of small stuffed animals is $40.\nsmall_price = 40\n# Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, which is $120.\nlarge_price = 3 * small_price\n# The number of small animals sold is twice the number of large ones.\neq1 = Eq(s, 2*l)\n# The total sales of today is $1200.\neq2 = Eq(small_price*s + large_price*l, 1200)\n\n# Solve these two equations.\nsol = solve((eq1,eq2), (s, l))\n\nprint(sol[s], sol[l])\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of both small and large stuffed animals sold today."
