You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAmora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 150 more corn chips than the number the others got.

Given that Amora and Lainey got 700 corn chips each, this means that Collins got 700 + 150 corn chips.\n\nTo find out how many corn chips there were altogether, we just add the number of corn chips each person got.\n\nLet's calculate that with Python.\n\n```python\n# Define how many corn chips Amora and Lainey got\namora_lainey_chips = 700\n\n# Define how many corn chips Collins got\ncollins_chips = amora_lainey_chips + 150\n\n# Define the total number of corn chips\ntotal_chips = (amora_lainey_chips * 2) + collins_chips\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_chips)\n```"
