You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn is a carpenter.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem is to find the total costs of tables and roof frames by multiplying their respective quantities with their prices, and then sum these two costs together.\n\n```python\ntables = 40 * 200\nroof_frames = 20 * 100\ntotal_cost = tables + roof_frames\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThe code above first computes the cost of the tables by multiplying the number of tables (40) with their price ($200). It then computes the cost of the roof frames by multiplying the number of roof frames (20) with their price ($100). Then what Ali has to pay John is obtained by adding the cost of tables and roof frames together."
