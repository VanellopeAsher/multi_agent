You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwo girls each got 1/4 of the 32 liters of water.

Then we subtract the boy's share and the girls' total share from the total amount of water to find the amount of water left.\n\nLet's use Python's sympy library to solve this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the total amount of water\ntotal_water = 32\n\n# Define the share of each girl\ngirl_share = total_water * Rational(1, 4)\n\n# Define the total share of the girls\ntotal_girl_share = 2 * girl_share\n\n# Define the share of the boy\nboy_share = 8\n\n# Calculate the remaining water\nremaining_water = total_water - total_girl_share - boy_share\n\nprint(remaining_water)\n```"
