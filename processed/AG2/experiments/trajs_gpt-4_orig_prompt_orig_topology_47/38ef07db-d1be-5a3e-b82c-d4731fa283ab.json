You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party.

      "content": "The key here is to understand that the total length of crepe paper will be equal to the sum of the lengths of all sides of the rectangular fence.\n\nSo, given a rectangle of length `l` and breadth `b`, the perimeter (P) is given by `P = 2*(l+b)`. In this case, `l=20.5 ft` and `b=15.5 ft`.\n\nHence, we can calculate the total length of crepe paper required using python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the variables\nl = 20.5 # length of the rectangle\nb = 15.5 # breadth of the rectangle\n\n# calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nP = 2*(l + b) # formula for the perimeter of a rectangle\n\nprint(P)\n```"
