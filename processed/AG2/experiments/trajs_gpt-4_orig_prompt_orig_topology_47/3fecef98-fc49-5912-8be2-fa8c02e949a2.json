You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed.

The area of a rectangle (the shape of both the comforter and duvet cover) is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. \n\nFor the comforter, we need two pieces of fabric that are each 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore each piece is 8 feet by 10 feet in size. \n\nFor the duvet cover, it's 9 feet by 11 feet in size.\n\nWe add up the area of all these pieces to find the total fabric Jim needs to buy.\n\nLet's calculate this in python."
