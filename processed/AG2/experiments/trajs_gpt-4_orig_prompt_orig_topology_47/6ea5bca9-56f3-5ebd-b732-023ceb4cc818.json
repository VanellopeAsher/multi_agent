You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.

According to the problem we then have:\n\n1. B = S + 0.12\n2. S = 3P\n3. B + S + P = 3.41\n\nSubstitute what B and S equals from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3, and then we can solve for P. Once P is known, we can substitute P back into equation 2 and 1 to solve for S and B. Note that since we want the actual number of cards Becca has we will convert back from hundreds to units at the end. \n\nAlso note that we are told \"Steve has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has,\" which, according to what S equals, means we round down PJ's cards to make it a multiple of 3 since the amount of cards must be an integer. Let's now solve the problem in Python."
