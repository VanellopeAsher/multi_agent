You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nThe problem mentions that half of the total paint used is yellow, and the remaining half is equally divided between red, white, and purple. Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can calculate the amount of each color used.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Calculate the total amount of yellow paint used, which is half of the total paint.\n2. Subtract the yellow paint from the total amount to find what's left for red, white, and purple collectively.\n3. Divide the remaining amount by three to find the amount used for each of the other colors.\n\nLet's implement this in Python: \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total amount of paint\ntotal_paint = 12\n\n# calculate the yellow paint\nyellow_paint = total_paint / 2 \n\n# calculate the remaining paint for red, white, and purple\nremaining_paint = total_paint - yellow_paint \n\n# calculate the amount of red paint\nred_paint = remaining_paint / 3\n\nprint(red_paint)\n```"
