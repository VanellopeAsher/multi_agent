You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "Key Idea: \nWe can find out the total time John spent by adding up all the activities time and then use that to calculate the sightseeing time based on the percentage given.\n\nStep 1: Calculate total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows.\n- We know John spent 60 hours boating, half that time swimming which will be 30 hours, and he watched 30 shows which were 20 hours each resulting in 600 hours.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total time from shows which is 30% of total time.\n- If 600 hours that John watched shows is 30% of total time, we can find the total time by dividing the shows time by 0.30.\n\nStep 3: Solve for sightseeing time\n- After calculating total time, we know John spent 40% of this total time sightseeing. We can calculate sightseeing time by multiplying total time by 0.40. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculations. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# step 1\nboating_time = 60\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshows_time = 30 * 20\ntotal_activities_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time\n\n# step 2\ntotal_time = shows_time / 0.30\n\n#step 3\nsightseeing_time = total_time * 0.40\n\nsp.pprint(sightseeing_time)\n```"
