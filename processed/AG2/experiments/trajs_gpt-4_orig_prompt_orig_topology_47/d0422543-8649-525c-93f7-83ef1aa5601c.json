You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarver just turned 60 years old, which makes him 8 years less than twice the age of his son.

      "content": "Let's denote Carver's son's age as x years. According to the information provided in the problem, we can form the equation 2x - 8 = 60 to represent the relationship between Carver's and his son's age. We can then solve this equation to find the son's age.\n\nWe can solve this equation directly using Python:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\nequation = Eq(2*x - 8, 60)\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nHere, `symbols` function is used to define the variable x. `Eq` is used to represent the equation and `solve` is used to solve the equation for the variable x. The result `solution[0]` gives the age of his son."
