  "problem": "George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000.5. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGeorge needs to pay for dental work.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem lies in two parts. \n\nThe first is to calculate the total cost of the dental work. This includes the cost of 2 implants, one of which includes the cost of the porcelain crown, minus the deposit George has already paid. \n\nThe second part converts the total cost to working hours. This can be achieved by dividing the total cost by George's hourly wage. \n\nWe can solve this problem directly using Python code. Let's do it.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# definitions\nimplant_cost = 2000.5\ncrown_cost = 500.5\ndeposit = 600\nwage = 15.3\n\n# calculation\ntotal_cost = 2 * implant_cost + crown_cost - deposit\nworking_hours = total_cost / wage\n\n# output\nprint(working_hours)\n```"
