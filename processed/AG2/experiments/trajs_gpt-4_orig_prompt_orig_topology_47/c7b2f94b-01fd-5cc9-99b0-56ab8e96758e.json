  "problem": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it.

Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "Key idea: We can form an equation to represent the total number of apples they gathered. Then we can solve the equation to obtain the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, so the number of apples that she gathers from the shortest trees is `30/2 = 15`.\n2. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so Joanne's sister gathers `2*30 = 60` apples from the tallest trees.\n3. Joanne and her sister have gathered a combined total of 500 apples. From the problem we know\n   ```\n   Joanne_total = Joanne_tallest + Joanne_shortest + Joanne_avearage\n   Joanne's_sister_total = Sister_tallest + Sister_shortest\n   ```\n   and\n   ```\n   Total = Joanne_total + Joanne's_sister_total\n   ```\n   where\n   ```\n   Joanne_tallest = 30\n   Joanne_average = 350\n   Joanne_shortest = 15\n   sister_tallest = 60\n   ```\n   We can substitute these variables into the equation to get\n   ```\n   500 = (30 + 350 + 15) + (60 + Sister_shortest)\n   ```\n   Solve this equation to get the number of apples that Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.\n\nLet's use Python to solve this equations."

Let's get back on track. \n\nI'll set up the equation and solve for the number of apples that Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees. \n\nLet's denote the number of apples that Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees as S.\n\nThe equation will be like: \n```\n500 = (30 + 15 + 350) + (60 + S)\n```\n\nWe can solve this equation to find S. Let me write the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# define the symbol\nS = symbols('S')\n\n# define the equation\nequation = (30 + 15 + 350) + (60 + S) - 500\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation)\n\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the number of apples that Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.
