  "problem": "A nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they use on the first day?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50.

      "content": "Key idea: The problem can be solved with a Python code by forming equations based on the problem's condition and then solving it.\n\nThe problem can be modeled into two equations. Let X and Y be the number of bandages used on the first day and the second day respectively.\n\nHere are the relations what we can draw from the problem:\n1. Y = X - 10\n2. They started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages, so they had 19+50 bandages at the beginning;\n3. On the second day, they used Y bandages, so we have 19+50-Y bandages left;\n4. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs which is 2*50=100 bandages. So, they have 19+50-Y+100 bandages in total;\n5. On the third day, they used half a pack. This means they used 50/2=25 bandages. So we have 19+50-Y+100-25=78 bandages left;\n6. Solve the equation 19+50-Y+100-25=78 for Y and substitute the value of Y from equation one into it to solve the system of equations.\n\nWe can solve these two equations to get the answer. The Python code needed is below:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the symbols\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# define the equations\neq1 = Eq(y, x - 10)\neq2 = Eq(19+50-y+100-25, 78)\n\n# solve the system of equations\nsol = solve((eq1,eq2), (x, y))\nprint(\"Bandages used on the first day:\", sol[x])\n```\n\nNow let's go ahead and run this code to get the answer."
