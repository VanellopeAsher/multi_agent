You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nLast night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting.

Then we can solve this equation for C2. From there, we can find W2, C1, and total.\n\nLet's do this by Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n#  define symbols\nC2 = symbols('C2')\n\n#  define equations\nequations = Eq(10+ 3 * C2 + C2 + 3 + C2, 10 + 4 * C2 + 3)\n\n#  solve equation\nC2 = solve(equations, C2)\n\nprint('Number of cougars killed on second day, C2 =', C2[0])\n\n# calculate number of wolves on second day and cougars on first day\nW2 = 3 * C2[0]\nC1 = C2[0] + 3\nprint('Number of wolves killed on second day, W2 =', W2)\nprint('Number of cougars killed on the first day, C1 =', C1)\n\n# calculate total\nTotal= 10 + W2 + C1 + C2[0]\nprint('Total number of animals killed is:', Total)\n```\nYou can run the above code and see the results.
