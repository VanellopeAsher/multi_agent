You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTara bought several packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to first understand the situation. Tara bought 5-bag packs for $4 each and then earned a profit by selling these bags for $8 each. The given profit is $160.\n\nThe cost price of a bag is $4 / 5 = $0.8, and the selling price of a bag is $8. The profit on a bag is the selling price - cost price. \n\nLet's assume that x is the number of packs Tara has bought.\n\nSo the profit of each bag times the total number of bags (which is 5x) should be equal to the total profit, $160.\n\nThe equation that can be formed from the above information is:\n(8 - 0.8) * 5x = 160\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the number of packs Tara bought.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# define the equation\neq = (8 - 0.8) * 5*x - 160\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = sp.solve(eq, x)\n\nprint(solution)\n```"

The cost of each bag is $4/5 = $0.8 and hence the profit for each bag = $8 - $0.8 = $7.2\n\nIf the total profit is $160, then the number of packs she sold is $160 / $7.2.\n\nSo, Tara bought and sold $160 / $7.2 packs.\n\nLet's clear this up by calculating the number of packs.\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of packs\nnum_packs = 160 / 7.2\n\nprint(num_packs)\n```"

She then sold each bag for $8, making a profit of $8 - $0.8 = $7.2 per bag.\n\nThe total profit she made was $160. \n\nTo find out how many bags she sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag - so $160 / $7.2.\n\nSince each pack contains 5 bags, we must further divide this result by 5 to find out how many packs of bags she bought and sold.\n\nLet's correct this calculation.\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of packs\nnum_bags = 160 / 7.2\nnum_packs = num_bags / 5\n\nprint(num_packs)\n```"

This means she made a profit of $8 - $0.80 = 7.20 per bag.\n\nGiven that her total profit was $160, the number of bags she must have sold is $160 / $7.20.\n\nSince each pack contains 5 bags, the number of packs she bought is equal to the number of bags divided by 5.\n\nLet's redo this calculation.\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of bags sold\nnum_bags = 160 / 7.2\n# calculate the number of packs bought\nnum_packs = num_bags / 5\n\nprint(num_packs)\n```"

We divide the number of bags by 5 to get the number of packs.\n\nWe will write a program to illustrate this.\n\n```python\n# calculate the number of bags sold\nnum_bags = 160 / 7.2\n# round up to the nearest whole number because she can't sell fractional bags\nnum_bags = round(num_bags)\n# calculate the number of packs bought (and sold)\nnum_packs = num_bags / 5\n# round up to the nearest whole number because she can't buy fractional packs\nnum_packs = round(num_packs)\n\nprint(num_packs)\n```"

The profit per bag = Selling price per bag - Cost price per bag = $8 - $0.8 = $7.2.\n2. Tara made a total profit of $160.\n\nThe total number of bags sold, n, can be found by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag, i.e., n = $160 / $7.2. And since each pack contains 5 bags, the number of packs Tara bought is n / 5.\n\nHowever, the result should be an integer number, as the number of bags sold or packs bought cannot be a fraction. \n\nLet's correct this calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Number of bags sold\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Each pack contains 5 bags\nbags_per_pack = 5    \n\n# Tara made a total profit of 160\ntotal_profit = 160  \n\n# She made a profit of 7.2 per bag\nprofit_per_bag = 7.2\n\n# So, number of bags sold = total profit / profit per bag\nbags_sold = total_profit / profit_per_bag\n\n# Equating this to n (our symbol), we can solve for n\nequation = Eq(n, bags_sold)\n\n# Solve for n\nbag_solution = solve(equation, n)\n\n# Since each pack contains 5 bags, the number of packs Tara bought is n / 5\npacks_bought = bag_solution[0] / bags_per_pack\n\n# However, this result should be an integer, as the number of bags or packs cannot be a fraction.\n# Since it's not possible to buy a fraction of a pack, if the result is a fraction, we should take the ceiling of the result. \n# This is because even if Tara bought a fraction of the total packs, she would still have to pay for the full pack.\n\nfrom math import ceil\n\n# Number of packs rounded up\npacks_bought_rounded = ceil(packs_bought)\n\nprint(packs_bought_rounded)\n```"
