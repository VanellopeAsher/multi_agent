  "problem": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

      "content": "Key idea: Calculate the total cost of all items and then subtract this total from Kelly's budget to find out the amount of money she has left.\n\nTo calculate the total cost, she bought 5 packs of bacon each costing $10.5 / 5. So, six packets of chicken each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon i.e., 2 * ($10.5 / 5). She also bought 3 packs of strawberries costing $4.5 each and 7 packs of apples each costing $4.5 / 2.\n\nCalculating separately:\n- The total cost of bacon is 5 * ($10.5 / 5).\n- The total cost of chicken is 6 * 2 * ($10.5 / 5).\n- The total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4.5.\n- The total cost of apples is 7 * ($4.5 / 2).\n\nNow sum these and subtract from Kelly's $65 budget will give us the answer.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# price of one pack of bacon\nbacon_price = Rational(10.5) / 5\n# total cost of bacon\nbacon_cost = 5 * bacon_price\n\n# total cost of chicken\nchicken_cost = 6 * 2 * bacon_price\n\n# total cost of strawberries\nstraw_cost = 3 * Rational(4.5)\n\n# price of one pack of apple\napple_price = Rational(4.5) / 2\n# total cost of apples\napple_cost = 7 * apple_price\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = bacon_cost + chicken_cost + straw_cost + apple_cost\n\n# budget left\nbudget_left = Rational(65) - total_cost\nprint(budget_left)\n```\n\nThen you should get the remaining budget."
