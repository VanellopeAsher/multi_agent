You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to find out how much money Peter spent from Sunday through Wednesday by multiplying the number of days with the cost of a wooden action figure. Subtract that from his total money to figure out how much he has left to spend on plastic action figures. Then, find out how many plastic action figures he can buy by dividing the remaining money with the cost of a plastic action figure. Finally, add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to get the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.\n\nLet's solve this problem step by step following the process:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total amount of money Peter spent from Sunday through Wednesday.\nStep 2: Subtract this total from the initial amount of money Peter had.\nStep 3: Determine the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy for the rest of the week.\nStep 4: Add up the number of wooden and plastic action figures.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Initial amount of money Peter has\ninitial_money = 70\n\n# Cost of a wooden action figure\nwooden_action_figure_cost = 5\n\n# Number of days from Sunday through Wednesday\nnum_days = 4\n\n# Amount of money spent on wooden action figures\nmoney_spent_on_wooden = num_days * wooden_action_figure_cost\n\n# Remaining amount of money\nremaining_money = initial_money - money_spent_on_wooden\n\n# Cost of a plastic action figure\nplastic_action_figure_cost = 2.5\n\n# Number of plastic action figures Peter can buy\nnum_plastic_action_figures = remaining_money // plastic_action_figure_cost\n\n# Total number of action figures Peter will have\ntotal_action_figures = num_days + num_plastic_action_figures\n\nprint(total_action_figures)\n```\n\nYou can run the code above to get the answer."
