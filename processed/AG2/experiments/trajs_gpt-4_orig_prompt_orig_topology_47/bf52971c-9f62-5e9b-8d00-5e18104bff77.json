You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAli has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

After finding the total amount, you can then calculate half of this total (the amount he gives to his sister) and the amount of money Ali has left. Additionally, since Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner, we deduce this from what he had left before buying dinner to get the final amount of money Ali has.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Ali's total money\ntotal_money_Ali = 4 * 10 + 6 * 20\n\n# Half of the total money Ali gives his sister\ngiven_to_sister = total_money_Ali / 2\n\n# The remaining money Ali has\nremaining_money_Ali = total_money_Ali - given_to_sister\n\n# The amount Ali uses to buy dinner\nused_for_dinner = remaining_money_Ali * (3 / 5)\n\n# The final amount of money Ali has\nfinal_money_Ali = remaining_money_Ali - used_for_dinner\n\nprint(final_money_Ali)\n```"
