You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $15.00 each and a ballpen at $5.00 each.

We can calculate the total expenditure directly using Python code.\n\nTo find out how much William spent, we will multiply the number of notebooks by their price, and the number of ballpens by their price, and then add these two results together.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Price of each item\nnotebook_price = 15.00\nballpen_price = 5.00\n\n# Quantity of each item bought\nnotebooks_bought = 50\nballpens_bought = 10\n\n# Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = (notebook_price * notebooks_bought) + (ballpen_price * ballpens_bought)\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the total amount William spent on the notebooks and ballpens."
