You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJenna shares her living space with four other people.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Case 1 because it involves straightforward arithmetic calculations that can be directly computed using Python code. We are asked to determine the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill when the monthly bill is $100 and the cost is evenly split among five people, including Jenna. Here's how we can solve it:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly contribution per person by dividing the monthly cost by the number of people.\n2. Multiply the monthly contribution by 12 to get the annual contribution.\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute this:\n\n```python\n# Importing the relevant library for fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the monthly electricity cost\nmonthly_cost = 100\n\n# Define the number of people sharing the cost\nnum_people = 5\n\n# Calculate the monthly contribution per person\nmonthly_contribution_per_person = Rational(monthly_cost, num_people)\n\n# Calculate the annual contribution per person\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_contribution_per_person * 12\n\n# Print the result in a fraction format\nprint(annual_contribution_per_person)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll find the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill. Feel free to proceed with running this code to get the answer."
