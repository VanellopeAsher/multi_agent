In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can leverage the information given to create equations and solve them.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe can solve this problem directly with Python by setting up the equations based on the problem statement.\n\n1. **Understand the groups:**\n   - Since there are 20 kids divided into equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n  \n2. **Calculate the total shells brought by boys:**\n   - Each boy brought 60 shells.\n   - Total shells brought by the boys = Number of boys × shells per boy = 10 × 60.\n\n3. **Determine the shells brought by the girls:**\n   - The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the total number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of shells brought by each girl.\n   - Equation: \\( 10x = \\text{Total shells by boys} + 4.5 \\times \\text{Total shells by boys} \\).\n\nNow we can use Python to solve these equations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Number of boys and shells each brings\nboys = 10\nshells_per_boy = 60\n\n# Total shells by boys\ntotal_shells_boys = boys * shells_per_boy\n\n# Equation for shells brought by each girl\ntotal_shells_girls = total_shells_boys + 4.5 * total_shells_boys\nequation = 10 * x - total_shells_girls\n\n# Solve the equation\nshells_per_girl = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed, it will give us the number of seashells brought by each girl. Let's calculate it: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total shells by boys} = 10 \\times 60 = 600\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Shells brought by girls} = 600 + 4.5 \\times 600 = 600 + 2700 = 3300\n\\]\n\\[\n10x = 3300 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{3300}{10} = 330\n\\]\n\nThus, each girl brought \\(\\boxed{330}\\) seashells."
