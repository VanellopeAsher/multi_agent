You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much total time John spent and use this to find the time he spent sightseeing.\n\n### Key Idea:\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n1. Calculate the total time John spent on activities given in the problem.\n2. Use the percentage information given to find the total time he spent on vacation.\n3. Calculate the time spent sightseeing based on the given percentage.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Determine the total time spent on each activity.\n2. Calculate the total activity time and use the percentage information to find the total vacation time.\n3. Calculate the time spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's solve it using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Set up the known values and equations\nboating_time = 6.6\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\nshow_time = 3 * 2.5\n\nactivity_time = boating_time + swimming_time + show_time\n\n# Set up the equation for total vacation time, T, where 30% of T was the time spent on shows\nT = symbols('T')\nequation = Eq(show_time, 0.3 * T)\n\n# Solve for T\ntotal_vacation_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate the time spent sightseeing (40% of T)\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_vacation_time\n\n# Print the sightseeing time in fraction form if possible\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nWhen you execute the above code, it will calculate the time John spent sightseeing and display it in fractional form. This approach ensures we are using exact values rather than approximate decimals, as specified."
