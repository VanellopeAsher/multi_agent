Today:\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the number of wolves killed today.\n   - Let \\( c \\) be the number of cougars killed today.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Thus, \\( w = 3c \\).\n- Today he killed three fewer cougars than last night. Thus, \\( c = x - 3 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of animals Rick killed today.\n\nGiven Variables:\n- Last night: 10 wolves and \\( x \\) cougars.\n- Today: \\( w = 3c \\) wolves and \\( c = x-3 \\) cougars.\n\nLet's calculate in steps:\n- Express \\( w \\) in terms of \\( x \\): \\( w = 3(x - 3) \\).\n- Calculate the total number of animals killed today: \\( w + c = 3(x - 3) + (x - 3) \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate using these equations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\n#w = 3(x - 3)\n#c = x - 3\nw = 3*(x - 3)\nc = x - 3\n\n# Total animals killed today\ntotal_today = w + c\n\n# Total animals killed last night: 10 + x\n\n# Let's solve the problem\nanimals_yesterday = 10 + x\nanimals_today = total_today\n\n# Total animals over the two days\ntotal_animals = animals_yesterday + animals_today\n\n# Expressing\nresult = solve(total_today + 10 + x, x)\ntotal_animals_calc = total_today.subs(x, result[0]) + 10 + result[0]\nprint(total_animals_calc)\n```\n\nRun this code snippet to find out how many animals Rick killed."
