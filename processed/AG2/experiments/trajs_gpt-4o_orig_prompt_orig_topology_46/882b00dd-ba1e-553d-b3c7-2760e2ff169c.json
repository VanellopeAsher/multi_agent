On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour than brfore. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate both Billy's and Sally's earnings for working 20 hours, considering their respective salary changes over time. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Billy's Current Hourly Wage:**\n    - Billy started at $10 per hour.\n    - After 2 months, he received a $0.50 raise, making his hourly wage $10.50.\n    - On his first anniversary, he received another $1.00 raise, making his current hourly wage $11.50.\n\n2. **Calculate Sally's Current Hourly Wage:**\n    - Sally started at $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n    - After 2 months, she received a $0.50 raise, making her current hourly wage $11.00.\n\n3. **Calculate Earnings for 20 Hours:**\n    - Billy's earnings for 20 hours is \\( 20 \\times 11.50 \\).\n    - Sally's earnings for 20 hours is \\( 20 \\times 11.00 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Earnings:**\n    - The difference is \\( \\text{Billy's earnings} - \\text{Sally's earnings} \\).\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours\nbilly_hourly_wage = 11.50\nbilly_earnings = 20 * billy_hourly_wage\n\n# Calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours\nsally_hourly_wage = 11.00\nsally_earnings = 20 * sally_hourly_wage\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nThis code will output the difference in earnings directly. Let's calculate it."
