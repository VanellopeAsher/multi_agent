The next day, the price increased to $25 per fruit, but the store also offered a 15% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 15 apples.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the final cost of the apples purchased by Clara and Sheila on their respective days and then find the difference between those amounts. \n\n### Key Idea:\nWe can solve this by calculating the total amount paid by each person using simple arithmetic and then finding the difference.\n\n### Step by Step Solution:\n1. Calculate the total cost for Clara:\n   - Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.\n   - Total cost = \\(15 \\times 15\\).\n   - Clara used a $3 voucher, so we subtract $3 from the total.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for Sheila:\n   - Sheila bought 15 apples at $25 each.\n   - Total cost before discount = \\(15 \\times 25\\).\n   - There is a 15% discount on the total cost for Sheila, which we need to subtract from the total.\n\n3. Calculate the difference between the amounts paid by Clara and Sheila.\n\nLet's use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Cost calculation for Clara\nclara_total = 15 * 15\nclara_final = clara_total - 3\n\n# Cost calculation for Sheila\nsheila_total = 15 * 25\nsheila_discount = sheila_total * Rational(15, 100)  # 15% discount\nsheila_final = sheila_total - sheila_discount\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = sheila_final - clara_final\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'Difference in cost: {difference}')\n```\n\nNow let's execute this code to find the difference in final prices paid by Clara and Sheila."
