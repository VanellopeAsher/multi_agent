You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips in his garden.

      "content": "The key idea is to figure out how many complete rows of each color Jackson can plant and then determine how these rows are interspersed.\n\nJackson has:\n\n- 36 red tulips and can fit 6 in a row.\n- 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 in a row.\n- 30 yellow tulips and can fit 5 in a row.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of rows he can plant for each color:\n\n1. Calculate the number of rows of red tulips:\n   - Since there are 36 red tulips and 6 can fit in a row, the number of rows for red tulips is \\( \\frac{36}{6} \\).\n\n2. Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips:\n   - Since there are 24 blue tulips and 8 can fit in a row, the number of rows for blue tulips is \\( \\frac{24}{8} \\).\n\n3. Calculate the number of rows of yellow tulips:\n   - Since there are 30 yellow tulips and 5 can fit in a row, the number of rows for yellow tulips is \\( \\frac{30}{5} \\).\n\nSince the rows of yellow tulips are interspersed between every row of red and blue tulips, we need to rearrange them accordingly. Let's put the calculations into Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the number of rows needed for each color\nred_rows = 36 // 6\nblue_rows = 24 // 8\nyellow_rows = 30 // 5\n\n# Since a yellow row is added between each row of red and blue\n# We will add them between red rows and between red-blue rows\n# Red rows contribute to one yellow row between them\n# Blue rows contribute to one yellow row between them with the last arrangement with red\nyellow_needed = red_rows + blue_rows + 1\n\n# Ensure we do not exceed available yellow rows\ntotal_yellow_rows = min(yellow_rows, yellow_needed)\n\n# Total rows will be red + blue + the actual yellow rows fitting in between\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows + total_yellow_rows\n\nprint(f\"Total rows of flowers: {total_rows}\")\n```\n\nLet's run this calculation to find out how many total rows of flowers Jackson will plant."
