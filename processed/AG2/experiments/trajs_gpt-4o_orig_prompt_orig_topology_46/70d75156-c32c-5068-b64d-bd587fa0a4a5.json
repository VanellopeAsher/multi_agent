Calculate the total number of oranges based on the number of boxes and the number of oranges per box.\n2. Determine how many boxes Mrs. Harrington initially gave away.\n3. Compute how many oranges are left after giving away the boxes.\n4. Calculate how many oranges Mrs. Harrington kept.\n5. Subtract the oranges kept by Mrs. Harrington from the remaining oranges to determine how many oranges were sold.\n\nWe will use Python to implement this calculation by following Case 1, since the problem can be handled directly with Python calculations.\n\n```python\n# Total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought\ntotal_boxes = 0  # This needs to be calculated based on final conditions\n\n# Each box contains 20 oranges\noranges_per_box = 20\n\n# Mrs. Harrington gave away 2 boxes each to her mom and sister\nboxes_given_away = 2 + 2  # 2 boxes to mom and 2 boxes to sister\n\n# Calculate total oranges before giving any away\ntotal_oranges_given_away = boxes_given_away * oranges_per_box\n\n# Let's say she initially bought a specific number of boxes such that she ends up keeping 1/4 of the total oranges.\n# We will assume the total such that for given conditions, we have:\n# remaining_oranges = (3/4) * total_oranges\n# remaining_oranges = total_oranges - (1/4) * total_oranges\n# remaining_oranges is what she would have after giving away which is total_oranges - total_oranges_given_away\n\n# If she keeps 1/4 of the remaining oranges\n# she_sells = remaining_oranges - she_keeps\n\n# Let's denote total_oranges as the number of oranges she initially bought (before giving away boxes)\n# therefore, total_oranges = total_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define a symbol for total number of boxes\ntotal_boxes = symbols('total_boxes', positive=True, integer=True)\n\n# Define total oranges bought in terms of boxes\ntotal_oranges = total_boxes * oranges_per_box\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem condition: total_oranges - total_oranges_given_away = (4/3) * oranges_sold\n# received_oranges = total_oranges - total_oranges_given_away\n\n# Solve how many boxes she initially bought to match the constraint of keeping 1/4\nequation = solve((1/4) * (total_oranges - total_oranges_given_away) - (total_oranges - total_oranges_given_away - (1/4) * (total_oranges - total_oranges_given_away)), total_boxes)\n\n# Let's calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold.\nboxes_initially_bought = equation[0]  # solving from the above condition\ninitial_total_oranges = boxes_initially_bought * oranges_per_box\n\n# Orange she ends after\nremaining_oranges_after_given_away = initial_total_oranges - total_oranges_given_away\n\n# Oranges she kept out of the remaining 1/4\noranges_kept = (1/4) * remaining_oranges_after_given_away\n\n# Oranges she sold\noranges_sold = remaining_oranges_after_given_away - oranges_kept\n\nprint(f\"Number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold: {oranges_sold}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run the provided Python code, you should determine how many boxes were bought initially and, finally, how many oranges were sold by following the condition given in the problem.
