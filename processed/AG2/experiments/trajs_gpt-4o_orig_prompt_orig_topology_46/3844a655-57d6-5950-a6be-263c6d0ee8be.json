  "problem": "Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $2000, regardless of how many guests attend. While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.

      "content": "To determine how many guests are needed for the costs of the two venues to be equal, we need to set up equations for the total cost of each venue and find the number of guests that makes both costs equal.\n\nThe key idea here is to express the cost for each venue as a function of the number of guests and then solve the equation that sets these two costs equal.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of Venue 1:**\n   - Venue 1 has a flat fee of $2000, plus an additional $50 per person for food.\n   - Total cost for Venue 1, \\(C_1\\), given \\(n\\) guests is:\n     \\[\n     C_1 = 2000 + 50 \\times n\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost of Venue 2:**\n   - Venue 2 charges $250 per person, including food.\n   - Total cost for Venue 2, \\(C_2\\), given \\(n\\) guests is:\n     \\[\n     C_2 = 250 \\times n\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set the Costs Equal to Each Other:**\n   - We need to find the number of guests, \\(n\\), such that \\(C_1 = C_2\\):\n     \\[\n     2000 + 50 \\times n = 250 \\times n\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(n\\):**\n\nLet's solve the equation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nn = symbols('n')\nC1 = 2000 + 50 * n\nC2 = 250 * n\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(C1, C2)\n\n# Solve for n\nn_guests = solve(equation, n)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(n_guests[0])\n```\n\nThis code sets up the equation for when both costs are equal and solves for the number of guests, \\(n\\)."
