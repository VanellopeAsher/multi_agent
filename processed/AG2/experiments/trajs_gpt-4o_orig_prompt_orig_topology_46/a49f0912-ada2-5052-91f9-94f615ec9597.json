You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "To solve this problem, I will apply reasoning and simple algebra.\n\nKey Idea:\nSince we need to find out how much time John spent sightseeing, the key is to figure out his total vacation time. From there, we can calculate the time spent on various activities given their percentages.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the time John spent on individual activities:\n   - Boating: 60 hours\n   - Swimming: \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) hours\n   - Watching shows: \\( 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\) hours\n\n2. The total time spent (600 hours watching shows) is 30% of his vacation time. Let's denote his total vacation time as \\( x \\).\n\n3. Set up the equation for the total vacation time:\n   \\[\n   0.3x = 600 \n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\n5. Calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total vacation time:\n   \\[\n   0.4x\n   \\]\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total time spent watching shows was 30% of total vacation time\nequation = Eq(0.3 * x, 600)\n\n# Solve for total vacation time\ntotal_vacation_time = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate time spent sightseeing (40% of the total vacation time)\ntime_sightseeing = 0.4 * total_vacation_time\n\n# Print the sightseeing time\nprint(time_sightseeing)\n```\n\nPlease run this code to obtain the time John spent sightseeing."
