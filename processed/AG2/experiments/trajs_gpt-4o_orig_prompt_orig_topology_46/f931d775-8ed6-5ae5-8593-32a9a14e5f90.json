  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize across different parts of his theater production:\n\n1. **Song Lines**: Sean's solo song has 54 lines.\n\n2. **First Scene Lines**: \n   - Total lines in the first scene = \\(2 \\times 54 = 108\\).\n   - Sean's lines in the first scene = \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 108 = 36\\).\n\n3. **Second Scene Lines**: \n   - Total lines in the second scene = \\(54 + 6 = 60\\).\n   - Normally, Sean would memorize four-fifths of these lines = \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = 48\\).\n   - However, due to an absent actor, Sean only needs to memorize 15 lines in this scene.\n\n4. **Total Lines Sean Memorizes**: \n   - Total = lines from the song + lines from the first scene + lines from the second scene.\n   - Total = \\(54 + 36 + 15\\).\n\nUsing Python to compute the total lines, we have:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize\nsong_lines = 54\nfirst_scene_total = 2 * song_lines\nfirst_scene_sean = Fraction(1, 3) * first_scene_total\n\nsecond_scene_total = song_lines + 6\nsecond_scene_sean = 15  # Given due to actor absence\n\ntotal_lines = song_lines + first_scene_sean + second_scene_sean\n\n# Print the output using 'Fraction' for exact arithmetic\nprint(Fraction(total_lines))\n```\n\nOnce you run the Python code above, you will find that the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \\(\\boxed{105}\\)."
