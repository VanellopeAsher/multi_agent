You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out John's running speed given that he runs a total of 60 miles a week under the described conditions.\n\nKey Idea:\nWe will calculate the total time he spends running, then use the distance (60 miles) to find his average running speed.\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance John runs in a week (already given as 60 miles).\n\n2. Calculate the total time John runs in a week:\n   - Day 1: He runs for 3 hours.\n   - Days 2 and 3: He runs half as much as on Day 1, so each of these days, he runs for 1.5 hours.\n\n   Total running time = 3 hours (Day 1) + 1.5 hours (Day 2) + 1.5 hours (Day 3).\n\n3. With the total distance and total time, we can calculate his average speed using the formula:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n   \\]\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate John's average running speed:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total distance John runs in a week, in miles\ntotal_distance = 60\n\n# Calculate total running time in hours\ntime_day1 = 3\ntime_day2 = time_day3 = time_day1 / 2\ntotal_time = time_day1 + time_day2 + time_day3\n\n# Calculate the speed\nspeed = Rational(total_distance, total_time)\nprint(f\"John's average running speed is {speed} miles per hour.\")\n```\n\nThis code should give us John's average running speed in miles per hour."
