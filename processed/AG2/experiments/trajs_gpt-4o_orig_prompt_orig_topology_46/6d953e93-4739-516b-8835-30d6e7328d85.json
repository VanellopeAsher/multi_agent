  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The income for Thursday is calculated as:  \n   \\[ \\text{Income on Thursday} = 6 \\times 60 + 4 \\times 40 \\]\n\n2. On Friday, the mechanic repaired \\( x \\) car tires. The income for Friday is:  \n   \\[ \\text{Income on Friday} = x \\times 40 \\]\n\n3. According to the problem, the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. Therefore, we can write the equation:  \n   \\[ \\text{Income on Thursday} = \\text{Income on Friday} + 40 \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation to find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Declare the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Expressions for income on Thursday and Friday\nincome_thursday = 6 * 60 + 4 * 40\nincome_friday = x * 40\n\n# Equation based on the problem statement\nequation = Eq(income_thursday, income_friday + 40)\n\n# Solve for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the value of \\( x \\). The solution represents the number of car tires repaired on Friday. Let's calculate it and box the answer."
