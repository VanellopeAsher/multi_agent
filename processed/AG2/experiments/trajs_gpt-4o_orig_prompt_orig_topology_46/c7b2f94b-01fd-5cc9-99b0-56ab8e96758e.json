  "problem": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Total apples collected by Joanne is \\( 30 + 15 + 350 = 395 \\).\n2. Total apples collected by her sister is \\( 60 + x \\).\n3. The combined total is 500: \n   \\[\n   395 + (60 + x) = 500\n   \\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define symbol for the number of apples the sister collects from the shortest trees\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem\njoanne_apples = 30 + 15 + 350\nsister_apples_from_tallest = 2 * 30  # twice as much as Joanne from tallest\ncombined_apples = 500\n\n# Setup the equation\nequation = Eq(joanne_apples + (sister_apples_from_tallest + x), combined_apples)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsister_apples_from_shortest = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate the factor by which her sister gathers more apples from shortest trees\nfactor = sister_apples_from_shortest / 15\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n\nLet me run this calculation to find the answer."
