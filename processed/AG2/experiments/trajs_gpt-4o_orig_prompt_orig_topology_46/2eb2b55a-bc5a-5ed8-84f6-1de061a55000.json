You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack.

We'll calculate backward to find the initial number of bandages.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the initial number of bandages\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the bandages remaining at the end of the first day:\nremaining_day1 = x - 38 + 50\n\n# Calculate the bandages remaining at the end of the second day:\nremaining_day2 = remaining_day1 - 28\n\n# Calculate the bandages remaining at the end of the third day:\nremaining_day3 = remaining_day2 + 100 - 25\n\n# We know that at the end of the third day we have 78 bandages:\nequation = Eq(remaining_day3, 78)\n\n# Solve for x\ninitial_bandages = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\nprint(initial_bandages)\n```\n\nThe program above will output the initial number of bandages at the beginning of the first day. Let's solve the equation step by step:\n\n1. Calculate bandages remaining at the end of the first day: \\( x - 38 + 50 \\)\n2. Calculate bandages remaining at the end of the second day: \\( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \\)\n3. Calculate bandages remaining at the end of the third day: \\(((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25 \\)\n\nReplace known value at the end of the third day (78) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nRun the Python code above to find the value of \\( x \\)."
