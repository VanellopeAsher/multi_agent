You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 10 sisters.

      "content": "**Key Idea:**\n\nWe will solve this problem step by step, as it involves both reasoning and straightforward calculations.\n\n**Steps to solve the problem:**\n\n1. Determine the age of the older brother.\n2. Calculate the total age of all siblings together.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. We know that one of the brothers is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother. We need to find the age of the older brother:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Older Brother's Age} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, let's determine the total age of all siblings. The siblings include 10 sisters and 2 brothers.\n   - Each sister is 16 years old, so the combined age for all sisters is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 16\n     \\]\n   - The age of the younger brother is 12.\n   - The age of the older brother is 24.\n\n3. Calculate the total age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Age} = (10 \\times 16) + 12 + 24\n   \\]\n\nNow let's calculate the total age using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total age of all siblings\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Number of sisters and their age\nnum_sisters = 10\nage_sister = 16\n\n# Age of the brothers\nage_younger_brother = 12\nage_older_brother = 24\n\n# Calculate total age\ntotal_age = (num_sisters * age_sister) + age_younger_brother + age_older_brother\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the total age of all siblings. Please proceed to execute and share the results."
