You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCarly wants to treat her friends.

We can do this using Python to perform the arithmetic operations.\n\nHere's how we will solve it:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the hamburgers.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the potato fries.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the fruit drinks.\n4. Add up all these costs to get the total expense.\n5. Subtract the total expense from the fifty-dollar bill to determine the change Carly gets back.\n\nLet's write a Python program to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary tools\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices and quantities\nprice_per_hamburger = 4\nnumber_of_hamburgers = 5\n\nprice_per_potato_fries = Rational(30, 100)  # 0.30 as a fraction\nnumber_of_potato_fries = 10\n\nprice_per_fruit_drink = 0  # The price isn't specified, assuming it's free\nnumber_of_fruit_drinks = 5\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = (price_per_hamburger * number_of_hamburgers +\n              price_per_potato_fries * number_of_potato_fries +\n              price_per_fruit_drink * number_of_fruit_drinks)\n\n# Amount given\namount_given = 50\n\n# Calculate change\nchange = amount_given - total_cost\n\n# Output the change\nprint(f\"The change Carly gets back is: $\", change)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find out how much change Carly gets back."
