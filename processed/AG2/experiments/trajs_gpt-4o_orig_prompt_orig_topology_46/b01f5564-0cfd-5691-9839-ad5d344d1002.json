You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much protein John consumes per week given that he eats a certain amount of mushrooms daily. This is a straightforward calculation problem that we can solve using Python code.\n\nKey Idea:\n- We need to first determine how much protein is in 300 grams of mushrooms.\n- We then multiply this daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given data\nmushroom_weight = 150  # grams per cup\nprotein_per_cup = 4    # grams of protein\n\n# John's daily mushroom consumption\ndaily_mushroom_consumption = 300  # grams\n\n# Calculate the protein per gram of mushroom\nprotein_per_gram = Rational(protein_per_cup, mushroom_weight)\n\n# Calculate John's daily protein intake\ndaily_protein_intake = protein_per_gram * daily_mushroom_consumption\n\n# Calculate the weekly protein intake\nweekly_protein_intake = daily_protein_intake * 7\n\nprint(weekly_protein_intake)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the weekly protein intake in grams expressed as a rational number."
