You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween.

Let's proceed using the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of candy.\n2. Divide the total by the number of individuals to get the amount of candy per person.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of pounds of candy each person initially has\nrobert_candy = 3\ncindy_candy = 5\naaron_candy = 4\n\n# Calculate total candy\ntotal_candy = robert_candy + cindy_candy + aaron_candy\n\n# Number of people sharing the candy\nnumber_of_people = 3\n\n# Calculate the amount of candy each person gets\ncandy_per_person = total_candy / number_of_people\n\n# Print the result in a simplified fraction using sympy\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Output the amount of candy each person gets\nprint(Rational(candy_per_person))\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and print the amount of candy each person would have if they shared equally, expressed as a fraction."

Let's continue with the reasoning:\n\nAfter calculating the total amount of candy, which is \\( 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \\) pounds, we divide this total by the number of individuals, which is 3. This gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{Candy per person} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\]\n\nThus, each person would have 4 pounds of candy. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4 \\text{ pounds}}\n\\]"
