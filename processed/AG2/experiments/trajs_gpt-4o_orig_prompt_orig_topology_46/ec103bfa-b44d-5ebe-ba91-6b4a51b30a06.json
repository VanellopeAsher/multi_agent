You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We'll start by calculating the cost of the items she bought, excluding the pizzas, and then determine how many pizzas she bought given the total cost. \n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\n- Cost of one chicken meal: $120\n- Cost of 5 packs of milk: \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\)\n- Cost of 40 apples: \\(40 \\times 1.5 = 60\\)\n- Let \\(x\\) be the number of boxes of pizza, each costing $57.\n\nGiven the total payment is $900, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ \n120 + 150 + 60 + 57x = 900 \n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\) will give us the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(120 + 5 * 30 + 40 * 1.5 + 57 * x, 900)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution, ensuring the output is in fractions/radical forms\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of pizza boxes ordered."
