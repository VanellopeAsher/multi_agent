You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

We'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Articles Written**:\n   - Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday using the information given about Monday.\n   - Determine the total number of articles written on Wednesday, given the total hours worked over the three days.\n  \n2. **Calculate the Time Spent**:\n   - Use the total hours spent to find out how the writing time was distributed across the three days.\n\n3. **Solve for Wednesday's Articles**:\n   - Finally, find out how many times more articles she wrote on Wednesday compared to Tuesday.\n\nNow, let's express this in equations and solve it with Python in case 1:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational\n\n# Let x be the number of articles written on Tuesday.\n# y be the number of articles written on Wednesday.\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Articles written:\narticles_monday = 5\narticles_tuesday = articles_monday + Rational(2, 5) * articles_monday\narticles_wednesday = y\n\n# Total hours spent (since each article takes 4 hours):\nhours_monday = articles_monday * 4\nhours_tuesday = articles_tuesday * 4\nhours_wednesday = y * 4\n\n# Total hours worked: 104 hours\neq_total_hours = Eq(hours_monday + hours_tuesday + hours_wednesday, 104)\n\n# Solve for y (the number of articles on Wednesday)\nsol = solve(eq_total_hours, y)\narticles_written_wednesday = sol[0]\n\n# Calculate how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as Tuesday\nratio_wednesday_tuesday = articles_written_wednesday / articles_tuesday\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"Articles written on Monday: {articles_monday}\")\nprint(f\"Articles written on Tuesday: {articles_tuesday}\")\nprint(f\"Articles written on Wednesday: {articles_written_wednesday}\")\nprint(f\"Ratio of articles written on Wednesday to Tuesday: {ratio_wednesday_tuesday}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this to find the solution."
