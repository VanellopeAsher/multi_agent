You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a certain grade level, two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home.

According to the problem, two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer, which means \\(\\frac{2}{3}x\\) students have a desktop.\n3. Therefore, the remaining students who do not have a desktop computer is given by \\( x - \\frac{2}{3}x = \\frac{1}{3}x \\).\n4. We know from the problem statement that 30 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, we can set up the equation \\(\\frac{1}{3}x = 30\\).\n5. Solve this equation for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's use Python and sympy to solve this equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for the number of students who do not have a desktop\nequation = Eq(x / 3, 30)\n\n# Solve the equation\ntotal_students = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_students[0])\n```\n\nLet's execute the above code to find the number of students at the grade level."
