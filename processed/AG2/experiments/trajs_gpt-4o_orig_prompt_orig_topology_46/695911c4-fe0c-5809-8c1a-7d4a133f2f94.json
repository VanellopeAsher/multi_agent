You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into parts and use Python to perform the calculations. Here's the logical plan:\n\n1. Calculate Pauline's expenses for the first 10 years when each visit costs $10.\n2. Calculate the cost of each visit after a 150% increase.\n3. Compute Pauline's expenses for the additional 3 years with the increased visit cost.\n4. Sum the expenses for all 13 years.\n\nThis problem can be directly solved with Python code (Case 1). Let's implement the solution:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for potential fraction handling, but it's mainly straightforward arithmetic\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Variables\ninitial_cost_per_visit = 10\nvisits_per_year = 3\nyears_first_period = 10\nyears_second_period = 3\n\n# Calculations\ninitial_total_cost = initial_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_first_period\n\n# The cost is increased by 150%\nincreased_cost_per_visit = initial_cost_per_visit * Rational(150, 100) + initial_cost_per_visit\n\n# Total cost after price increase\nincreased_total_cost = increased_cost_per_visit * visits_per_year * years_second_period\n\n# Total cost over 13 years\ntotal_cost = initial_total_cost + increased_total_cost\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Total cost over 13 years: ${total_cost}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits over the duration of 13 years, given the increase in the cost of a visit. The use of `Rational` ensures the percentages are handled precisely, preventing any floating-point inaccuracies. Let's see the output."
