If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to balance the total cost, including purchasing and transportation, against the revenue the trader makes from selling the bags, and equate that to the profit.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( n \\) be the number of bags the trader bought and sold.\n\n2. **Cost Calculations:**\n   - Cost of buying the bags: \\( 20n \\) dollars (since each bag costs $20).\n   - Cost of transporting the bags: \\( 2n \\) dollars (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).\n\n3. **Revenue Calculation:**\n   - Revenue from selling the bags: \\( 30n \\) dollars (since each bag is sold for $30).\n\n4. **Profit Equation:**\n   - Total profit is given by: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Total cost}\n     \\]\n   - From the problem, profit is $400: \n     \\[\n     400 = 30n - (20n + 2n)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - Simplify the profit equation: \n     \\[\n     400 = 30n - 22n\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     400 = 8n\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Setup the equation based on the profit calculation\nequation = Eq(400, 30*n - (20*n + 2*n))\n\n# Solve the equation\nnumber_of_bags = solve(equation, n)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The trader sold {number_of_bags} bags of wheat.\")\n```\n\nNow, executing this code will give us the number of bags sold.
