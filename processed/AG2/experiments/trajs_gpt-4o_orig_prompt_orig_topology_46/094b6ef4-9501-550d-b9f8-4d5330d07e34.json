You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the shark based on the information given about the remoras.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nWe are given that the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. We know the length of each remora, so we can set up an equation to solve for the shark's length.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Combined Length of the Remoras:**\n   Since each remora is 6 inches long and there are 2 remoras, their combined length is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined length of remoras} = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the Equation:**\n   Let the length of the shark be \\( x \\) inches. We know the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's length. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.1x = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   We need to solve for \\( x \\) to find the length of the shark. Let's do this using Python.\n\nNow, we can write the Python code to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the problem\nequation = Eq(0.1 * x, 12)\n\n# Solve the equation\nshark_length = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Display the solution\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find the length of the shark."
