You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we can follow Case 1 because it's a straightforward calculation that can be directly solved using Python.\n\nThe key idea is to determine the total number of crayon muffins Kate can make and then find the selling price per muffin by dividing the total earnings by the number of muffins.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of crayons: Kate received 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayons is \\(3 \\times 64\\).\n2. Calculate the number of muffins: Each muffin is made from 8 crayons, so divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the total number of muffins.\n3. Calculate the selling price per muffin: Kate made $36 by selling all the muffins, so divide the total earnings by the number of muffins to find the price per muffin.\n\nLet's write the Python code to find the solution:\n\n```python\n# Total number of crayons\ntotal_crayons = 3 * 64\n\n# Each muffin is made from 8 crayons\ncrayons_per_muffin = 8\n\n# Calculate number of muffins Kate can make\nnumber_of_muffins = total_crayons // crayons_per_muffin\n\n# Total earnings\ntotal_earnings = 36\n\n# Calculate price per muffin\nprice_per_muffin = total_earnings / number_of_muffins\n\n# Output the result\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(f\"The selling price per muffin is ${Rational(total_earnings, number_of_muffins)}\")\n```\n\nAfter running this code, the answer for the price of each muffin crayon will be displayed in fractional form. Let's determine the output.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\$1.50}\n\\] \n\nHence, each muffin crayon sells for $1.50."

Kate has a total of \\(3 \\times 64 = 192\\) crayons.\n2. Each muffin requires 8 crayons, so the total number of muffins Kate can make is \\(192 \\div 8 = 24\\).\n3. If she made $36 by selling all the muffin crayons, the price per muffin is \\(\\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, Kate sells each muffin crayon for \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) dollars or $1.50.\n\nThe correct answer in fractional form is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\\)."
