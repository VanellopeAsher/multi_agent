You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is straightforward calculation, which can be easily done using Python (Case 1).\n\nHere's the breakdown of the expenses for Patty's job:\n\n1. Service Fee: $40\n2. Labor Cost: $35 per hour\n3. Parts Cost: $60\n4. Total Hours Worked: 2.25 hours\n\nNote: Since the labor charge is for each hour or fraction thereof, we must round up the 2.25 hours to the nearest whole hour, which is 3 hours.\n\nNow, let's write a Python program to calculate the total amount billed:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total billed amount\n\n# Constants\nservice_fee = 40\nlabor_rate = 35\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# Hours worked (rounded up to the nearest whole hour)\nhours_worked = 2.25\nrounded_hours = -(-hours_worked // 1)  # Equivalent to math.ceil(2.25)\n\n# Calculate the labor cost\nlabor_cost = rounded_hours * labor_rate\n\n# Total amount billed\ntotal_billed = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_billed)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, the result will be printed. Let's calculate it manually here:\n\n- For 2.25 hours, we round up to 3 hours.\n- Labor Cost: \\(35 \\times 3 = 105\\)\n- Total Billed: \\(40 + 105 + 60 = 205\\)\n\nThus, the total amount billed by Patty is \\(\\boxed{205}\\)."
