You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Each pack contains 5 canvas bags and costs $4.\n2. Each painted canvas bag is sold for $8.\n3. Tara's profit from selling the bags amounts to $160.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Calculate the total revenue Tara made from selling the bags.\n- Calculate the cost for the number of packs she bought.\n- Use these variables to set up an equation based on the given profit.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of packs Tara bought.\n\nThe total number of bags is \\( 5x \\).\nThe total cost for buying the packs is \\( 4x \\) dollars.\nThe revenue from selling all bags is \\( 8 \\times 5x = 40x \\) dollars.\n\nThe profit is given by the difference between the revenue and the cost:\n\n\\[\n40x - 4x = 160\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python to find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(40*x - 4*x, 160)\n\n# Solve the equation\npacks_bought = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the answer\nprint(packs_bought)\n```\n\nThis should give us the number of packs Tara bought."

We have established an incorrect solution if any fraction occurs since packs purchased should logically be a whole number. Let's reassess the steps:\n\n1. Since 40x - 4x = 160 was meant to balance cost against revenue, the split may have been wrong.\n   \nLet's fix the calculation manually:\n\n\\[ 40x - 4x = 160 \\]\n\n\\[ 36x = 160 \\]\n\nFrom here received \\( x = \\frac{40}{9} \\), this cannot be integral.
