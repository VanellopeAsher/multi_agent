The total cost for the Karate classes is $60, and there are 10 total classes. We need to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe need to determine how many Karate classes Manny can attend such that each class costs \\( \\leq $10 \\). If he misses some classes, then the equation to consider is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{cost per class} = \\frac{60}{\\text{attended classes}} \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nThe number of classes attended can be calculated from the total classes minus the missed classes. Let's denote the number of classes attended by \\( x \\). The inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this inequality:\n\n\\[\n60 \\leq 10x \\implies x \\geq 6\n\\]\n\nThis means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost \\( \\leq $10 \\) per class. Since there are 10 classes in total, he can miss:\n\n\\[\n10 - 6 = 4 \\text{ classes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{4}\\)\n\nWe do not need additional code to verify this conclusion, as it is a straightforward calculation. Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes."
