You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 100 miles a week.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine John's running speed in terms of distance divided by time. We'll start by calculating the total time John spends running over the week based on the given conditions and compare it to the total distance (100 miles).\n\n**Key Idea**: Use Python to calculate the total running time John spends in a week and his average speed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. John runs 100 miles a week.\n2. He runs for 10 hours on the first day.\n3. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day (i.e., 5 hours each).\n4. Calculate the total time spent running:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time (hours)} = 10 + 2 \\times 5 = 20\n   \\]\n5. John's speed is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{20 \\text{ hours}}\n   \\]\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, Symbol, Eq, solve\n\n# Total distance and time\ntotal_distance = 100  # miles\nhours_first_day = 10\nhours_other_days = 0.5 * hours_first_day * 2  # 5 each for 2 days\ntotal_time = hours_first_day + hours_other_days\n\n# Calculate speed\nspeed = Rational(total_distance, total_time)\nprint(speed)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us John's average speed in miles per hour."
