You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small t-shirts Octavia used to make the quilt. We'll do this by setting up an equation that models the total area of the quilt using the areas provided for each type of t-shirt and the number of medium and large t-shirts used.\n\nThe key idea here is to use simple algebra to solve for the unknown number of small t-shirts.\n\nLet's go through the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Define the variables:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of small t-shirts.\n   - A small t-shirt covers 3 square feet, a medium t-shirt covers 4 square feet, and a large t-shirt covers 6 square feet.\n\n2. Set up the equation based on the given information:\n   - Total area from small t-shirts: \\( 3x \\) square feet.\n   - Total area from medium t-shirts: \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\) square feet.\n   - Total area from large t-shirts: \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\) square feet.\n   - The total area of the quilt: \\( 101 \\) square feet.\n\n3. Formulate the equation:\n   \\[\n   3x + 32 + 36 = 101\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( x \\), the number of small t-shirts.\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(3*x + 32 + 36, 101)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f\"The number of small t-shirts used is: {solution[0]}\")\n```\n\nThis code will solve for \\( x \\) and provide the number of small t-shirts used. Run this code to get the numerical result."
