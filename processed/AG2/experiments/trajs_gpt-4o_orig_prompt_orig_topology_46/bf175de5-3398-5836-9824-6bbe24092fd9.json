You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGiven that a single individual can complete painting half of a house in a span of 5 days, how many hours will it take for a team of 5 individuals to paint an entire house?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours it will take for 5 individuals to paint an entire house, given the rate at which a single individual works. First, let's establish the work rate of one individual and then calculate the combined work rate for all 5 individuals.\n\nKey Idea: We can calculate the amount of work done by one person and then scale it up to find out how long it will take for the team of 5 people to complete the task.\n\n### Solution\n\n1. **Determine the work rate of one individual:**\n   - One individual can paint half a house in 5 days.\n   - Therefore, one individual can paint 1/10 of a house per day (since \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ house} / 5 \\text{ days} = \\frac{1}{10} \\text{ house per day}\\)).\n\n2. **Calculate the combined work rate for 5 individuals:**\n   - Since work rate is additive when individuals work in parallel, 5 individuals can paint 5 times as much as a single individual in the same amount of time.\n   - Thus, 5 individuals can paint \\((5 \\times \\frac{1}{10}) \\text{ houses per day} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ house per day}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken to paint an entire house:**\n   - To paint a whole house, which is \\(1\\) house, the time taken is the reciprocal of the work rate for the team.\n   - Therefore, the time it will take is \\(\\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ house per day}} = 2 \\text{ days}\\).\n\n4. **Convert days into hours:**\n   - Typically, a working day can be assumed to be 8 hours long.\n   - Therefore, \\(2 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ hours per day} = 16 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nNow let's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of hours to paint an entire house by 5 individuals.\nindividual_rate = 1/10  # house per day for one individual\nteam_rate = 5 * individual_rate  # house per day for the team of 5 individuals\ntime_in_days = 1 / team_rate  # days to paint one house\nhours_per_day = 8  # assuming a working day is 8 hours\ntime_in_hours = time_in_days * hours_per_day\n\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Printing the result in fraction form\nprint(Rational(time_in_hours))\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the time in hours. The answer should be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
