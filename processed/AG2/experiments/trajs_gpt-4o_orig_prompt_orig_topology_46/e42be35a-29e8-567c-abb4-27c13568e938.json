You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

She received an additional \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies.\n3. Her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which equates to \\( 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\) brownies.\n4. During the party, \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\) dozen brownies were eaten. This is \\( 1.5 \\times 12 = 18\\) brownies.\n\nWe need to calculate the total brownies Greta had initially and then subtract the number of brownies eaten to find how many she had left.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the quantities\nhomemade_brownies = 12\noffice_brownies = 6\nfriend_brownies = 4 * 12\neaten_brownies = int(1.5 * 12)\n\n# Calculate the total brownies Greta had\ntotal_brownies = homemade_brownies + office_brownies + friend_brownies\n\n# Calculate the brownies left after the party\nleftover_brownies = total_brownies - eaten_brownies\n\n# Output the result\nprint(leftover_brownies)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the number of individual brownies Greta has left over from the entire day."
