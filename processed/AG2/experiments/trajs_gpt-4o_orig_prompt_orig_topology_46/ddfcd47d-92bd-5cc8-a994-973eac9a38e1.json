You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nRayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia.

Kassidy, who has \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of Aurelia's money, has $100. This matches since \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = 100\\).\n3. Rayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy, resulting in $170. This is accurate since \\(100 + 70 = 170\\).\n4. The total amount of money they collectively have is $420, calculated as \\(150 + 100 + 170 = 420\\).\n5. When they share this money equally, each receives $140, calculated as \\(\\frac{420}{3} = 140\\).\n\nThus, each person would have received: \\(\\boxed{140}\\) dollars.\nThis confirms that both the calculations and logic align with your results."
