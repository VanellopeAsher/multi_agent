  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

Calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer buys.\n2. Sum these weights to get the total weight of all the feed.\n3. Divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to determine the number of trips needed, rounding up since partial trips still count as full trips.\n\nWe'll use Python to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Weights and quantities of each feed type\nsugar_cubes_weight = 20 * 10    # 20 boxes of 10 pounds each\ncarrots_weight = 40 * 120      # 40 bags of 120 pounds each\nhay_weight = 420 * 750         # 420 bales of 750 pounds each\noats_weight = 200 * 650        # 200 sacks of 650 pounds each\n\n# Total weight of all feed\ntotal_feed_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight\n\n# Truck capacity\ntruck_capacity = 22500\n\n# Number of trips needed\ntrips_needed = math.ceil(total_feed_weight / truck_capacity)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Total feed weight: {total_feed_weight} pounds\")\nprint(f\"Number of trips needed: {trips_needed}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the exact number of trips needed."
