You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

Then, we will subtract the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows to find the time spent sightseeing. This is a calculation problem, so it's suitable for Python.\n\nLet's break it down and solve it with Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let T be the total time John spent on vacation\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# Given variables\nboating_time = 6  # hours\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2  # half of boating time\nshow_time_per_show = 2  # hours\nnumber_of_shows = 3\n\n# Total time spent on shows\nshows_time = show_time_per_show * number_of_shows\n\n# According to the problem, this was 30% of his vacation time\npercentage_of_shows = 0.3\nequation = Eq(shows_time, percentage_of_shows * T)\n\n# Solve the equation for T\ntotal_vacation_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# Calculate the total time spent on known activities\nknown_activities_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time\n\n# Time spent sightseeing\nsightseeing_time = total_vacation_time - known_activities_time\n\n# Output the time spent sightseeing\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give the value of sightseeing time, which we can then box as the final answer."
