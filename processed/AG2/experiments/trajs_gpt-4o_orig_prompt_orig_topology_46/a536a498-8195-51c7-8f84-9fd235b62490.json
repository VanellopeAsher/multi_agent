You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of people Courtney reported at the concert, knowing that she overstated the number by 20%.\n\nKey Idea: We can use a simple mathematical calculation to solve this problem (Case 1).\n\nHere's how to solve it:\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the audience size Courtney reported.\n2. According to Kelly, Courtney overstated the attendance by 20%, which means the correct audience size (40 people) is 80% of what Courtney reported.\n3. Therefore, the equation is: \n   \\[\n   0.8x = 40\n   \\]\n\nLet's use Python and SymPy to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(0.8 * x, 40)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the audience size Courtney reported."
