You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are three trees in Eddy's backyard.

We'll first determine the heights of the first two trees, use that information to find the combined height of these trees, and then compute the tallest tree's height.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the height of the second tree by adding 50 feet to the shortest tree's height.\n2. Combine the heights of the shortest and the second tree.\n3. Determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the two other trees.\n4. Output the height of the tallest tree using fractions if necessary, though in this case an integer result is expected.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the height of the tallest tree:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Heights of the trees\nshortest_tree = 60\nsecond_tree = shortest_tree + 50\ncombined_height = shortest_tree + second_tree\n\n# Height of the tallest tree\ntallest_tree_height = 2 * combined_height\n\n# Print the result\nprint(Rational(tallest_tree_height))\n```\n\nThis will output the height of the tallest tree using integer values since no radical or fractional form is necessary in this case."

Therefore, the height of the second tree is:\n   \\[\n   60 + 50 = 110 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:\n   \\[\n   60 + 110 = 170 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n4.
