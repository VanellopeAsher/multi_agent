  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses.

We'll go with Case 1 since this problem involves calculations that can be done directly using Python.\n\nHere's an outline of the steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of clients.\n2. Calculate the total weekly expenses in terms of the cost of bleach and cloths per client.\n3. Use the given information about weekly profit and income to solve for the unknown cost of a pack of cloths.\n\nLet's translate these steps into Python code:\n\n```python\n# Import the sympy package\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx = symbols('x')  # The cost of each pack of cloths\n\n# Given values\ncurrent_clients = 3\npotential_clients = 5\ntotal_clients = current_clients + potential_clients\n\ncost_of_bleach = 2\nbottles_per_client = 2\nweekly_income = 92\nweekly_profit = 20\n\n# Calculate total cost of bleach\ntotal_cost_bleach = total_clients * bottles_per_client * cost_of_bleach\n\n# Define the equation based on profit = income - expenses\nequation = Eq(weekly_profit, weekly_income - (total_cost_bleach + total_clients * x))\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the resulting cost of a pack of cloths\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code calculates the cost of each pack of cloths based on the provided information."
