You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand that Marty is cutting a long ribbon into smaller pieces in two phases.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nWe are going to solve this problem using mathematical calculations. We'll first find out the length of each part after the first cut, then find out the length of each piece after the second cut. Since these calculations are straightforward and can be directly handled by Python, we'll use Case 1.\n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total length of the ribbon in millimeters\ntotal_length = 10000\n\n# Number of parts the ribbon is cut into in the first round\nfirst_cut_parts = 40\n\n# Number of parts each first cut part is divided into\nsecond_cut_parts = 50\n\n# Calculate the length of each piece after the first cut\nlength_after_first_cut = Rational(total_length, first_cut_parts)\n\n# Calculate the length of each piece after the second cut\nfinal_length_each_piece = Rational(length_after_first_cut, second_cut_parts)\n\n# Print the length of each final piece in fractional form\nprint(final_length_each_piece)\n```\n\nLet's run this code, and it will give you the length of each final piece in fraction/radical form."

      "content": "Great! The result from running the code indicates that each final piece of ribbon is 5 millimeters long.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the solution:\n1. The total ribbon length is 10,000 millimeters.\n2. Marty first cuts the ribbon into 40 equal parts, so each part is \\(\\frac{10000}{40} = 250\\) millimeters long.\n3. Each of these 40 parts is then divided into 50 equal lengths, so each final piece is \\(\\frac{250}{50} = 5\\) millimeters long.\n\nTherefore, the length of each final cut is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) millimeters."
