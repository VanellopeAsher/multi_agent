That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGeorge needs to pay for dental work.

Calculate the total cost for the implants, including the additional cost for the porcelain crown.\n2. Subtract the deposit he has already put down from the total cost.\n3. Calculate the number of hours George needs to work based on his hourly wage to cover the remaining cost.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Symbol, solve, Rational\n\n# Define the costs\nbase_price_per_implant = Rational(2000.5)\nadditional_cost_for_crown = Rational(500.5)\ndeposit = Rational(600)\nhourly_wage = Rational(15.3)\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the dental work\ntotal_cost = 2 * base_price_per_implant + additional_cost_for_crown\n\n# Calculate the remaining cost after the deposit\nremaining_cost = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Define the number of hours George needs to work\nhours = Symbol('hours')\n\n# Solve for hours needed to pay for the remaining cost\nhours_needed = solve(hours * hourly_wage - remaining_cost, hours)\n\nprint(hours_needed[0])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine how many hours George needs to work.\n\n(The solution will use `Rational` to maintain fractions rather than convert to decimals.)"
