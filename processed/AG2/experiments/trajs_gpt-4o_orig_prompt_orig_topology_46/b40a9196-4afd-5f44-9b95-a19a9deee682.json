You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to apply a 10% tax to items that are not food, calculate the total cost including tax, and output the result using fractions or fixed numbers instead of decimals. In this case, food items are milk and eggs. Non-food items, to which we apply the tax, include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. Let's write a Python program to perform these calculations.\n\nKey Idea:\n1. Identify the items that are taxed and those that are not.\n2. Calculate the total cost of taxed items with the tax included.\n3. Sum the costs of non-taxed and taxed-with-tax items for the total cost.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Prices of the items\nmilk_cost = 2\neggs_cost = 3\nlight_bulbs_cost = 3\ncups_cost = 3\nroach_traps_cost = 4\n\n# Tax rate as a fraction\ntax_rate = Rational(10, 100)  # 10%\n\n# Items not taxed (food)\nfood_items_total = milk_cost + eggs_cost\n\n# Items taxed (non-food)\nnon_food_items_total = light_bulbs_cost + cups_cost + roach_traps_cost\n\n# Calculate the tax\ntax_on_non_food_items = non_food_items_total * tax_rate\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = food_items_total + non_food_items_total + tax_on_non_food_items\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total cost including the tax in a fraction form."
