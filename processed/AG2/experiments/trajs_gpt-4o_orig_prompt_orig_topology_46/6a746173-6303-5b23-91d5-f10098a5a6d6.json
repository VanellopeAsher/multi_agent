You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from the neighbors and the online fund, then determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute based on that total. \n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer contributes.** \n   - Walter collects $300 from his neighbors.\n   - Walter collects $1200 from the online fund.\n   - In total, this amount is \\(300 + 1200\\).\n\n2. **Determine the lawyer's contribution.**\n   - The lawyer offers to donate three times the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer's contribution.\n   - Additionally, Walter's friend gives him $120, but this amount doesn't affect the lawyer's primary offer.\n\n3. **Calculate the lawyer's total contribution using the formula:**\n   - Lawyer's contribution = 3 times Walter's total collection (excluding the lawyer).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the amounts collected\nneighbors = 300\nonline_fund = 1200\nfriend_contribution = 120\n\n# Calculate the total collected by Walter before the lawyer contributes\ntotal_before_lawyer = neighbors + online_fund + friend_contribution\n\n# Calculate the lawyer's contribution\nlawyer_contribution = 3 * (neighbors + online_fund)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(lawyer_contribution)\n```\n\nNow, let's evaluate the result based on the setup:\n\n- Total collected from neighbors and online fund = $1500\n- Lawyer's contribution = \\(3 \\times 1500 = 4500\\)\n\nThus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \\(\\boxed{4500}\\) dollars."

Let's go over the correct calculation:\n\nThe friend’s contribution of $120 does not affect the lawyer’s contribution calculation, as it states \"until his friend gives him $120 as well,\" suggesting it's separate.\n\nLet's recalculate the lawyer's contribution based solely on the total collected from the neighbors and the online fund:\n\n1. **Total amount collected before the lawyer contributes** is:\n   - From neighbors: $300\n   - From the online fund: $1200\n\n   So, the total amount collected: \\(300 + 1200 = 1500\\).\n\n2. **Lawyer's contribution**:\n   - The lawyer offers to donate three times what everyone else donates, not including the friend’s contribution.\n   - Thus, Lawyer's contribution = \\(3 \\times (300 + 1200) = 3 \\times 1500 = 4500\\).\n\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute \\(\\boxed{4500}\\) dollars."
