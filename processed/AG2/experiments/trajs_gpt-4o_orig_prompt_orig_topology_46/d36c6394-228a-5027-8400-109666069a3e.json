You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We'll use straightforward arithmetic operations to find the number of passengers still on the bus after the second stop.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1**: Calculate the number of passengers after the first stop:\n- Initial passengers on the bus: 48\n- Passengers who get off at the first stop: 8\n- Passengers who get on the bus at the first stop = 5 times the number who got off: \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)\n- Passengers who decide to get off again before departure: 2\n\n**Result after first stop**: \n\\[ \\text{Passengers after first stop} = 48 - 8 + 40 - 2 \\]\n\n**Step 2**: Calculate the number of passengers after the second stop:\n- Passengers who get off at the second stop: 21\n- Passengers who get on the bus, being 3 times fewer than those who got off: \\( \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\)\n\n**Result after second stop**:\n\\[ \\text{Passengers after second stop} = (\\text{Passengers after first stop}) - 21 + 7 \\]\n\nLet's compute these results.\n\n```python\n# Initial number of passengers\ninitial_passengers = 48\n\n# First stop\noff_first_stop = 8\non_first_stop = 5 * off_first_stop\noff_before_departure = 2\n\n# Passengers after the first stop\npassengers_after_first_stop = initial_passengers - off_first_stop + on_first_stop - off_before_departure\n\n# Second stop\noff_second_stop = 21\non_second_stop = off_second_stop // 3\n\n# Passengers after the second stop\npassengers_after_second_stop = passengers_after_first_stop - off_second_stop + on_second_stop\n\n# Output the result\nprint(passengers_after_second_stop)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it computes the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop. The result will be displayed in the console."
