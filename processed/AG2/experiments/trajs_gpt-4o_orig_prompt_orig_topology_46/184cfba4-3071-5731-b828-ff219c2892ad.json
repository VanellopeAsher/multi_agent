You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will start by establishing the relationships between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold and the total sales revenue. We need to find out how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nWe can set up equations based on the given data and then solve them using Python.\n\n### Step-by-step Process:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold, and let \\( y \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n\n2. **Establish Relationships:**\n\n   - Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Therefore, if each small stuffed animal costs $40, each large stuffed animal costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\).\n\n   - She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, giving us the equation:\n     \\[\n     x = 2y\n     \\]\n\n   - The total revenue from the sales is $1200. Thus, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     40x + 120y = 1200\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equations:**\n\n   Substitute the first equation into the second:\n   \\[\n   40(2y) + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n### Python Code:\n\nHere, we'll use the `sympy` library to solve the equations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define variables\nx, y = symbols('x y', integer=True)\n\n# Define equations\nequation1 = Eq(x, 2*y)\nequation2 = Eq(40*x + 120*y, 1200)\n\n# Solve equations\nsolutions = solve((equation1, equation2), (x, y))\n\n# Extract number of small stuffed animals sold\nnumber_of_small_stuffed_animals = solutions[x]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_small_stuffed_animals)\n```\n\nThis code will yield the number of small stuffed animals she sold.\n\nLet's execute the code to find the value for \\( x \\)."
