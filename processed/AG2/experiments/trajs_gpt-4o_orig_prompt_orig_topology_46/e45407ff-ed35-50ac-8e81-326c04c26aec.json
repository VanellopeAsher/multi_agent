You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

Determine the cost per bottle of scotch.\n2. Calculate the number of bottles of cognac and their cost per bottle.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the cognac.\n4. Calculate the total amount spent on both scotch and cognac.\n\nWe can directly implement this in Python (Case 1). Let's write a program incorporating this logic.\n\n```python\n# Import the fractions module to handle fractions easily.\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Determine the cost per bottle of scotch\ntotal_cost_scotch = 600  # total cost of scotch\nnum_bottles_scotch = 10  # number of bottles of scotch\ncost_per_bottle_scotch = total_cost_scotch / num_bottles_scotch\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of bottles of cognac and their cost per bottle\nnum_bottles_cognac = num_bottles_scotch * 2  # twice as many bottles of cognac\ncost_per_bottle_cognac = cost_per_bottle_scotch * 1.5  # 50% more per bottle\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cognac\ntotal_cost_cognac = num_bottles_cognac * cost_per_bottle_cognac\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent on everything\ntotal_cost = total_cost_scotch + total_cost_cognac\n\n# Output the total cost in a clear format\n# Using the Fraction to keep fractions instead of decimals\nprint(\"Total amount spent on everything:\", Fraction(total_cost).limit_denominator())\n```\n\nRunning this code will determine and print the total amount spent using fractions/radicals instead of decimals.
