You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day.

Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week from the daycare.\n2. Subtract his expenses from his total earnings.\n\nWe can assume that \"an entire week\" refers to a typical 5-day work week. Here's how we can use Python to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total earnings for the week\ndaily_wage = 30\ndays_worked = 5\ntotal_earnings = daily_wage * days_worked\n\n# Calculate the total expenses\nexpenses = 100\n\n# Calculate the final amount left\nmoney_left = total_earnings - expenses\n\n# Output the result\nprint(money_left)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the amount of money Gerald has left in dollars after subtracting his expenses."
