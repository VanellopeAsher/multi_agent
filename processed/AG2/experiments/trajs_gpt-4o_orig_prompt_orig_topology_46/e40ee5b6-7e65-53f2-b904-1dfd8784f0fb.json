You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon.

Let's break the problem down:\n\n1. **Price Determination:**\n   - We are given that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5.\n   - We also know that the price of a one-gallon jar is $2 higher than a half-gallon jar.\n   - Therefore, we can find the price of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the price of a one-gallon jar.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost:**\n   - Once we have the prices determined, we calculate the cost for 10 one-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.\n\nLet's proceed to write code to calculate the total expenditure using the given information.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the prices of the jars\nprice_one_gallon = 5  # dollars\nprice_half_gallon = price_one_gallon - 2  # dollars\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = (10 * price_one_gallon) + (16 * price_half_gallon)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will provide us with the total sum of money Cecelia expended."
