You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.

      "content": "To find out how much the camera costs, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total money Jayden has after combining the $70 he earned from selling pictures and the half of Ava's $90 allowance she gave him.\n2. Determine the total amount Jayden had after receiving help from Ava.\n3. Use the information that Jayden still needs $85 more to buy the camera to find the total cost of the camera.\n\nLet's break it down using Python code with the 'sympy' package, which allows us to work with exact fractions but is not strictly necessary for this integer-based problem. However, I'll adhere to using the required features and formats.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\ncamera_cost = symbols('camera_cost')\n\n# Calculate the money Jayden currently has\nmoney_from_pictures = 70\nava_allowance = 90\nmoney_from_ava = ava_allowance / 2\n\ntotal_money_jayden_has = money_from_pictures + money_from_ava\n\n# Since Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera, we set up the equation\nequation = Eq(total_money_jayden_has + 85, camera_cost)\n\n# Solve the equation for the camera cost\ncamera_cost_value = solve(equation, camera_cost)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(camera_cost_value)\n```\n\nThe code solves for the camera cost and uses symbolic computation to perform the basic arithmetic. Let's see what it computes."
