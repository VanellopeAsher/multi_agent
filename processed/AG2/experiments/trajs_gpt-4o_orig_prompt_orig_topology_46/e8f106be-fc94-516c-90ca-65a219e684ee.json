His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames is planning a birthday party and wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nWe do not need to consider the tree in the middle because James does not plan to hang streamers on the tree. The presence of the tree does not affect the calculation of the perimeter of the fence.\n\nLet's calculate the perimeter using Python.\n\n```python\n# Importing sympy for symbolic computation, but it's not strictly necessary for this calculation.\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the dimensions of the rectangle\nlength = 20\nwidth = 15\n\n# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Output the perimeter\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the total amount of crepe paper James needs to buy for his fence."
