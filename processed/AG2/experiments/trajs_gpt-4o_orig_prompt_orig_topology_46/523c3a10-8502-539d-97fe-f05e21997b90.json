You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery packet of graham crackers can be used to create the base for 8 big smores.

Calculate the total number of smores needed by the children and adults.\n2. Calculate the total number of packets needed.\n3. Calculate the number of boxes needed based on the number of packets per box.\n\nLet's implement this in the following Python program:\n\n```python\nfrom math import ceil\n\n# Total number of smores needed\nsmores_needed_children = 9 * 2  # 9 children each needing 2 smores\nsmores_needed_adults = 6 * 1    # 6 adults each needing 1 smore\ntotal_smores_needed = smores_needed_children + smores_needed_adults\n\n# Each packet can make 8 smores\nsmores_per_packet = 8\n\n# Calculate total packets needed\npackets_needed = ceil(total_smores_needed / smores_per_packet)\n\n# Each box contains 3 packets\npackets_per_box = 3\n\n# Calculate the number of boxes needed\nboxes_needed = ceil(packets_needed / packets_per_box)\n\nprint(boxes_needed)\n```\n\nWhen you run the above code, it will calculate the number of boxes of graham crackers required to meet the demand for smores."
