You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine Mark's initial weight before he fell ill, based on the changes in his weight over time described in the problem. Here's how we can do it step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight loss during the 3 months when Mark was unwell.\n2. Calculate the total weight gain during the 2 months of recovery.\n3. Use Mark's final weight to find his initial weight before he fell ill.\n\nLet's break down the steps with simple calculations:\n\n- Total weight loss over the 3 months when unwell: \\(3 \\times 10\\) pounds per month.\n- Total weight regained during recovery: \\(2 \\times 5\\) pounds per month.\n- Let \\(x\\) be Mark's initial weight. The equation for his final weight after recovery can be written as:\n  \\[\n  x - (3 \\times 10) + (2 \\times 5) = 70\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for \\(x\\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(x - (3 * 10) + (2 * 5), 70)\n\n# Solve for x\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nLet's run this program to find Mark's initial weight."
