You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs the friends found given the information. This is a straightforward problem (Case 1) where we can directly calculate the number of eggs found by the friends using Python. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. Let's say the total number of eggs is \\( x \\).\n2. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found \\( 30 + 30 = 60 \\) eggs.\n3. All the eggs except 10 were found by their friends, meaning \\( x - 60 \\) eggs were found by the friends.\n4. Therefore, \\( x - 60 - 10 \\) gives us the number of eggs found by the friends, which simplifies to \\( x - 70 \\).\n\nLet's calculate it using the given conditions:\n\n```python\n# Total number of eggs found by the Smith twins\nsmith_twins_eggs = 30 + 30\n\n# Total number of eggs not found\nunfound_eggs = 10\n\n# Hence, the eggs found by the friends\nfriends_found_eggs = smith_twins_eggs - unfound_eggs\n\nprint(friends_found_eggs)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate the number of eggs found by the friends, considering the conditions given in the problem. The calculation of this Python code will directly provide the answer."
