You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTerry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, nine burger platters for $11.5 each, and half of 40 sodas for $1.50 each.

We can directly use Python to perform these calculations, so we will follow Case 1.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Calculate the total income from milkshakes.\n2. Calculate the total income from burger platters.\n3. Calculate the total income from sodas.\n4. Sum all these amounts to get the total earnings.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate income from milkshakes\nmilkshakes_sold = 6\nmilkshake_price = Rational('5.50')\ntotal_milkshake_income = milkshakes_sold * milkshake_price\n\n# Calculate income from burger platters\nburger_platters_sold = 9\nburger_platter_price = Rational('11.5')\ntotal_burger_platter_income = burger_platters_sold * burger_platter_price\n\n# Calculate income from sodas\nsodas_sold = Rational('40') / 2\nsoda_price = Rational('1.50')\ntotal_soda_income = sodas_sold * soda_price\n\n# Calculate total income\ntotal_income = total_milkshake_income + total_burger_platter_income + total_soda_income\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_income)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the answer in a fraction form or simplified rational number.
