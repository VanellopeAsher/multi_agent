Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Miss Maria has, how many cards she keeps, and then how many are given to her students. Finally, we can calculate how many students there are by dividing the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student received.\n\nKey steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball and baseball cards.\n2. Subtract the number of cards she keeps for herself.\n3. Determine how many students there are by dividing the remaining cards by the number given to each student.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Total number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n\n# Total number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n\n# Total number of cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards\n\n# Number of cards Miss Maria keeps\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Number of cards given to students\ncards_for_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Number of cards each student receives\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Number of students\nnumber_of_students = cards_for_students // cards_per_student\n\nprint(number_of_students)\n```\n\nLet's run the code to find the number of students."
