  "problem": "Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

We will determine how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold each day, and then calculate the total earnings.\n\n### Key Idea:\nThe problem can be solved directly with Python by calculating the sales for each day and summing the total earnings from gingerbread and apple pie.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n1. Determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold each day:\n   - Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread, \\(x - 4\\) boxes of apple pie.\n   - Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread (10 + 5), 15 boxes of apple pie.\n   - Monday: 2 boxes of gingerbread, 4 boxes of apple pie.\n\n2. Calculate the earnings for each day and sum them up to get the total earnings.\n\nLet's break down the calculations with Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost for each box\ncost_gingerbread = 6\ncost_apple_pie = 15\n\n# Saturday sales\ngingerbread_saturday = 10\n# Let the number of apple pies on Saturday be 's'\n# Then number of apple pies on Sunday would be '15', since we are given that on Sunday, they sold 15.\n\n# Sunday sales\ngingerbread_sunday = gingerbread_saturday + 5\napple_pie_sunday = 15\n\n# Monday sales\ngingerbread_monday = 2\napple_pie_monday = 4\n\n# Calculate earnings\nearnings_saturday = gingerbread_saturday * cost_gingerbread + (apple_pie_sunday - 4) * cost_apple_pie\nearnings_sunday = gingerbread_sunday * cost_gingerbread + apple_pie_sunday * cost_apple_pie\nearnings_monday = gingerbread_monday * cost_gingerbread + apple_pie_monday * cost_apple_pie\n\n# Total earnings over the three days\ntotal_earnings = earnings_saturday + earnings_sunday + earnings_monday\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate Sunny's total earnings for the three days. Let's solve and box the result received."
