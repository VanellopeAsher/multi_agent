You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

This can be done easily with Python.\n\nKey idea: Calculate the total monthly payment by increasing each minimum payment by 50%, then multiply by 12 to get the annual payment.\n\nHere's the Python code following the described approach:\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary package\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the minimum payments\nstudent_loan_min = 3000\ncredit_card_min = 2000\nmortgage_min = 5000\n\n# Calculate payments with 50% more than the minimum\nstudent_loan_payment = student_loan_min * Rational(3, 2)\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min * Rational(3, 2)\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min * Rational(3, 2)\n\n# Calculate total monthly payment\nmonthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate annual payment\nannual_payment = monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result\nprint(annual_payment)\n```\n\nRun this code to obtain Jessica's total payments for a year."
