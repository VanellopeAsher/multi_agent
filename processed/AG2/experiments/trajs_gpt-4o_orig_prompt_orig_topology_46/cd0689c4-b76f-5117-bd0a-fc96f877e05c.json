You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon we can allocate per present. We need to first calculate the total number of presents and then divide the total ribbon length (144 inches) by this number to find the amount of ribbon per present.\n\nHere's how we can solve it:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of presents**: Add the number of presents for family members, buddies, and educators.\n\n2. **Calculate the length of ribbon per present**: Divide the total ribbon length by the total number of presents.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for potential simplifications\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total presents for family members, buddies, and educators\nfamily_presents = 6\nbuddies_presents = 4\neducators_presents = 2\n\n# Total number of presents\ntotal_presents = family_presents + buddies_presents + educators_presents\n\n# Total length of ribbon available\ntotal_ribbon_length = 144\n\n# Length of ribbon allocated for each present\nribbon_per_present = Rational(total_ribbon_length, total_presents)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The length of ribbon allocated for each present is {ribbon_per_present} inches.\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total number of presents and then divides the total length of ribbon by this number to find the length of ribbon per present. We use `Rational` from `sympy` to ensure the result is in fractional form. Let's run this.\n\nThe solution in the box is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{144}{12} = 12 \\text{ inches per present}}\n\\]"
