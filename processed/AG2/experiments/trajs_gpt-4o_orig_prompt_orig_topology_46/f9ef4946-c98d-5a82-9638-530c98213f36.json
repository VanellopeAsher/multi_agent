  "problem": "Frankie watches TV every evening after he finishes his homework. On Mondays and Tuesdays, he watches an hour-long episode of his favorite show every night. On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he had to stay up late over the weekend, so he watched two one-hour episodes. How many hours did he watch TV in total?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to calculate the total number of hours Frankie spent watching TV each day and then sum these amounts for the entire week.\n\nWe can approach this problem with Case 1: solve it with Python code directly. We will calculate the total by explicitly adding up the amounts for each day.\n\nLet's write a program to calculate the total number of hours:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the time spent watching TV each day\nmonday_hours = 1  # 1 hour\ntuesday_hours = 1  # 1 hour\nwednesday_hours = 3 * Rational(30, 60)  # 3 episodes of 30 minutes each\nthursday_hours = 1 + Rational(30, 60)  # 1 hour + 30 minutes\nfriday_hours = 2 * 1  # 2 one-hour episodes\n\n# Calculate the total hours watched\ntotal_hours = monday_hours + tuesday_hours + wednesday_hours + thursday_hours + friday_hours\n\n# Print the result in fractional form\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nThis program calculates the total hours Frankie watched TV from Monday to Friday based on the described schedule. It utilizes the `Rational` class from `sympy` to ensure proper handling of fractions."
