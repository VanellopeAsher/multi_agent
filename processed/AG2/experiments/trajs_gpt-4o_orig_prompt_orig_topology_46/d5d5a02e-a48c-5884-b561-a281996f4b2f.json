You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "Thank you for the calculation. Let's use the algebraic solution to understand it better with exact values and not decimals. We can directly reason to ensure the results make sense.\nGiven:\n1. Emil's current age is 21.\n2. When Emil is 26, he will be twice the age of his brother and half the age of his dad.\n\nFrom this information, we had the equations:\n- \\( 26 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (d + 5) \\)\n- \\( 26 = 2 \\times (b + 5) \\)\n\nSolving these gives:\n- \\( d + 5 = 2 \\times 26 \\)\n- \\( b + 5 = \\frac{26}{2} \\)\n\nLet's validate these steps with calculations:\n\n1. Since Emil will be half the age of his dad when Emil is 26:\n   \\[\n   d + 5 = 2 \\times 26 \\implies d + 5 = 52 \\implies d = 47\n   \\]\n\n2. Since Emil will be twice the age of his brother when Emil is 26:\n   \\[\n   26 = 2 \\times (b + 5) \\implies b + 5 = 13 \\implies b = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, Emil's dad is currently 47, and his brother is currently 8. The sum of their current ages is:\n\\[ \nd + b = 47 + 8 = 55\n\\]\n\nOverall, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{55}\n\\]"
