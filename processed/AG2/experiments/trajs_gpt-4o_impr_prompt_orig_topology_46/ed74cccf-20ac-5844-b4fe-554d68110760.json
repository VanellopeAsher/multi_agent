Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. There are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step and calculate the total number of students involved in each activity.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of students playing each sport.\n- There are 6 students playing tennis.\n- There are twice as many students playing volleyball as playing tennis. Therefore, there are \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) students playing volleyball.\n- The problem states there are some boys and 22 girls playing soccer. Since we are only required to find the total number of students, we can denote the number of boys playing soccer as \\(b\\). Therefore, the total number of students playing soccer is \\(b + 22\\).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of students.\n- The total number of students is the sum of students playing each sport:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total students} = 6 \\, (\\text{tennis}) + 12 \\, (\\text{volleyball}) + (b + 22) \\, (\\text{soccer})\n  \\]\n  Simplifying this gives:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total students} = 18 + b + 22 = b + 40\n  \\]\n\nSince there is no information on the number of boys (\\(b\\)) playing soccer, we cannot determine the exact number of students. Therefore, using the placeholder \\(b\\), we represent the answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\]\n\nThis indicates the total number of students cannot be determined with the given information."
