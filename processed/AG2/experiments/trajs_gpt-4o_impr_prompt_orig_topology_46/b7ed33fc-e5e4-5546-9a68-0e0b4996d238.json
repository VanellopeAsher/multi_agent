      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

      "content": "**Key Concept:**\n\nLet's determine the total time it takes John to complete different types of Sudoku puzzles and then calculate how many bottles of water he drinks during that time.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the time for each Sudoku type:**\n\n   - **Normal Sudoku:** 30 minutes.\n   \n   - **Extreme Sudoku:** 3 times the time of a normal Sudoku.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Extreme Sudoku time} = 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Total Time:**\n\n   John will complete one normal Sudoku and one extreme Sudoku:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Time} = 30 \\text{ minutes} + 90 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Bottles of Water:**\n\n   John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes. So, we divide the total time by 30 to find out how many bottles he drinks.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bottles of Water} = \\frac{120}{30} = 4\n   \\]\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Normal Sudoku Time: 30 minutes.\n2. Extreme Sudoku Time: \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) minutes.\n3. Total Time: \\(30 + 90 = 120\\) minutes.\n4. Bottles of Water: \\( \\frac{120}{30} = 4\\).\n\nEach calculation step checks out correctly.\n\n\\(\\boxed{4}\\)"
