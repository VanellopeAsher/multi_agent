Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three are wearing 2.5-inch heels.

      "content": "To determine the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we can use a straightforward weighted average calculation. Let's break down the steps needed to solve this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify Parameters:**\n   - Number of women wearing 4.5-inch heels = 3\n   - Height of these heels = 4.5 inches\n   - Number of women wearing 2.5-inch heels = 3\n   - Height of these heels = 2.5 inches\n\n2. **Calculate Total Height of Heels:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total height of 4.5-inch heels} = 3 \\times 4.5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total height of 2.5-inch heels} = 3 \\times 2.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Number of Women:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of women} = 3 + 3 = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Average Height of Heels:**\n   The average height of the heels can be found by dividing the sum of all heel heights by the total number of women wearing heels:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average height} = \\frac{\\text{Total height of all heels}}{6}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute using Python code:**\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Number of women and heel heights\nnum_4_5_inches = 3\nnum_2_5_inches = 3\nheight_4_5 = Rational(9, 2)  # 4.5 inches\nheight_2_5 = Rational(5, 2)  # 2.5 inches\n\n# Total height of all heels\ntotal_height = (num_4_5_inches * height_4_5) + (num_2_5_inches * height_2_5)\n\n# Total number of women\ntotal_women = num_4_5_inches + num_2_5_inches\n\n# Average height\naverage_height = total_height / total_women\n\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Confirm Total Heights:**\n   - \\( \\text{Total height of 4.5-inch heels} = 3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5 \\)\n   - \\( \\text{Total height of 2.5-inch heels} = 3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\)\n   - \\( \\text{Total height} = 13.5 + 7.5 = 21 \\)\n\n2. **Confirm Average:**\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5 \\) inches.\n\nAfter repeating these calculations and verifying each one systematically, the average height of the heels is indeed 3.5 inches.\n\n\\(\\boxed{3.5}\\)"

Let's ensure the format remains correct using the fraction form.\n\nThe solution to find the average height of the heels, given that 3 women are wearing 4.5-inch heels and 3 women are wearing 2.5-inch heels, can be calculated as follows:\n\nGiven:\n- The total height from the 4.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5\\).\n- The total height from the 2.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\).\n- The total height is \\(13.5 + 7.5 = 21\\).\n- The number of women is 6.\n\nSo the average height in fraction form:\n\\[ \n\\text{Average height} = \\frac{21}{6} = \\frac{7}{2} \n\\]\n\nThus, the average height of the heels is \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\) inches.\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}\\)"
