Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Direct Python Solution approach, employing straightforward arithmetic calculations. We need to determine how much ribbon Monica can allocate for each bow, given she has a total of 12 presents (6 for family, 4 for friends, and 2 for teachers) and 144 inches of ribbon.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of presents: \n   \\[\n   \\text{total presents} = \\text{family presents} + \\text{friends presents} + \\text{teachers presents} = 6 + 4 + 2\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of presents to determine the ribbon allocated per present:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ribbon per present} = \\frac{\\text{total ribbon}}{\\text{total presents}} = \\frac{144}{12}\n   \\]\n\nLet's proceed with these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the total number of presents\ntotal_presents = 6 + 4 + 2\n\n# Calculate ribbon per present\nribbon_per_present = Rational(144, total_presents)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(ribbon_per_present)\n```\n\nThis program performs the division with fractions, ensuring we adhere to the requirement of using fractions instead of decimals.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Presents:**  \n   Verify by adding the numbers:\n   \\[\n   6 + 4 + 2 = 12\n   \\]\n   The total number of presents is correctly calculated.\n\n2. **Distribute Ribbon:**  \n   Verify that the allocation is correct:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{144}{12} = 12\n   \\]\n   Each present receives 12 inches of ribbon.\n\nThus, each present can have a bow made with 12 inches of ribbon. We have verified our calculation step-by-step to ensure accuracy.\n\nTherefore, the length of ribbon per present is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
