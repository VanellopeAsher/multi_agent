Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "To solve the problem in a structured approach, let's apply Case 1: Direct Python Solution using the sympy library.\n\n### Key Idea:\nWe will determine the number of shells each girl brought back by using the given conditions: \n- Both groups have an equal number of kids. \n- Each boy brought back 600 seashells.\n- The girls collectively brought back the same number of shells as the boys plus four times as many seashells.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Calculate the number of boys.\n2. Determine the total number of seashells for the boys.\n3. Calculate the number of seashells the girls collectively should bring back.\n4. Determine the amount each girl brought based on the collective amount.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Number of kids in each group (boys or girls)\ntotal_kids = 200\nkids_per_group = total_kids // 2\n\n# Shells brought back by each boy\nshells_per_boy = 600\n\n# Total shells brought by boys\ntotal_shells_boys = kids_per_group * shells_per_boy\n\n# We define x as the number of seashells each girl brought back\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total shells brought by girls\ntotal_shells_girls = total_shells_boys + 4 * total_shells_boys\n\n# Set up the equation for the shells brought by each girl\nequation = Eq(kids_per_group * x, total_shells_girls)\n\n# Solve for x\nshells_per_girl = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(shells_per_girl)\n```\n\nThe code calculates the number of seashells each girl brought. Let's run through the logic and verify the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Number of Boys and Girls**: \n   - They are split equally: \\(\\frac{200}{2} = 100\\) boys and \\(100\\) girls.\n\n2. **Total Number of Seashells Brought by Boys**:\n   - Boys' total: \\(100 \\times 600 = 60,000\\).\n\n3. **Total Number of Seashells Brought by Girls**:\n   - Girls' total: \\(60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 300,000\\).\n\n4. **Number of Seashells Brought by Each Girl**:\n   - Each girl brings back \\(\\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000\\).\n\nSo, each girl brought back 3,000 seashells. Let's verify:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Total boys' seashells: \\(100 \\times 600 = 60,000\\).\n2. Boys' and additional seashells for girls: \\(60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000\\).\n3. Therefore, each girl brought back: \\( \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000 \\).\n\nThis verification checks out, confirming the solution. \n\n\\(\\boxed{3000}\\)"
