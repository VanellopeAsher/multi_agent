      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark has $50.5 in his bank account. He earns $12.5 per day at his work. If he wants to buy a bike that costs $300.5, how many days does Mark have to save his money?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will calculate how many days it will take for Mark to save enough money to buy a bike costing $300.5, given that he starts with $50.5 and earns $12.5 per day.\n\n### Key Idea:\n\nSince Mark earns $12.5 per day, we will calculate the total number of days it will take for his balance to reach $300.5. This involves setting up a simple equation to solve for the number of days.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Determine Total Amount Needed:** Mark wants $300.5 for the bike. He currently has $50.5.\n2. **Calculate Amount Needed:** Determine how much more he needs to save by subtracting his current amount from the total needed: \\(300.5 - 50.5\\).\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Needed:** Divide the amount he needs by the amount he earns per day ($12.5).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, solve, symbols\n\n# Define the variables\ndaily_earnings = Rational(125, 10)  # $12.5 as a fraction\ncurrent_savings = Rational(505, 10)  # $50.5 as a fraction\nbike_cost = Rational(3005, 10)  # $300.5 as a fraction\n\n# Total amount Mark needs to save\namount_needed = bike_cost - current_savings\n\n# Define the number of days as a symbol\nd = symbols('d')\n\n# Equation to solve: savings + daily_earnings * d = bike_cost\n# => daily_earnings * d = amount_needed\nequation = daily_earnings * d - amount_needed\n\n# Solve for d\ndays_required = solve(equation, d)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f'The number of days Mark has to save his money is: {days_required}')\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Calculate the Difference:** \\(300.5 - 50.5 = 250.0\\).\n2. **Divide by Daily Earnings:** \\(\\frac{250.0}{12.5} = 20\\).\n\nVerified that the result matches our manual calculation.\n\nThus, the number of days Mark has to save his money is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
