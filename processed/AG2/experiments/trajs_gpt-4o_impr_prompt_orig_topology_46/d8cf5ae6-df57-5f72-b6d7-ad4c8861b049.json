  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed the farmer needs to transport and then determine how much the farm truck can carry per trip given that it needs to be done in two trips. Here's how we'll proceed:\n\n### Step-by-step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Weight**:\n   - Calculate the total weight of sugar cubes.\n   - Calculate the total weight of carrots.\n   - Calculate the total weight of hay.\n   - Calculate the total weight of oats.\n   - Sum up all these weights to find the total feed weight.\n\n2. **Determine the Truck Capacity**:\n   - Given that the farmer can transport all of the feed in two trips, divide the total weight by 2 to find the capacity of the truck per trip.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python using the specified format:\n\n```python\n# Define the weights of individual feed components\nsugar_cubes_weight = 2 * 1  # 2 boxes of 1 pound each\ncarrots_weight = 4 * 12     # 4 bags of 12 pounds each\nhay_weight = 42 * 75        # 42 bales of 75 pounds each\noats_weight = 20 * 65       # 20 sacks of 65 pounds each\n\n# Calculate total weight of all the feed\ntotal_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight\n\n# Calculate the truck capacity per trip\ntruck_capacity_per_trip = total_weight / 2\n\n# Print the results in the required format\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(\"Truck capacity per trip:\")\nprint(Rational(total_weight, 2))  # Using Rational to maintain fractions if necessary\n```\n\nLet's perform the calculations in detail:\n\n1. Sugar cubes: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) pounds\n2. Carrots: \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) pounds\n3. Hay: \\(42 \\times 75 = 3150\\) pounds\n4. Oats: \\(20 \\times 65 = 1300\\) pounds\n\nTotal weight: \\(2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500\\) pounds.\n\nSince the farmer transports this in two trips:\n\n\\[ \\text{Truck Capacity per Trip} = \\frac{4500}{2} = 2250 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. Sugar Cubes: Checked correctly with \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) pounds.\n2. Carrots: Checked and correct \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) pounds.\n3. Hay: Confirmed correct \\(42 \\times 75 = 3150\\) pounds.\n4. Oats: Correctly calculated \\(20 \\times 65 = 1300\\) pounds.\n5. Total Weight: \\(2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500\\) pounds, verified.\n6. Truck Capacity per Trip: \\(\\frac{4500}{2} = 2250\\) pounds, match with calculations.\n\nFinal result: \\(\\boxed{2250}\\) pounds per trip."
