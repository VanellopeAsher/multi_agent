Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are 80 deer in a field.  30 percent of them are bucks.  50 percent of the bucks are 6 points.  How many 6 point bucks are there?"

Let's break down the steps needed to solve it:\n\n1. **Find the number of bucks:**\n   - 30% of the deer are bucks.\n   \n2. **Calculate the number of 6-point bucks:**\n   - 50% of the bucks are 6-point bucks.\n\nLet's solve this using Python and the sympy library to ensure precision and use of fraction calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of deer\ntotal_deer = 80\n\n# Percentage of bucks\npercentage_bucks = Rational(30, 100)  # 30%\n\n# Calculate the number of bucks\nnum_bucks = total_deer * percentage_bucks\n\n# Percentage of 6-point bucks\npercentage_6_point = Rational(50, 100)  # 50%\n\n# Calculate the number of 6-point bucks\nnum_6_point_bucks = num_bucks * percentage_6_point\n\n# Output the result\nprint(num_6_point_bucks)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. Calculate the number of bucks:\n   - 30% of 80 deer are bucks: \\((\\frac{30}{100}) \\times 80 = 24\\).\n   \n2. Calculate the number of 6-point bucks:\n   - 50% of the 24 bucks are 6-point: \\((\\frac{50}{100}) \\times 24 = 12\\).\n\nThe calculations align with the code, confirming that the logic and solution are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 6-point bucks is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
