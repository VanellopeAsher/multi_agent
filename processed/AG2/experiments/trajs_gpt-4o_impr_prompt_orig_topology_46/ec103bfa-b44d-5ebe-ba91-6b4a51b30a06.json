Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $900. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $57?"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can set up an equation based on the cost of items she bought and the total amount she paid.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n\n1. **Cost of Chicken Meal**: $120\n2. **Cost of Milk Packs**: 5 packs × $30 each = \\( 5 \\times 30 \\)\n3. **Cost of Apples**: 40 apples × $1.50 each = \\( 40 \\times 1.50 \\)\n4. **Cost of Pizza Boxes**: Let \\( x \\) be the number of pizza boxes. The cost per box is $57, so the cost for \\( x \\) boxes is \\( 57x \\).\n5. **Total Amount Paid**: $900\n\n### Equation Setup\n\nWe need to set up an equation to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 120 + (5 \\times 30) + (40 \\times 1.50) + 57x = 900 \\]\n\n### Solve the Equation\n\nNow, let's use Python to solve the equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation based on the breakdown\nequation = Eq(120 + (5 * 30) + (40 * 1.50) + 57*x, 900)\n\n# Solve the equation\npizza_boxes = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(pizza_boxes)\n```\n\n### Execute the Solution\n\nRun the code to calculate the number of pizza boxes.\n\nOnce you have executed the code, verify the calculation step by step:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n- **Cost calculation:**\n  - Chicken Meal: $120\n  - Milk Packs: \\( 5 \\times 30 = 150 \\)\n  - Apples: \\( 40 \\times 1.50 = 60 \\)\n  - Total Known Costs (excluding pizza): \\( 120 + 150 + 60 = 330 \\)\n  \n- **Calculate remaining cost for pizzas:**\n  - Total Paid: $900\n  - Therefore, cost of pizzas is \\( 900 - 330 = 570 \\)\n  \n- **Pizza box calculation:**\n  - Each box costs $57, solving \\( 57x = 570 \\) gives \\( x = 10 \\)\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter verifying the calculations:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n\nMarie ordered 10 boxes of pizza."
