Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBrittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and much fewer white squares than green squares.  Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet. How much fewer are white squares  than green squares?"

We also know the total area of the comforter. Let's define the variables and equations accordingly.\n\n1. Define the variables:\n   - Let \\( r \\) be the number of red squares.\n   - Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue squares.\n   - Let \\( g \\) be the number of green squares.\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the number of white squares.\n\n2. Identify relationships between variables from the problem statement:\n   - \\( r = 14 \\)\n   - \\( b = r + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18 \\)\n   - \\( g = b + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \\)\n   - The total number of squares is \\( 68 \\).\n\n3. Formulate the equation for the total area:\n   \\[\n   r + b + g + w = 68\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for the number of white squares:\n   \\[\n   w = 68 - r - b - g\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the difference between the number of green squares and white squares:\n   \\[\n   g - w\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Define the symbols\nr, b, g, w = symbols('r b g w')\n\n# Step 2: Define known quantities\nr_value = 14\nb_value = r_value + 4\ng_value = b_value + 6\n\n# Step 3: Write the equation for total squares\nequation = Eq(r_value + b_value + g_value + w, 68)\n\n# Step 4: Solve for the number of white squares\nw_value = solve(equation, w)[0]\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the difference between green squares and white squares\ndifference = g_value - w_value\n\n# Step 6: Print the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify each step:\n- Start by calculating the numbers of each type:\n  - Red Squares \\( r = 14 \\)\n  - Blue Squares \\( b = 18 \\)\n  - Green Squares \\( g = 24 \\)\n\n- Calculate the equation:\n  \\[\n  14 + 18 + 24 + w = 68 \\implies w = 68 - 56 = 12\n  \\]\n\n- Calculate the difference:\n  \\[\n  g - w = 24 - 12 = 12\n  \\]\n\nThus, the number of white squares is indeed 12 fewer than the number of green squares, confirming our solution is correct.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
