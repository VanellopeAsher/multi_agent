Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn is a carpenter. For his friend Ali, he manufactured 40 wooden tables for $200 each and 20 roof frames for $100 each. How much does Ali have to pay John?"

      "content": "To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to find the total cost of the tables and the roof frames. Let's go through a step-by-step process:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of wooden tables:**\n   - John manufactured 40 wooden tables.\n   - Each table costs $200.\n   - Total cost for tables = Number of tables × Cost per table\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of roof frames:**\n   - John manufactured 20 roof frames.\n   - Each roof frame costs $100.\n   - Total cost for roof frames = Number of roof frames × Cost per roof frame\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - Total cost = Total cost for tables + Total cost for roof frames\n\n### Calculation Using Python:\nWe'll use Python to compute the above calculations.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the cost of wooden tables\nnumber_of_tables = 40\ncost_per_table = 200\ntotal_cost_tables = number_of_tables * cost_per_table\n\n# Calculate the cost of roof frames\nnumber_of_roof_frames = 20\ncost_per_roof_frame = 100\ntotal_cost_roof_frames = number_of_roof_frames * cost_per_roof_frame\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = total_cost_tables + total_cost_roof_frames\n\n# Display the result\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\n### Verification:\n1. **Verify Cost of Tables:**\n   - Number of tables = 40\n   - Cost per table = $200\n   - Total cost for tables = 40 × 200 = $8000\n\n2. **Verify Cost of Roof Frames:**\n   - Number of roof frames = 20\n   - Cost per roof frame = $100\n   - Total cost for roof frames = 20 × 100 = $2000\n\n3. **Verify Total Cost:**\n   - Total cost = $8000 + $2000 = $10000\n\nAfter verification, the calculations are correct, and we can confidently say that Ali has to pay John \\(\\boxed{10000}\\) dollars."
