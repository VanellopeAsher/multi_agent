Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step using algebraic equations. \n\nWe know:\n\n1. Carver's age: 45 years old.\n2. Carver's age is 5 years younger than twice his daughter's age.\n3. The daughter is 4 years older than three times the son's age.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- Let \\( d \\) be the age of Carver's daughter.\n- Let \\( s \\) be the age of Carver's son.\n\nFrom the information given, we can create these equations:\n\n1. \\( 45 = 2d - 5 \\)  (Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his daughter's age.)\n2. \\( d = 3s + 4 \\)  (His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son.)\n\nWe'll solve these equations step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Solve for the daughter's age (\\( d \\)) from equation 1.\n\n\\[ \n45 = 2d - 5 \n\\]\n\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n\n\\[ \n45 + 5 = 2d \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n50 = 2d \n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ \nd = 25 \n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the value of \\( d \\) to solve for the son's age (\\( s \\)).\n\nSubstitute \\( d = 25 \\) into equation 2:\n\n\\[ \n25 = 3s + 4 \n\\]\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[ \n25 - 4 = 3s \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n21 = 3s \n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ \ns = 7 \n\\]\n\nSo, the son's age is 7 years.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify:\n\n- Calculate the daughter's age using Carver's equation:\n  \\[\n  45 = 2d - 5 \\implies d = 25 \n  \\]\n  This matches the value we calculated.\n\n- Calculate the daughter's age using the son's equation:\n  \\[\n  d = 3s + 4 \\implies d = 3 \\times 7 + 4 = 21 + 4 = 25\n  \\]\n  This matches as well.\n\nBoth checks confirm that our solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: \\(\\boxed{7}\\) (Carver's son is 7 years old.)"
