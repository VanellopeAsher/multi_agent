Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the smallest piece Marty will get after making the specified cuts.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n1. First, divide the original ribbon into 4 equal parts. Each of these parts will be \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the total ribbon.\n2. Then, each of these parts will be further divided into 5 equal parts, so each final piece will be \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of each \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) piece.\n3. Hence, each final piece will be \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{20}\\) of the total ribbon.\n\nLet's confirm this using Python with the sympy library for exact calculations in fractions:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total ribbon length is considered as 1 for simplicity\nribbon_length = 1\n\n# First cut: Divide into 4 equal parts\nfirst_cut_part = Rational(ribbon_length, 4)\n\n# Second cut: Each part is divided into 5 equal parts\nfinal_cut_part = Rational(first_cut_part, 5)\n\nprint(f\"The length of each final cut piece is: {final_cut_part}\")\n```\n\nThe result from this calculation gives us \\(\\frac{1}{20}\\).\n\n**Verification:**\n1. Original ribbon divided into 4 parts -> Length of each = \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of original.\n2. Each \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) part further divided into 5 pieces -> Length of each = \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n3. Final length of each small piece = \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{20}\\).\n\nEverything checks out with the reasoning and calculation.\nThus, the length of each final piece is  \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{20}}\\)."
