Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSam ran 3.5 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5.5 miles.  How many miles did Sam run this week?"

Let's make sure no steps are missed and provide a detailed breakdown and confirmation.\n\nHere's the solution revisited and confirmed:\n\n1. **Days and Distances:**\n   - **Monday, Wednesday, Friday:** Each day, Sam runs 3.5 miles, equivalent to \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\) miles.\n   - **Tuesday, Thursday:** Each day, Sam runs 5.5 miles, equivalent to \\(\\frac{11}{2}\\) miles.\n\n2. **Total Miles Calculation:**\n\n   - For **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total for M, W, F} = 3 \\times \\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{21}{2} \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n   - For **Tuesday and Thursday:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total for T, T} = 2 \\times \\frac{11}{2} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sum the results for all days:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{2} + 11 = \\frac{21}{2} + \\frac{22}{2} = \\frac{43}{2} \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   Sam ran a total of \\(\\boxed{\\frac{43}{2}}\\) miles this week.\n\nHere is the code to perform these calculations one more time, confirming the correctness of the previous computation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Define the distances using Rational to maintain precision as fractions:\nmonday_wednesday_friday_run = Rational(7, 2)  # 3.5 miles\ntuesday_thursday_run = Rational(11, 2)  # 5.5 miles\n\n# Calculate the total miles for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\ntotal_run_mwf = 3 * monday_wednesday_friday_run\n\n# Calculate the total miles for Tuesday and Thursday\ntotal_run_tt = 2 * tuesday_thursday_run\n\n# Calculate the total mileage for the week\ntotal_miles = total_run_mwf + total_run_tt\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_miles)\n```\n\nIn summary, each calculation and verification aligns with the final result: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{43}{2}}\\) miles.
