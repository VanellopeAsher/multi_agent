Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number.

      "content": "To tackle the problem, we need to determine the initial number reported by Courtney. We know that Kelly claims Courtney overstated the actual audience size by 20%, and the actual audience in attendance was 40 people.\n\nLet's break this down into manageable steps:\n\n1. Define the actual audience number: \\( A = 40 \\).\n2. Let \\( C \\) be the number Courtney reported.\n3. According to Kelly, Courtney overstated by 20%, meaning Courtney's figure \\( C \\) is actually 120% of the real audience \\( A \\).\n\nThus, we have the following equation:\n\\[ C = 1.2 \\times A \\]\n\nWe will solve this using Python by substituting \\( A = 40 \\) into the equation.\n\n```python\n# your code\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Step 1: Define the actual audience size\nA = 40\n\n# Step 2: Symbolic representation for Courtney's reported audience size\nC = symbols('C')\n\n# Step 3: Create the equation and solve for C\nequation = Eq(C, 1.2 * A)\ncourtney_reported_size = solve(equation, C)[0]\n\n# Step 4: Display the solution\nprint(courtney_reported_size)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nNow, let's verify the solution:\n\n1. We computed that \\( C = 1.2 \\times A \\).\n2. Substitute the correct audience size \\( A = 40 \\):  \n   \\[\n   C = 1.2 \\times 40 = 48\n   \\]\n3. Hence, Courtney reported that the audience size was 48 people.\n\nTherefore, with verification complete and the computation checked, we conclude:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]"
