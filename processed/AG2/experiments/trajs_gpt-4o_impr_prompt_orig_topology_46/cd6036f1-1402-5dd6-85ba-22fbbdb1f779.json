Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. During his recovery, he managed to regain 5 pounds per month for 2 months. If his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight before he fell ill?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's first articulate the steps necessary:\n\nMark lost weight for 3 months at a rate of 10 pounds per month. Then, he regained weight for 2 months at a rate of 5 pounds per month. Finally, we find that his weight was 70 pounds after the recovery period.\n\nTo find Mark's initial weight, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight loss over the 3 months.\n2. Calculate the total weight gain over the 2 months of recovery.\n3. Determine Mark's initial weight before he fell ill using these values and his final weight.\n\nLet's break these steps into a Python script using the specified format:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Let W be Mark's initial weight\nW = symbols('W')\n\n# Calculate the total weight loss in the first 3 months\nweight_loss = 3 * 10\n\n# Calculate the total weight gain in the next 2 months\nweight_gain = 2 * 5\n\n# Setup the equation based on the final weight\nfinal_weight = 70\nequation = Eq(W - weight_loss + weight_gain, final_weight)\n\n# Solve the equation for W\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, W)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nNow, let's verify this solution step by step:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Calculate the total weight loss:  \n   Weight loss over 3 months = \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) pounds.\n\n2. Calculate the total weight gain:  \n   Weight gain over 2 months = \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) pounds.\n\n3. Formulate the equation:  \n   Let \\(W\\) be the initial weight.  \n   After the period of losing and gaining weight, we have:  \n   \\(W - 30 + 10 = 70\\).  \n   Simplifying gives \\(W - 20 = 70\\).\n\n4. Solve the equation for \\(W\\):  \n   \\(W = 70 + 20 = 90\\).\n\nThe initial weight of Mark before he fell ill was \\(\\boxed{90}\\) pounds."
