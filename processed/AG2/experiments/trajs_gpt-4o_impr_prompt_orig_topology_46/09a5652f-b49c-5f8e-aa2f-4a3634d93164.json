Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and a half as much the other two days he runs. He rests for 2 hours after each run. How fast does he run?"

The goal is to find John's running speed.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Hours John Runs Weekly**: \n   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.\n   - He runs half as much on the other two days, which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours each day.\n   - Total hours run in a week = \\( 3 + 1.5 \\times 2 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Weekly Mileage**: \n   - Given: John runs 60 miles a week.\n\n3. **Calculate John's Running Speed**:\n   - Use the formula: \\(\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\\).\n\nLet's compute these steps using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate total running hours in a week\nday1_hours = 3\nday2_hours = Rational(day1_hours, 2) # 1.5 hours\nday3_hours = day2_hours              # 1.5 hours\n\ntotal_running_hours = day1_hours + day2_hours + day3_hours\n\n# Step 2: Given total distance\ntotal_miles = 60\n\n# Step 3: Calculate John's speed\nrunning_speed = total_miles / total_running_hours\n\n# Output John's running speed\nprint(f\"John's running speed is {running_speed} miles per hour.\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Total Running Hours**:\n   - First Day: 3 hours.\n   - Second Day: 1.5 hours.\n   - Third Day: 1.5 hours.\n   - Total hours = \\(3 + 1.5 \\times 2 = 6\\) hours.\n   \n2. **Total Distance**:\n   - Confirmed as 60 miles.\n\n3. **Running Speed Calculation**:\n   - \\(\\text{Speed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10\\) miles per hour.\n\nUpon verification, John's speed is indeed \\( \\boxed{10} \\) miles per hour."
