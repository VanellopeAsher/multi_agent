Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases on the third day so that the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons, calculate the increase amount in the third day."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will consider the changes in water volume passing through a river in a series of days:\n\n- **Day 1:** The amount of water passing through is 4000 gallons.\n- **Day 2:** Due to a day of heavy rain, this amount doubles. Hence, the water volume becomes \\(2 \\times 4000 = 8000\\) gallons.\n- **Day 3:** The total amount of water increases to 14,000 gallons.\n\nWe need to calculate the increase in the volume of water on the third day. We can compute this by subtracting the amount on the second day from the amount on the third day.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Initial amount on Day 1\nday1 = 4000\n\n# Amount on Day 2 (doubles after rain)\nday2 = 2 * day1\n\n# Total amount on Day 3\ntotal_day3 = 14000\n\n# Increase in water volume on Day 3\nincrease_day3 = total_day3 - day2\n\n# Display the result\nprint(increase_day3)\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet's verify the calculations:\n\n1. **Day 1:** 4000 gallons (given).\n2. **Day 2:** After heavy rain, the volume doubles: \\(2 \\times 4000 = 8000\\) gallons.\n3. **Day 3:** The amount is 14,000 gallons.\n4. **Increase on Day 3:** \\(14000 - 8000 = 6000\\) gallons.\n\nEach step checks out, and the operations are accurate. Therefore, the increase in the amount of water on the third day is \\(\\boxed{6000}\\) gallons."
