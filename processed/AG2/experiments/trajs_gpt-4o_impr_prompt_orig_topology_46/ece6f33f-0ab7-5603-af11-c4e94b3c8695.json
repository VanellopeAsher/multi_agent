Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJenna shares her living space with four other people. The monthly cost for electricity in their shared home is $100. If they split the cost evenly, what would be the annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we will use a step-by-step process as it involves basic arithmetic calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Determine the Monthly Contribution:**\n   - The total monthly electricity cost is $100.\n   - There are 5 people in total (Jenna plus 4 others) sharing the cost.\n   - The monthly contribution per person is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of people.\n\n2. **Calculate the Annual Contribution:**\n   - Once we know the monthly contribution per person, we can find the annual contribution by multiplying the monthly contribution by the number of months in a year (12).\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - Use the `print` function to display the result in the requested format.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the monthly contribution per person\ntotal_monthly_cost = 100  # The total electricity cost per month\nnumber_of_people = 5  # The total number of people sharing the cost\n\nmonthly_contribution_per_person = total_monthly_cost / number_of_people\n\n# Calculate the annual contribution per person\nmonths_in_a_year = 12\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_contribution_per_person * months_in_a_year\n\n# Output the result formatted as requested\nprint(\"The annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill is:\", annual_contribution_per_person)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Monthly Contribution Calculation:**\n   - $100 รท 5 = $20 per person per month.\n2. **Annual Contribution Calculation:**\n   - $20 ร 12 = $240 per person per year.\n\nThe results are verified to be accurate.\n\nThe final annual contribution of each roommate towards the electricity bill is \\(\\boxed{240}\\)."
