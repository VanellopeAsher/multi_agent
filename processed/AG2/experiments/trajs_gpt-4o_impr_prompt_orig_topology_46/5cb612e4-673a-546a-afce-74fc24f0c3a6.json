Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. Each bag of wheat weighs 60 pounds. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to compute the number of bags sold by the trader using the given data concerning costs, selling price, and profit.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( n \\) be the number of bags sold.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost:**\n   - The total cost of buying the wheat = \\( 20n \\) dollars (since each bag costs $20).\n   - The total cost of transporting the wheat = \\( 2n \\) dollars (since each bag costs $2 to transport).\n\n3. **Total Revenue:**\n   - The revenue made from selling the bags = \\( 30n \\) dollars (since each bag is sold at $30).\n\n4. **Profit Calculation:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of buying + Cost of transporting = \\( 20n + 2n = 22n \\) dollars.\n   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = \\( 30n - 22n = 8n \\).\n\n5. **Set up Equation for Profit:**\n   - According to the problem, the profit is $400.\n   - Therefore, \\( 8n = 400 \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n   - We can solve this equation to find \\( n \\).\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python for accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# Define the equation for profit\nequation = Eq(8 * n, 400)\n\n# Solve the equation for n\nbags_sold = solve(equation, n)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(bags_sold)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- Calculate both total cost and total revenue when \\( n = 50 \\):\n  - Total cost for 50 bags: \\( 20 \\times 50 + 2 \\times 50 = 1000 + 100 = \\$1100 \\)\n  - Total revenue for 50 bags: \\( 30 \\times 50 = \\$1500 \\)\n  - Profit: \\( 1500 - 1100 = \\$400 \\)\n\nThe calculations verify that selling 50 bags results in a profit of $400.
