Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAli has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Ali's sister gives half of the money she receives to his mother.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into several logical steps using Python for computational clarity:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount in dollars Ali initially has.\n2. Determine how much money Ali gives to his sister.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount of money Ali has after giving to his sister, and how much he spends on dinner.\n4. Determine how much money Ali has left after buying dinner.\n\nLet's use Python and `sympy` for precise calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, simplify\n\n# Initial amounts\nten_dollar_bills = 4\ntwenty_dollar_bills = 6\n\n# Calculate total initial money Ali has\ninitial_amount = (ten_dollar_bills * 10) + (twenty_dollar_bills * 20)\n\n# Ali gives half of his total money to his sister\namount_given_to_sister = Rational(initial_amount, 2)\n\n# Remaining money after giving to his sister\nremaining_after_sister = initial_amount - amount_given_to_sister\n\n# Ali spends 3/5 of the remaining money on dinner\namount_spent_on_dinner = simplify(Rational(3, 5) * remaining_after_sister)\n\n# Remaining money after spending on dinner\nremaining_money_after_dinner = remaining_after_sister - amount_spent_on_dinner\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:\", remaining_money_after_dinner)\n```\n\nNow, let's walk through the steps to verify the results:\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Initial Calculation:**\n   - Ali starts with 4 $\\times$ $10 + 6 \\times $20 = $40 + $120 = $160.\n\n2. **Giving to Sister:**\n   - Ali gives half of $160, which is $160 / 2 = $80 to his sister.\n\n3. **Remaining Money Calculation:**\n   - After giving the money to his sister, Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.\n\n4. **Spending on Dinner:**\n   - Ali spends 3/5 of $80 on dinner, which equals $80 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = $48.\n\n5. **Final Amount:**\n   - The remaining amount after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is \\(\\boxed{32}\\)."
