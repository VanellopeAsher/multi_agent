Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed.

Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Comforter Fabric\n- The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.\n- Jim needs a comforter that is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.\n- Therefore, the dimensions of the comforter will be:\n  - Length: \\(6 + 2 = 8\\) feet\n  - Width: \\(8 + 2 = 10\\) feet\n- The area of the comforter fabric needed is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of Comforter} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 8 \\times 10 = 80 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n- Since Jim needs two pieces for the comforter, the total area required for the comforter is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Area for Comforter} = 2 \\times 80 = 160 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Duvet Cover Fabric\n- The size of the duvet cover Jim wants to make is 9 feet long and 11 feet wide.\n- The area of the duvet cover is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of Duvet Cover} = 9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Total Fabric Needed\n- The total fabric needed is the sum of the fabric for the comforter and the duvet cover:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Fabric Required} = 160 + 99 = 259 \\text{ square feet}\n  \\]\n\nLet's verify each calculation step and combine the results in Python for accurate computation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Dimensions of comforter\nlength_comforter = 6 + 2  # feet\nwidth_comforter = 8 + 2   # feet\n\n# Area of one comforter piece\narea_comforter_piece = length_comforter * width_comforter\n\n# Total area for two comforter pieces\ntotal_area_comforter = 2 * area_comforter_piece\n\n# Dimensions of duvet cover\nlength_duvet = 9  # feet\nwidth_duvet = 11  # feet\n\n# Area of the duvet cover\narea_duvet = length_duvet * width_duvet\n\n# Total fabric needed\ntotal_fabric_needed = total_area_comforter + area_duvet\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Total fabric Jim needs to buy:\", total_fabric_needed, \"square feet\")\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n1. Double-check comforter calculations:\n   - Each comforter piece is 8 feet by 10 feet, totaling \\(80\\) square feet.\n   - Two pieces total \\(160\\) square feet.\n\n2. Check duvet cover calculations:\n   - One duvet cover is 9 feet by 11 feet, totaling \\(99\\) square feet.\n\n3. Total fabric:\n   - Sum of the two parts is \\(160 + 99 = 259\\) square feet.\n\nThe calculations are confirmed to be correct, and the final result for the total area of fabric Jim needs to buy is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{259}\n\\]"

The calculations we went through confirm this result:\n\n- Two pieces of fabric for the comforter require 160 square feet (each piece being 8 feet by 10 feet).\n- The duvet cover requires 99 square feet (9 feet by 11 feet).\n\nAdding these together, Jim needs 259 square feet of fabric in total."
