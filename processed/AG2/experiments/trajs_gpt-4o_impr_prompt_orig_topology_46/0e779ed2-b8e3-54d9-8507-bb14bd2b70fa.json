Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

Let's use a structured approach:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the age of the sisters**:\n   - All sisters are the same age, which is \\(1.6\\) times of ten.\n   - Age of each sister = \\(1.6 \\times 10\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the age of one of the brothers**:\n   - This brother is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of 20 years old.\n   - Age of this brother = \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 20\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the age of the older brother**:\n   - The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother.\n   - Age of the older brother = \\(2 \\times \\text{Age of younger brother}\\).\n\n4. **Sum the ages of all siblings**:\n   - Total age = \\(3 \\times \\text{Age of one sister} + \\text{Age of younger brother} + \\text{Age of older brother}\\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculating the age of sisters\nage_of_sister = 1.6 * 10\n# All sisters have the same age\nage_of_all_sisters = 3 * age_of_sister\n\n# Calculating the age of the younger brother\nage_of_younger_brother = Rational(3, 5) * 20\n\n# Calculating the age of the older brother\nage_of_older_brother = 2 * age_of_younger_brother\n\n# Total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = age_of_all_sisters + age_of_younger_brother + age_of_older_brother\n\n# Print the total age (ensure it's in fraction form)\nfrom sympy import pretty\nprint(pretty(total_age))\n```\n\nLet's verify the solution:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Age of sisters**:\n   - Each sister's age = \\(1.6 \\times 10 = 16\\).\n   - Total age of sisters = \\(3 \\times 16 = 48\\).\n\n2. **Age of the younger brother**:\n   - \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Age of the older brother**:\n   - \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n\n4. **Total age**:\n   - Total age = \\(48 + 12 + 24 = 84\\).\n\nThus, the total age of all siblings is \\( \\boxed{84} \\)."
