Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, the key idea is to determine the number of messages James delivers in total by calculating how many messages he delivers to both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. James delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson.\n2. James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n- Calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu.\n- Sum the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n1. Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Number of messages to Ms. Thompson\n2. Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu\n\nWe can use Python for the necessary calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Messages to Ms. Thompson\nmessages_thompson = 84\n\n# Messages to Mr. Yu\nmessages_yu = Rational(1, 3) * messages_thompson\n\n# Total messages\ntotal_messages = messages_thompson + messages_yu\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_messages)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n1. **Messages to Ms. Thompson:** Given directly as 84.\n2. **Messages to Mr. Yu:** (1/3) * 84 = 28\n3. **Total Messages:** 84 + 28 = 112\n\nBy checking each step, we confirm that the calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of messages James delivers is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]"

However, let me reiterate the calculation for clarity:\n\n**Problem Recap:**\n\nJames delivers 84 messages to Ms. Thompson and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) as many messages to Mr. Yu. We want to find the total number of messages delivered.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1. **Messages to Ms. Thompson:** This is directly given as 84.\n2. **Messages to Mr. Yu:** \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 84 = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Messages Delivered:** \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total} = 84 + 28 = 112\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]\n\nThus, James delivers a total of 112 messages.
