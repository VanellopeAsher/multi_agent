Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDarrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their height ratio is 10:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find Allen's current age and then determine what his age will be 10 years from now. The key piece of information given is that Darrell's and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, and their total age is 162 years.\n\nWe'll approach this using the following steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify Variables**: \n   - Let Darrell's current age be \\(7x\\).\n   - Let Allen's current age be \\(11x\\), as their ages are in the ratio of 7:11.\n\n2. **Equation Setup**:\n   - The sum of their ages is given by:\n     \\[\n     7x + 11x = 162\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\)**:\n   - Combine like terms: \n     \\[\n     18x = 162\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{162}{18}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Current Ages**:\n   - Darrell's age: \\(7x\\)\n   - Allen's age: \\(11x\\)\n\n5. **Calculate Allen's Age 10 Years from Now**:\n   - Add 10 to Allen's current age.\n\nNow, let's compute these calculations using Python and the sympy library for symbolic computation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the unknown variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Setup the equation based on the total age and ratio\nequation = 7*x + 11*x - 162\n\n# Solve for x\nx_value = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Calculate Allen's current age\nallen_current_age = 11 * x_value\n\n# Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now\nallen_future_age = allen_current_age + 10\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(allen_future_age)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n- **Adding the ages**: The equation \\(7x + 11x = 162\\) simplifies to \\(18x = 162\\), which correctly gives \\(x = 9\\).\n- **Current Ages Computation**:\n  - Darrell's age is \\(7x = 7 \\times 9 = 63\\).\n  - Allen's age is \\(11x = 11 \\times 9 = 99\\).\n- **Sum of Ages**:\n  - The sum of the ages is \\(63 + 99 = 162\\), which matches the problem statement.\n- **Allen's Future Age**:\n  - Allen's age in 10 years would be \\(99 + 10 = 109\\).\n\nBased on this verification, the calculation is correct. Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{109}\n\\]"
