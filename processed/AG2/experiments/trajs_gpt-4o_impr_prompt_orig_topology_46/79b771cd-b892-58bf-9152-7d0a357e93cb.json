Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand outside the dragon's flame reach when she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n1. **Dragon's Flame Reach**: 10,000 feet.\n2. **Polly's Throw Distance (without gemstone)**: 4,000 feet.\n3. **Polly's Throw Distance (with gemstone)**: 3 times the regular throw = \\(3 \\times 4000\\, \\text{feet}\\).\n\n### Calculations\n\n1. Calculate Polly's Throw Distance with the Gemstone:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Throw Distance with gemstone} = 3 \\times 4000 = 12000\\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance outside dragon's flames} = \\text{Throw Distance with gemstone} - \\text{Dragon's Flame Reach} = 12000 - 10000\n   \\]\n\n3. This means:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance outside} = 2000\\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\n### Python Code to Solve the Problem\n\nWe can directly solve this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the reach of the dragon's flames and Polly's initial throwing capability\ndragon_flame_reach = 10000\nthrow_distance_without_gemstone = 4000\n\n# Calculate Polly's throw distance with the gemstone\nthrow_distance_with_gemstone = 3 * throw_distance_without_gemstone\n\n# Calculate how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly could stand\ndistance_outside_dragon_reach = throw_distance_with_gemstone - dragon_flame_reach\n\n# Print the result\nprint(distance_outside_dragon_reach)\n```\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\nLet's verify the result step-by-step:\n\n- Polly's initial throw distance is 4,000 feet.\n- With the gemstone, she can throw 3 times farther, so: \\(12,000\\) feet.\n- Polly needs to cover 10,000 feet to reach the dragon.\n- Thus, the distance she can safely stand outside the dragon's reach and still hit it is:\n  \\[\n  12,000 - 10,000 = 2,000\\, \\text{feet}\n  \\]\n\nThe calculations are consistent, and hence the solution is verified.\n\nFinal Result:\n\\(\\boxed{2000}\\)"
