      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon. Given that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5, can you determine the total sum of money she expended on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of both one-gallon and half-gallon jars and then calculate the total expenditure based on how many jars Cecelia purchased.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Cost of a Half-Gallon Jar:**\n    - We know that a one-gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more expensive than a half-gallon jar.\n    - Therefore, the price of a half-gallon jar will be \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n    - Cecelia bought 10 one-gallon jars, each costing $5.\n    - She also bought 16 half-gallon jars, each costing $3.\n    - Total cost for the one-gallon jars: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) dollars.\n    - Total cost for the half-gallon jars: \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Add the Total Costs:**\n    - The total expenditure will be the sum of the costs for all the jars:\n    \\[\n    50 + 48 = 98 \\text{ dollars}\n    \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this calculation in Python using the outlined approach:\n\n```python\n# Total cost of one-gallon jars\ncost_one_gallon = 10 * 5\n\n# Total cost of half-gallon jars\ncost_half_gallon = 16 * 3\n\n# Total cost of all jars\ntotal_cost = cost_one_gallon + cost_half_gallon\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nExecuting this, you will find that Cecelia spent a total of $98.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n- We manually calculated the price of the half-gallon jar as $3, and checked:\n  - 10 jars of one gallon cost: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) dollars.\n  - 16 jars of half-gallon cost: \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\) dollars.\n  \nSumming these amounts correctly gives 98 dollars, confirming our solution.\n\nTherefore, the total sum of money she expended is \\( \\boxed{98} \\)."
