Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps. Let's follow the step-by-step process:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Cards\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of basketball and baseball cards that Miss Maria has:\n\n- She has six decks of basketball cards, with each deck containing 25 cards. Therefore, the total number of basketball cards is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ basketball cards}\n  \\]\n\n- She has five boxes of baseball cards, with each box containing 40 cards. Therefore, the total number of baseball cards is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 40 = 200 \\text{ baseball cards}\n  \\]\n\n- Consequently, the total number of cards Miss Maria has is:\n  \\[\n  150 + 200 = 350 \\text{ cards}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Cards Given to Students\n\nMiss Maria keeps 50 cards after offering 10 cards to Jane (who refuses). Since she offered and then kept 50 cards:\n\n- The remaining number of cards is:\n  \\[\n  350 - 50 = 300 \\text{ cards}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Students\n\nEach student receives 10 cards. Therefore, the number of students can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\text{ students}\n\\]\n\nThus, Miss Maria has 30 students.\n\nLet's now verify these steps to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Check Total Number of Cards:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ and } 5 \\times 40 = 200, \\text{ so } 150 + 200 = 350\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verify Cards Remaining After Keeping 50:**\n   \\[\n   350 - 50 = 300 \\text{ so 300 cards are available for the students.}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify Number of Students:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300}{10} = 30, \\text{ which means each gets 10 cards.}\n   \\]\n\nEach verification step checks out, so our solution is confirmed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\(\\boxed{30}\\)"
