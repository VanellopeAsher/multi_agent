Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up several packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of water balloons that were thrown during the water balloon fight. Let's approach this with a direct plan:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Number of Balloons**: The problem states that Jolene and her friends fill up several packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. However, the number of packs is not explicitly provided.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Balloons Thrown**: The end of the problem mentions that 12 balloons are left over after the fight. We can use this information, along with the initial number of balloons from all packs, to find out how many balloons were thrown. The number of balloons thrown is the difference between the initial number of balloons and the number of balloons left.\n\nSince the total initial number of balloons isn't given, if we don't have information on the number of packs, we can't directly compute the number of balloons thrown without additional data. The problem thus cannot be solved without knowing the number of packs. Let's handle this using the Python format specified:\n\n```python\n# Calculation of balloons thrown.\n# n_packs represent the number of packs of balloons.\n# initial_balloons represents the total number of initial balloons.\n# remaining_balloons are the balloons that are left, which is 12.\n\nremaining_balloons = 12\n\n# Function to compute the number of balloons thrown\ndef balloons_thrown(n_packs):\n    initial_balloons = n_packs * 30\n    thrown_balloons = initial_balloons - remaining_balloons\n    return thrown_balloons\n\n# Since the number of packs is not provided, we cannot compute the result accurately.\n# Let's assume it's `n` for the sake of demonstrating the formula.\nfrom sympy import symbols\nn = symbols('n')  # represents the number of packs\n\n# Calculating thrown balloons in terms of n\nthrown_balloons_expression = balloons_thrown(n)\nprint(thrown_balloons_expression)\n```\n\nSince the question doesn't provide explicit details on the number of packs, ensuring the solution rests heavily on the knowledge of this variable, which is fundamentally missing. Thus, without concrete data on how many packs were initially used, the result is fundamentally:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None}} \\]\n\nas we need specific values for concrete answers."
