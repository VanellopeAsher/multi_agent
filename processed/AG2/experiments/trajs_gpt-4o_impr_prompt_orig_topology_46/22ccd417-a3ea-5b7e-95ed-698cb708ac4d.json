Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses. How many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi each time?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of one medicine combined by Saanvi for each dose. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the amount in mL of one medicine in a single dose.\n   - The amount of the second medicine in one dose will be \\( 3x \\) since it is three times the amount of the first medicine.\n\n2. **Equation Setup:**\n   - Each dose contains \\( x + 3x = 4x \\) mL of medicine in total.\n   - There are 8 doses, each containing 4x mL, leading to a total of \\( 8 \\times 4x = 32x \\) for all doses combined.\n\n3. **Total Volume Given:**\n   - We know that the total volume for the 8 doses is 448 mL.\n\n4. **Equate and Solve:**\n   - Therefore, \\( 32x = 448 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( x \\) will give us the amount of one medicine in each dose.\n\nLet's now compute this in Python using `sympy` for symbolic math:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation setup\nequation = Eq(32 * x, 448)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(f\"The amount of one medicine combined by Saanvi each time is {solution[0]} mL.\")\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. We solved the equation \\( 32x = 448 \\), which simplifies to \\( x = 14 \\).\n2. For each dose, Saanvi combines 14 mL of one medicine.\n3. Double-checking: If each dose contains 14 mL of one medicine and 42 mL (3 times) of the other, the total is \\( 14 + 42 = 56 \\) mL per dose.\n4. Across 8 doses, \\( 8 \\times 56 = 448 \\) mL, matching the given total volume.\n\nThus, the calculation is confirmed to be correct. \n\nThe final result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]"
