Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each. William bought five notebooks and a ballpen. He also decided to buy a pencil case that costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens. How much did he spend in all?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total cost of the items William bought by following these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of five notebooks:**\n   - The cost of one notebook is $1.50.\n   - The total cost for five notebooks is \\(5 \\times 1.50\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of a ballpen:**\n   - A ballpen costs $0.50.\n   - Calculate the cost for one ballpen.\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of one notebook and two ballpens:**\n   - The cost of one notebook is $1.50.\n   - The cost of two ballpens is \\(2 \\times 0.50\\).\n   - Calculate the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens by adding these two amounts.\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of the pencil case:**\n   - The pencil case costs twice the amount of one notebook and two ballpens.\n   - Multiply the result from step 3 by 2.\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount spent:**\n   - Sum up the costs from step 1 (five notebooks), step 2 (one ballpen), and step 4 (pencil case) to find the total amount spent.\n\nNow, let's put this solution into Python code using the specified conditions.\n\n```python\n# Calculate costs\ncost_of_notebook = 1.50\ncost_of_ballpen = 0.50\n\n# Cost of five notebooks\ncost_five_notebooks = 5 * cost_of_notebook\n\n# Cost of one ballpen\ncost_one_ballpen = cost_of_ballpen\n\n# Cost of one notebook and two ballpens\ncost_one_notebook_two_ballpens = cost_of_notebook + 2 * cost_of_ballpen\n\n# Cost of pencil case\ncost_pencil_case = 2 * cost_one_notebook_two_ballpens\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_five_notebooks + cost_one_ballpen + cost_pencil_case\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f'Total amount spent is ${total_cost}')\n```\n\nNow, let's verify each step to make sure we did not make any errors.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. **Cost of five notebooks:**\n   - \\(5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50\\)\n\n2. **Cost of one ballpen:**\n   - \\(0.50\\)\n\n3. **Cost of one notebook and two ballpens:**\n   - \\(1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50 = 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50\\)\n\n4. **Cost of pencil case:**\n   - \\(2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\\)\n\n5. **Total cost:**\n   - \\(7.50 + 0.50 + 5.00 = 13.00\\)\n\nThus, the total amount spent by William is \\(\\boxed{13.00}\\)."
