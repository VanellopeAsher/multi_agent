      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to keep track of the number of brownies Greta had throughout the day and how many were consumed.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Batch by Greta:** Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brownies made by Greta} = 1 \\times 12 = 12 \\text{ brownies}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Brownies from Office Party:** She got 1/2 dozen from the office.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brownies from office} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ brownies}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Brownies from Friends' Party:** Her friends had 4 dozen brownies.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brownies from friends} = 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ brownies}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Brownies at the Start of the Surprise Party:** We sum all the brownies she had from different sources.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total brownies before eating} = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \\text{ brownies}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Brownies Eaten at Party:** During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brownies eaten} = 1.5 \\times 12 = 18 \\text{ brownies}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Brownies Left Over:** Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brownies left over} = 66 - 18 = 48 \\text{ brownies}\n   \\]\n\nLet's consolidate this computation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Necessary calculations\ntotal_self = 1 * 12  # Greta's homemade brownies\ntotal_office = 0.5 * 12  # Office gift brownies\ntotal_friends = 4 * 12  # Surprise party brownies\ntotal_brownies = total_self + total_office + total_friends\n\n# Brownies eaten during the party\nbrownies_eaten = 1.5 * 12\n\n# Final count of brownies left\nbrownies_left = total_brownies - brownies_eaten\n\n# Output the result\nprint(brownies_left)\n```\n\nNow, let's go through the verification steps to ensure we've calculated everything correctly:\n\n1. **Verify Calculation of Brownies Made by Greta**: Calculation is \\(12\\), which is correct for 1 dozen.\n2. **Verify Calculation of Brownies from the Office**: Calculation is \\(6\\), which is correct for 1/2 dozen.\n3. **Verify Calculation of Brownies from Friends**: Calculation is \\(48\\), which is correct for 4 dozen.\n4. **Total Initial Brownies**: Sum of \\(12 + 6 + 48 = 66\\) is confirmed.\n5. **Verification of Brownies Eaten**: Calculation is \\(18\\), which is correct for 1 1/2 dozen.\n6. **Final Verification of Total Brownies Left**: Calculation is \\(66 - 18 = 48\\).\n\nEverything checks out, so we are confident that the number of brownies Greta has left over from the entire day is \\(\\boxed{48}\\)."
