Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first summarize the key information given:\n\n1. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs.\n2. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.\n\nWe aim to find the total number of eggs found by the friends of the Smith twins.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Eggs Found by the Smith Twins:**\n\n   Each Smith twin found 30 eggs, and there are two twins.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total eggs found by Smith twins} = 30 \\times 2 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Define Total Eggs:**\n\n   Let's denote \\( x \\) as the total number of eggs that were initially hidden.\n\n3. **Calculate Eggs Found by Friends:**\n\n   According to the problem, except for 10 eggs, all the other eggs were found by their friends. Hence, the number of eggs the friends found is:\n\n   \\[\n   x - 60 - 10\n   \\]\n\n   Since the total number of eggs equal the eggs found by the Smith twins, the eggs found by their friends, and the 10 remaining unfound eggs, we can represent it as:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 60 + (x - 60 - 10) + 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation:**\n\n   Let's solve the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 60 + x - 60 - 10 + 10\n   \\]\n\n   On simplification, we find:\n\n   \\[\n   x - x = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since the equation leads us to 0 = 0, which always holds true, we interpret that it inherently confirms that everything other than the 10 eggs were found by friends.\n\nThus, the number of eggs found by friends is:\n\n   \\[\n   x - 60 - 10 \\approx x - 70 = \\text{number of eggs friends found}\n   \\]\n\nCalculating more concretely:\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{10}\n   \\]\n\nThe friends found 70 eggs. This solution rests on the assumption that the phrase \"All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends\" means \"all the remaining eggs other than those found by the Smith twins and the 10 left unfound.\"\n\nPlease review the explanation for any necessary clarifications."
