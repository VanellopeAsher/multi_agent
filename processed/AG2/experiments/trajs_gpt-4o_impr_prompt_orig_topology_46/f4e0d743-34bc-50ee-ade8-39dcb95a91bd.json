      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Additionally, Madeline also buys a special shampoo for her dog that costs $15 per month and a toy that costs $10 every two months.

      "content": "To solve the problem of calculating Madeline's yearly expenses on her dog, we will break down the monthly expenses and then compute the annual total. Here’s the detailed process:\n\n1. **Calculate Weekly Expense for Food:**\n   - Food costs $25 per week.\n   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost for food is \\(25 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Monthly Expenses:**\n   - Treats: $20 per month.\n   - Medicine: $100 per month.\n   - Shampoo: $15 per month.\n\n3. **Calculate Bi-monthly Expense for Toy:**\n   - Toy costs $10 every two months, so the monthly cost for the toy is \\(\\frac{10}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Compute Total Monthly Expense:**\n   - Add all monthly costs together to get the total monthly expense.\n\n5. **Compute Annual Expense:**\n   - Multiply the total monthly expense by 12 (the number of months in a year) to get the annual expense.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculating Monthly Expenses\nfood_weekly_cost = 25\nweeks_per_month = 4\nmonthly_food_cost = food_weekly_cost * weeks_per_month\n\nmonthly_treat_cost = 20\nmonthly_medicine_cost = 100\nmonthly_shampoo_cost = 15\nbi_monthly_toy_cost = 10\nmonthly_toy_cost = bi_monthly_toy_cost / 2\n\n# Total Monthly Expense\ntotal_monthly_expense = (monthly_food_cost +\n                         monthly_treat_cost +\n                         monthly_medicine_cost +\n                         monthly_shampoo_cost +\n                         monthly_toy_cost)\n\n# Annual Expense\nmonths_per_year = 12\nannual_expense = total_monthly_expense * months_per_year\n\n# Output the result\nprint(annual_expense)\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Monthly Calculation:**\n  - Food: \\(25 \\times 4 = 100\\)\n  - Treats: \\(20\\)\n  - Medicine: \\(100\\)\n  - Shampoo: \\(15\\)\n  - Toy: \\(\\frac{10}{2} = 5\\)\n\n  Total Monthly Expense: \\(100 + 20 + 100 + 15 + 5 = 240\\)\n\n- **Annual Calculation:**\n  - Annual Expense: \\(240 \\times 12 = 2880\\)\n\nAfter verification, the calculation is accurate.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2880}\n\\]"
