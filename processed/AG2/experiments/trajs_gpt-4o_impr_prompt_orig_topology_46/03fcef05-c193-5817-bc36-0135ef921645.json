Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRaymond initially had $2100. Then he saved $1100 from his allowance and spent $500 on a comic book and $1900 on a puzzle. How much money does Raymond have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a direct calculation approach. We are given the following information:\n\n1. Raymond initially had $2100.\n2. Saved $1100 from his allowance.\n3. Spent $500 on a comic book.\n4. Spent $1900 on a puzzle.\n\nWe need to calculate how much money Raymond has left after these transactions. We will implement this using Python.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Raymond accumulated after saving from his allowance.\n2. Subtract the costs of the comic book and the puzzle from the accumulated amount.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial amount of money Raymond had\ninitial_amount = 2100\n\n# Amount saved from allowance\nsaved_amount = 1100\n\n# Total amount after savings\ntotal_after_saving = initial_amount + saved_amount\n\n# Money spent on comic book\ncomic_book_cost = 500\n\n# Money spent on puzzle\npuzzle_cost = 1900\n\n# Calculate remaining amount of money\nremaining_amount = total_after_saving - comic_book_cost - puzzle_cost\n\n# Print the remaining amount\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nLet's review the resulting remaining money to ensure accuracy.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Start with the initial amount of $2100.\n2. After saving $1100, Raymond's total money becomes $2100 + $1100 = $3200.\n3. He spends $500 on a comic book, leaving him with $3200 - $500 = $2700.\n4. Then, he spends $1900 on a puzzle, leaving him with $2700 - $1900 = $800.\n\nThe calculations confirm the solution. Therefore, the remaining amount of money Raymond has is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{800}\\)"
