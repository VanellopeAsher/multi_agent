Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of Karate classes Manny can miss so that the total cost per attended class does not exceed $10.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the problem:\n\n1. **Total Cost of Karate Classes:** Manny paid $60 for the Karate classes.\n2. **Total Number of Karate Classes:** There are 10 classes in total.\n3. **Cost Condition:** The cost per attended class should be $10 or less for Manny to continue these classes.\n\nWe'll calculate the cost per attended class based on the number of classes Manny actually attends (let's denote this by \\( x \\)).\n\nThe **cost per attended class** is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per attended class} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Number of Attended Classes}} = \\frac{60}{x}\n\\]\n\nWe need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), solve the inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{x} \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( x \\) (assuming \\( x > 0 \\)):\n\\[\n60 \\leq 10x\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 10 to isolate \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx \\geq 6\n\\]\n\nThis means Manny needs to attend at least 6 classes to meet the cost condition. Since there are 10 classes in total, the number of classes Manny can miss is:\n\\[\n\\text{Classes he can miss} = 10 - x = 10 - 6 = 4\n\\]\n\nThe maximum number of Karate classes he can miss is therefore 4.\n\nLet's summarize and verify:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. If Manny attends exactly 6 classes, then the cost per class is:\n   \\(\\frac{60}{6} = 10\\), which is exactly $10 per class.\n\n2. If Manny attends fewer than 6 classes (e.g., 5 classes):\n   \\(\\frac{60}{5} = 12\\), which is more than $10 per class. Therefore, attending fewer than 6 classes violates the condition.\n\n3. If Manny attends more than 6 classes (e.g., 7 classes):\n   \\(\\frac{60}{7} \\approx 8.57\\), which is less than $10 per class and acceptable.\n\nSince the calculation and logic checks out, we have our final result:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
