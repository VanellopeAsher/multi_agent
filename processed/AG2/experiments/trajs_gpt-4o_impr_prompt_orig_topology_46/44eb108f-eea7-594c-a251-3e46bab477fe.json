Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces certain inches long. At last she obtains 8 pieces, then how many inches was each piece?"

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the length in inches of each of the 8 pieces Tracy cut from a 4-foot wire.\n\nApproach:\n- First, convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches.\n- Then, divide the total length in inches by the number of pieces (8) to find the length of each piece.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Convert Feet to Inches:**\n   - Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to \\(4 \\times 12\\) inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the Length of Each Piece:**\n   - Divide the total number of inches by the number of pieces (8) to find the length of each piece of wire.\n\nHere's the calculation in Python using the given format:\n\n```python\n# Convert 4 feet to inches\ntotal_length_inches = 4 * 12\n\n# Number of pieces\nnumber_of_pieces = 8\n\n# Length of each piece\nlength_per_piece = total_length_inches / number_of_pieces\n\n# Output the length of each piece\nprint(length_per_piece)\n```\n\nNow, let's proceed to verify and present the solution.\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Convert Feet to Inches:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\frac{\\text{inches}}{\\text{foot}} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Length of Each Piece:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{48 \\text{ inches}}{8 \\text{ pieces}} = 6 \\text{ inches per piece}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct, and each piece of wire is 6 inches long.\n\nThus, the length of each piece is \\( \\boxed{6} \\)."
