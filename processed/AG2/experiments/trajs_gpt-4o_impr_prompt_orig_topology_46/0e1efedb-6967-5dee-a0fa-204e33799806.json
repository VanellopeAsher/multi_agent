      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a gardening store, my mother purchased a collection of pots priced at $19 and a bag of garden soil costing $26. She utilized a discount voucher that reduced her total by $7. What was the total amount of money my mother expended at the gardening store?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money spent after applying the discount. Let's proceed by following the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Cost Before Discount:**\n   - Cost of pots: $19\n   - Cost of garden soil: $26\n   - The total cost before the discount is the sum of these two amounts.\n\n2. **Apply the Discount:**\n   - The discount applied is $7.\n   - Subtract the discount from the total cost calculated before.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Expenditure:**\n   - This will give us the total amount of money expended after applying the discount.\n\nLet's use Python to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Total cost before the discount\ncost_of_pots = 19\ncost_of_soil = 26\ntotal_cost_before_discount = cost_of_pots + cost_of_soil\n\n# Discount value\ndiscount = 7\n\n# Total expenditure after applying the discount\ntotal_expenditure = total_cost_before_discount - discount\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_expenditure)\n```\n\nNow, let's go through the VERIFICATION step:\n\n1. **Recalculate the Total Cost Before the Discount:**\n   - \\( 19 + 26 = 45 \\)\n\n2. **Recalculate the Total Expenditure After the Discount:**\n   - \\( 45 - 7 = 38 \\)\n\nSince both calculations align with our expectations and logic, we can be confident in the answer.\n\nThus, the total amount of money my mother expended at the gardening store is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{38}\\)"
