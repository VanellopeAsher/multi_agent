Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for a period of time, during which he lost 10 pounds per month.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's adopt Case 1: Direct Python Solution. We'll determine the initial weight by considering the weight loss over a period of time.\n\n### Key Idea:\n\nMark lost 10 pounds per month, and we know his final weight was 70 pounds. If we denote his initial weight as \\( W_{\\text{initial}} \\) and the time duration he was unwell as \\( t \\) months, the relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{initial}} - 10t = 70 \\]\n\nTo proceed, we need either the duration \\( t \\) or any additional condition that could help us, as the given problem is currently underdetermined without \\( t \\).\n\n### Approach:\n\n- If \\( t \\) (the period in months) is provided, substitute the value of \\( t \\) into the equation and solve for \\( W_{\\text{initial}} \\).\n- If not, we return an indication that more data is needed.\n\nAssuming \\( t \\) is missing based on the problem statement:\n\n```python\n# Missing data scenario\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nW_initial, t = symbols('W_initial t')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(W_initial - 10*t, 70)\n\n# Output the formatted solution\nprint(r'More data needed: t is unknown, therefore answer is:', '\\boxed{None}')\n```\n\nSince the problem does not specify the number of months \\( t \\), our solution signals that further information is required to proceed definitively:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{None}}\n\\]\n\nHowever, if we had a specific duration, we could substitute it to solve for the initial weight.
