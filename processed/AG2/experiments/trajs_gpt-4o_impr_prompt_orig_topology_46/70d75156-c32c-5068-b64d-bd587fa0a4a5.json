      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMrs. Harrington bought several boxes of oranges at the market. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Then she kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest. How many oranges did Mrs. Harrington sell if each box contains 20 oranges?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold after redistributing the boxes and keeping a portion.\n\n1. **Identify Initial Ownership and Distribution:**\n   - Mrs. Harrington initially bought several boxes of oranges.\n   - She gave away 2 boxes each to her mom and sister, totaling 4 boxes given away.\n   - Each box contains 20 oranges.\n\nLet's define the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Remaining Oranges:**\n   - After giving away 4 boxes, Mrs. Harrington has \\( x - 4 \\) boxes left.\n   - Total oranges remaining with her: \\( 20 \\times (x - 4) \\).\n\n3. **Apply the Fraction for Keeping:**\n   - Mrs. Harrington kept \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining oranges.\n   - Oranges kept: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 \\times (x - 4)\\).\n\n4. **Compute Oranges Sold:**\n   - Oranges sold: Total remaining oranges - Oranges she kept.\n   - Oranges sold: \\( 20 \\times (x - 4) - \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 \\times (x - 4) \\).\n\n5. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   - Oranges sold: \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 \\times (x - 4)\\).\n   - Oranges sold: \\( 15 \\times (x - 4)\\).\n\nFrom the problem statement, it seems we do not have the number of boxes \\( x \\) Mrs. Harrington initially bought. Therefore, with the current information, we can formulate the number of oranges sold in terms of \\( x \\):\n\nThe expression for oranges sold is \\( 15(x - 4) \\).\n\nSince the initial number of boxes \\( x \\) wasn't given, the problem appears to be lacking sufficient data. Using the formalism provided for such cases:\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{None}}\\)\n\nIf additional information about the total number of boxes initially purchased is available, we can substitute that into the expression to calculate the exact number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold."
