      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday.

      "content": "To calculate Judy's earnings in one week from teaching dance classes, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of classes per week:**\n   - Judy teaches 5 classes per day from Monday to Friday. \n   - She teaches 8 classes on Saturday. \n   - She doesn't teach on Sunday.\n   \n   Total classes in a week = (5 classes/day * 5 days) + 8 classes = 25 + 8 = 33 classes.\n\n2. **Determine the number of students per class:**\n   - Each class has 15 students.\n\n3. **Calculate revenue per student per class:**\n   - Judy charges $15.00 per student for each class.\n\n4. **Compute the total weekly earnings:**\n   - Earnings per class = 15 students * $15 = $225\n   - Total earnings in a week = 33 classes * $225 earnings per class\n\nUsing these steps, let's calculate the total earnings.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary library (although not required here, as we're not using advanced math features)\n# from sympy import *\n\n# Constants\nclasses_per_week = 33  # 25 (Mon-Fri) + 8 (Sat)\nstudents_per_class = 15\ncharge_per_student = 15\n\n# Calculating weekly earnings\nearnings_per_class = students_per_class * charge_per_student\nweekly_earnings = classes_per_week * earnings_per_class\n\n# Output the result\nprint(weekly_earnings)\n```\n\nLet's calculate the result now:\n\n- Earnings per class: 15 * $15 = $225\n- Total weekly earnings: 33 * $225 = $7425\n\nThus, Judy makes $7425 in one week."

Let's present the solution and verify it formally:\n\n### VERIFICATION\n\n1. **Classes per Week:**\n   - 5 days a week from Monday to Friday, 5 classes per day: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) classes.\n   - 8 classes on Saturday: Total \\(25 + 8 = 33\\) classes weekly.\n\n2. **Earnings Calculation:**\n   - Earnings per class: \\(15 \\text{ students} \\times \\$15/\\text{student} = \\$225\\)\n   - Total weekly earnings: \\(33 \\text{ classes} \\times \\$225/\\text{class} = \\$7425\\)\n\nBoth steps align with the provided problem statement, and the calculations are consistent.
