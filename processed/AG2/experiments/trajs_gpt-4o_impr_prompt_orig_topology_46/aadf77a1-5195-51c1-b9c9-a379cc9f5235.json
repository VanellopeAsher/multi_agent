Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a straightforward approach (Case 1: Direct Python Solution). We need to calculate the total area covered by the medium and large t-shirts and then determine how many small t-shirts are needed to reach the total quilt area of 101 square feet.\n\nLet's define the problem clearly:\n\n1. Octavia has used:\n   - 8 medium t-shirts, with each covering 4 square feet.\n   - 6 large t-shirts, with each covering 6 square feet.\n\n2. Total area of the quilt is 101 square feet.\n\nLet's calculate how many small t-shirts are needed.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the unknown variable\ns = symbols('s')  # number of small t-shirts\n\n# Given data\narea_medium = 8 * 4  # 8 medium t-shirts, each 4 square feet\narea_large = 6 * 6   # 6 large t-shirts, each 6 square feet\ntotal_area = 101      # total area of the quilt\n\n# Equation representing the total area with small t-shirts\nequation = Eq(area_medium + area_large + 3 * s, total_area)\n\n# Solve for the number of small t-shirts\nnumber_of_small_tshirts = solve(equation, s)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_small_tshirts)\n```\n\nNow, let's go through the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the area covered by medium t-shirts**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area by medium t-shirts} = 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area covered by large t-shirts**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area by large t-shirts} = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total area covered by medium and large t-shirts so far**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area so far} = 32 + 36 = 68 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total quilt area required**: 101 square feet.\n\n5. **Calculate remaining area that needs to be covered by small t-shirts**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining Area} = 101 - 68 = 33 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the number of small t-shirts needed**:  \n   Each small t-shirt covers 3 square feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of small t-shirts} = \\frac{33}{3} = 11\n   \\]\n\nThus, Octavia used \\(\\boxed{11}\\) small t-shirts for the quilt."
