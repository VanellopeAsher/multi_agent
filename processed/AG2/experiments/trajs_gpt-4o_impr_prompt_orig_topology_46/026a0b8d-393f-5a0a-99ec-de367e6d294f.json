Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought. We know from the problem that:\n\n- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.\n- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.\n- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n- She spent a total of $3200 on all the seeds.\n\nLet's set up an equation to solve for the number of tomato seed packets.\n\n**Conceptualizing the Problem:**\n\n1. Let \\( t \\) represent the number of tomato seed packets.\n2. The cost of \\( t \\) packets of tomato seeds is \\( 40t \\).\n3. The cost of 80 packets of celery seeds is \\( 80 \\times 30 = 2400 \\).\n4. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tomato seeds and celery seeds, which equals $3200.\n\nWe can express this in equation form:\n\\[\n40t + 2400 = 3200\n\\]\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\nWe will solve this linear equation for \\( t \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nt = symbols('t')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(40*t + 2400, 3200)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, t)\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(\"Number of tomato packets:\", solution[0])\n```\n\n**Explanation and Solution:**\n\n1. Subtract 2400 from both sides to isolate the term involving \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   40t = 3200 - 2400\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   40t = 800\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 40 to solve for \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{800}{40} = 20\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet's verify:\n\n- Total cost of tomato seeds = \\( 20 \\times 40 = 800 \\).\n- Total cost of celery seeds = \\( 80 \\times 30 = 2400 \\).\n- Total cost = \\( 800 + 2400 = 3200 \\), which matches the total amount spent.\n\nGiven this verification, the solution appears correct.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\(\\boxed{20}\\)"
