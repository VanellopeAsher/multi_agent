Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGerald works at a daycare that pays him $300 every day. He worked for an entire week and spent a total of $1000. How much does he have left?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down by calculating Gerald's earnings and his expenses, and then finding out the remaining amount he has.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate Gerald's Earnings:**\n   - Gerald earns $300 per day.\n   - Assume he works 7 days a week since it states \"an entire week.\"\n   - Total earnings for one week = $300/day * 7 days.\n\n2. **Subtract Expenses:**\n   - Gerald spent $1000 during the week.\n   - Remaining amount = Total earnings - Expenses.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Gerald's earnings per day\ndaily_earnings = 300\n\n# Number of days Gerald worked in a week\ndays_worked = 7\n\n# Total earnings for the week\ntotal_earnings = daily_earnings * days_worked\n\n# Total expenses\nexpenses = 1000\n\n# Remaining amount after expenses\nremaining_amount = total_earnings - expenses\n\n# Output the result\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. Gerald's earnings for 7 days are calculated as \\(300 \\times 7 = 2100\\).\n2. Subtracting the $1000 he spent from his earnings of $2100, gives him $1100 left.\n3. The result makes sense as per the calculations and assumptions outlined.\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\\(\\boxed{1100}\\)"

Based on the problem statement and the calculations we've walked through:\n\nGerald earns $300 per day and works for 7 days in a week. So his total weekly earnings would be:\n\\[ 300 \\times 7 = 2100 \\]\n\nHe spends $1000 during the week, so the amount he has left after his expenses is:\n\\[ 2100 - 1000 = 1100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Gerald has left at the end of the week is:\n\\(\\boxed{1100}\\)"
