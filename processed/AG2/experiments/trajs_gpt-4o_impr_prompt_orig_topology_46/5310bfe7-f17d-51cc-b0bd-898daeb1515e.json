Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThree teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 30 more goals than Mark and scored 55 more goals than Anna. If Richie scored 90 goals, how many goals did all three teenagers score?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow a reasoning-based approach since the problem can be easily tackled through setting up equations based on the given conditions.\n\n**Problem Solving Approach:**\n\nWe know:\n\n1. Richie scored 90 goals.\n2. Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n3. Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\nWe need to calculate the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna and then find the total goals scored by all three teenagers.\n\n**Step-by-Step Process:**\n\n1. **Setup Equations:**\n    - Let \\( M \\) be the number of goals scored by Mark.\n    - Let \\( A \\) be the number of goals scored by Anna.\n    - Richie scored 90 goals, so, \\( R = 90 \\).\n\n   From the problem statement, we have the following equations:\n   \\[\n   R = M + 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   R = A + 55\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( R = 90 \\), substitute this into the equations:\n   \\[\n   90 = M + 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   90 = A + 55\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve the Equations:**\n\n   \\[\n   M = 90 - 30 = 60\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   A = 90 - 55 = 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute Total Goals:**\n\n   The total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Goals} = R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n\n   Let's calculate the total using Python for clarity and verification:\n   ```python\n   # Calculate the total goals\n   R = 90\n   M = 90 - 30\n   A = 90 - 55\n   total_goals = R + M + A\n\n   # Print the result\n   print(total_goals)\n   ```\n\nNow, let's verify the calculation.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\n- Richie scored 90, which aligns with the given data.\n- Mark's calculation \\( M = 60 \\) checks out since \\( 60 + 30 = 90 \\).\n- Anna's calculation \\( A = 35 \\) also checks out since \\( 35 + 55 = 90 \\).\n- The total calculation: \\( 90 + 60 + 35 = 185 \\).\n\nThe verification is consistent with the problem requirements and conditions.\n\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \\(\\boxed{185}\\)."
