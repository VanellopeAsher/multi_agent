Given that their total age is 162, we have:\n    \\[\n    7x + 11x = 162\n    \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\)**:\n    \\[\n    18x = 162\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{162}{18} = 9\n    \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Darrell's and Allen's current ages**:\n   - Darrell's age: \\(7x = 7 \\times 9 = 63\\)\n   - Allen's age: \\(11x = 11 \\times 9 = 99\\)\n\n4. **Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Allen's age now} = 99\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 99 + 10 = 109\n   \\]\n\nThrough these steps, we find that Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109. Let's discuss this solution with the rest of the agents to confirm its validity."
