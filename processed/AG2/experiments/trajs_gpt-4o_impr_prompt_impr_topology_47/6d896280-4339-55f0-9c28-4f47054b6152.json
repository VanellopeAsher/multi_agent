      "content": "To solve this problem, let's use a systematic approach with algebraic equations:\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:  \n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.  \n   - Since the number made on Wednesday is the same as Tuesday, it is also \\( x \\).  \n   - The number made on Friday is twice the amount made on Tuesday, so it's \\( 2x \\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:  \n   According to the problem, the total number of chimichangas made across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation as:  \n   \\[\n   x + x + 2x = 500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**:  \n   Simplify the equation by combining like terms:  \n   \\[\n   4x = 500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:  \n   Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday is 125. \n\nNow, let's discuss and confirm this solution with the team."
