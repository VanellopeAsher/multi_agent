She gives Jayden half of it:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ava's contribution} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Funds Jayden Has**: Jayden has $70 from selling pictures and an additional $45 from Ava:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total funds} = 70 + 45 = 115\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine How Much More Jayden Needs**: Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera, implying that the cost of the camera must be the total funds plus the additional amount needed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the camera} = 115 + 85 = 200\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the camera is $200."
