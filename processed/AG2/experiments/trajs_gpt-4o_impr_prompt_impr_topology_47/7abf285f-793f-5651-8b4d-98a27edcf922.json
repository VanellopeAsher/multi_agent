Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month.

      "content": "To determine how much Jessica spends on her debts in a year, we need to calculate her monthly debt payments and then extrapolate to an annual figure. Let's go step-by-step through this process:\n\n1. **Identify the Minimum Monthly Payments for Each Debt:**\n   - **Student Loans**: $300/month\n   - **Credit Card**: $200/month\n   - **Mortgage**: $500/month\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Minimum Monthly Payment for Debts:**\n   - Total Minimum Payment = $300 (Student Loans) + $200 (Credit Card) + $500 (Mortgage) = $1000/month\n\n3. **Calculate 50% More than the Minimum for Debts:**\n   - 50% increase on Total Minimum Payment = 0.5 * $1000 = $500\n   - Total Monthly Payment Including Bonus = $1000 (Minimum) + $500 (50% More) = $1500/month\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Annual Payment for Debts:**\n   - Annual Debt Payment = $1500/month * 12 months = $18,000/year\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays $18,000 per year on her debts, considering she is paying 50% more than the minimum required each month. This does not include Netflix or gym payments as theyâ€™re non-debt related in this context. \n\nLet's engage in a discussion with the other agents to ensure accuracy and explore any improvements or insights."

My role now is to execute the plan using Python, verifying the detailed steps with concrete calculations to ensure there are no errors. \n\nHere's what I'll do:\n\n1. Define variables for the minimum monthly payments of each debt.\n2. Sum these to get the total monthly debt payment.\n3. Calculate the 50% increase Jessica wants to apply.\n4. Compute the total monthly payment including the 50% more.\n5. Finally, calculate the total annual payment by multiplying by 12 months.\n\nNow, let's code this:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the minimum payments\nstudent_loan_payment = 300\ncredit_card_payment = 200\nmortgage_payment = 500\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total minimum monthly debt payment\ntotal_minimum_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Step 3: Calculate 50% increase\nincrease_percentage = 0.50\nextra_payment = total_minimum_monthly_payment * increase_percentage\n\n# Step 4: Total monthly payment including 50% more\ntotal_monthly_payment = total_minimum_monthly_payment + extra_payment\n\n# Step 5: Annual payment\nannual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the annual payment\nprint(annual_payment)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

This calculation was made by determining her monthly payments and then extrapolating to an annual figure, considering she pays 50% more than the minimum requirement on her debts.\n\nThe solution accounts only for her debts and excludes non-debt-related expenses like Netflix and gym subscriptions, which are not part of the debt payment calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final verified solution for the total annual debt payment is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{18000}**"
