      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**\n   - William bought five notebooks, each costing $1.50.\n   - The total cost for the notebooks is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the ballpen:**\n   - William bought one ballpen costing $0.50.\n   - The total cost for the ballpen is:\n     \\[\n     0.50 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the pencil case:**\n   - The pencil case costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens.\n   - First, calculate the cost of one notebook and two ballpens:\n     \\[\n     1.50 + 2 \\times 0.50 = 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the cost of the pencil case is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount William spent:**\n   - Add up the costs of the notebooks, ballpen, and pencil case:\n     \\[\n     7.50 + 0.50 + 5.00 = 13.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, William spent a total of $13.00. \n\nNow, let's engage in a discussion to see if there's any other step or clarification needed."
