On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold from Saturday to Monday and then calculate the total earnings based on the prices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Saturday's Sales:**\n   - Gingerbread: Sunny sold 10 boxes.\n   - Apple Pie: Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday (let's denote the boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday as \\( y \\)). So, on Saturday, he sold \\( y - 4 \\) boxes.\n\n2. **Sunday's Sales:**\n   - Gingerbread: On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more gingerbread boxes than on Saturday. Therefore, he sold \\( 10 + 5 = 15 \\) boxes.\n   - Apple Pie: He sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, so \\( y = 15 \\).\n\n3. **Monday's Sales:**\n   - Gingerbread: Sunny sold 2 boxes.\n   - Apple Pie: He sold 4 boxes.\n\n4. **Sales Breakdown:**\n   - On Saturday:\n     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes\n     - Apple Pie: \\( 15 - 4 = 11 \\) boxes\n   - On Sunday:\n     - Gingerbread: 15 boxes\n     - Apple Pie: 15 boxes\n   - On Monday:\n     - Gingerbread: 2 boxes\n     - Apple Pie: 4 boxes\n\n5. **Total Earnings Calculation:**\n   - Gingerbread earnings: Total boxes sold = \\( 10 + 15 + 2 = 27 \\) boxes.\n     - Total earnings from gingerbread = \\( 27 \\times 6 = 162 \\) dollars.\n   - Apple Pie earnings: Total boxes sold = \\( 11 + 15 + 4 = 30 \\) boxes.\n     - Total earnings from apple pie = \\( 30 \\times 15 = 450 \\) dollars.\n\n6. **Total Earnings for Three Days:**\n   - Total earnings = Gingerbread earnings + Apple Pie earnings\n   - Total earnings = \\( 162 + 450 = 612 \\) dollars.\n\nThus, Sunny earned a total of $612 over the three days from selling gingerbread and apple pie. \n\nNow, let's discuss this step-by-step solution among agents for any potential improvements or suggestions."
