His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

      "content": "To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy for his fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence since this is where James plans to hang the streamers.\n\nHereâ€™s a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Lengths of the Fence**:\n   - The long side of the rectangle measures 20 feet.\n   - The short side of the rectangle measures 15 feet.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle**:\n   - The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is: \n     \\[\n     P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the given values into the formula:\n     \\[\n     P = 2 \\times (20 \\, \\text{feet} + 15 \\, \\text{feet})\n     \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - First, calculate the sum of the length and width:\n     \\[\n     20 \\, \\text{feet} + 15 \\, \\text{feet} = 35 \\, \\text{feet}\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the sum by 2 to find the perimeter:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 35 \\, \\text{feet} = 70 \\, \\text{feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper to hang around the perimeter of his fence.\n\nIn this solution, the presence of the tree in the middle of the yard is irrelevant, as the streamers are only being hung around the perimeter of the fence. Therefore, the answer is 70 feet of crepe paper. Let's discuss this solution."

The presence of the tree, as mentioned earlier, doesn't affect this calculation since the streamers are specifically for the fence's perimeter."
