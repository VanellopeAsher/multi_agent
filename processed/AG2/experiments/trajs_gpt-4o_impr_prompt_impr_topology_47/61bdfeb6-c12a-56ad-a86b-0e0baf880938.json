      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many OLED TVs were sold by calculating the proportion of each type of TV sold and then subtracting these from the total number of TVs sold (which is 40).\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Fraction of Smart TVs:** One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs. Therefore, the number of smart TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10 \\).\n\n2. **Fraction of Analog TVs:** One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs. Therefore, the number of analog TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times 40 = 5 \\).\n\n3. **Fraction of Projection TVs:** One-fifth of the sales are projection TVs. Therefore, the number of projection TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 40 = 8 \\).\n\n4. **Total TVs Sold:** We subtract the number of smart, analog, and projection TVs sold from the total number of 40 TVs, to find the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of OLED TVs sold} = 40 - (10 + 5 + 8)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of OLED TVs sold} = 40 - 23 = 17\n   \\]\n\nThus, Samwell was able to sell 17 OLED TVs."
