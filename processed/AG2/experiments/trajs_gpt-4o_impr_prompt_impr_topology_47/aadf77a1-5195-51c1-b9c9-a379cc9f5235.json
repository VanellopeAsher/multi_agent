      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of small t-shirts used by Octavia to complete the quilt.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the number of small t-shirts Octavia used.\n   - We know she used 8 medium t-shirts and 6 large t-shirts.\n\n2. **Understand the Fabric Contribution:**\n   - Each small t-shirt contributes 3 square feet of fabric.\n   - Each medium t-shirt contributes 4 square feet of fabric.\n   - Each large t-shirt contributes 6 square feet of fabric.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - The total area of the quilt is 101 square feet.\n   - Therefore, the equation for the total area using all shirts is:\n     \\[\n     3S + 4 \\times 8 + 6 \\times 6 = 101\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Known Contributions:**\n   - Medium shirts contribute: \\( 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\) square feet.\n   - Large shirts contribute: \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\) square feet.\n\n5. **Substitute and Solve for \\( S \\):**\n   - Substitute the known contributions into the equation:\n     \\[\n     3S + 32 + 36 = 101\n     \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     3S + 68 = 101\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 68 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     3S = 33\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 3:\n     \\[\n     S = 11\n     \\]\n\nThus, Octavia used 11 small t-shirts to make the quilt. \n\nNow, I will discuss this solution with the other agents to confirm its validity."
