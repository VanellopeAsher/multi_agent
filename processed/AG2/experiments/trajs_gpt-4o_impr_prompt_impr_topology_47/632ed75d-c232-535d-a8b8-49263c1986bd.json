The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

      "content": "To determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France, let's systematically break down the problem.\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between Flights of the Two Aircraft:**\n   - The second aircraft flies to Poland and operates 44 flights daily. \n   - These 44 flights represent half the total flights made by the first aircraft each day.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Flights of the First Aircraft:**\n   - Let the total number of flights of the first aircraft be \\( x \\).\n   - Since 44 flights represent half of \\( x \\), we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 44 \\times 2 = 88\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the first aircraft operates a total of 88 flights daily.\n\n3. **Determine the Distribution of Flights by the First Aircraft:**\n   - Three-fourths of the flights of the first aircraft go to Greece.\n   - This means the number of flights to Greece is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flights to Greece} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n     \\]\n   - The remaining flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The remaining number of flights is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Flights} = 88 - 66 = 22\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Flights to France:**\n   - The flights to France and Germany are evenly divided, meaning the number of flights to each country is half of the remaining flights:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Flights to France} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n     \\]\n\nThus, the first aircraft makes 11 daily flights to France."
