      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam will receive if Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam, and the total fence length is 200 feet.\n\nLet \\( s \\) represent the length of the fence Sam receives. Consequently, Harry will receive \\( s + 80 \\) feet of the fence since it is specified Harry receives 80 feet more than Sam.\n\nTherefore, the equation representing the total length of the fence is:\n\n\\[\ns + (s + 80) = 200\n\\]\n\nNow, we simplify and solve for \\( s \\):\n\n1. Combine terms:\n   \\[\n   2s + 80 = 200\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract 80 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2s = 120\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   s = 60\n   \\]\n\nSo, Sam receives 60 feet of the fence. \n\nTherefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 60 feet."
