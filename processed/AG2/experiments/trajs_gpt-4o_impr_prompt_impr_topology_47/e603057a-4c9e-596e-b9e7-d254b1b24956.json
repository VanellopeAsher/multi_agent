In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Let's go through the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the current age of Seth.\n   - Let \\( B \\) be the current age of Brooke.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equations:**\n   - According to the first piece of information, Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \n     \\[ S = 2B \\]\n   - In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36:\n     \\[ (S + 3) + (B + 3) = 36 \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Second Equation:**\n   \\[ S + 3 + B + 3 = 36 \\]\n   \\[ S + B + 6 = 36 \\]\n   \\[ S + B = 30 \\]\n\n4. **Substitute and Solve:**\n   - Substitute \\( S = 2B \\) into \\( S + B = 30 \\):\n     \\[ 2B + B = 30 \\]\n     \\[ 3B = 30 \\]\n     \\[ B = 10 \\]\n\n5. **Find Seth's Age:**\n   - Substitute \\( B = 10 \\) back into \\( S = 2B \\):\n     \\[ S = 2(10) \\]\n     \\[ S = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, Seth is currently 20 years old. \n\nNow let's engage in discussion and see if Agent Code Executor arrives at the same solution or if they have another perspective."
