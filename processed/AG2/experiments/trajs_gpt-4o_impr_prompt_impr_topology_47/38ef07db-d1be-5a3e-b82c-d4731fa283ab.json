      "content": "To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. Here's how you can solve it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**\n   - Length (\\(L\\)) = 20.5 feet\n   - Width (\\(W\\)) = 15.5 feet\n\n2. **Use the Perimeter Formula for a Rectangle:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Plug in the given dimensions:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (20.5 + 15.5)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the sum inside the parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   20.5 + 15.5 = 36\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 2 to find the perimeter:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times 36 = 72\n   \\]\n\nJames needs to buy 72 feet of crepe paper to hang around the entire fence. Let me know your thoughts or if you'd like to verify or discuss further."
