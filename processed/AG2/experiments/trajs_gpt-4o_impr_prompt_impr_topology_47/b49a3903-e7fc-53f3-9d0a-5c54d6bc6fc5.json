      "content": "To determine the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to find out how many rows of each color will be planted and then sum them up, accounting for the additional rows of yellow tulips.\n\nLet's go through the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate Rows for Red Tulips**:\n   - Jackson has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 in a row.\n   - Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6 rows.\n\n2. **Calculate Rows for Blue Tulips**:\n   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 in a row.\n   - Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3 rows.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Rows for Yellow Tulips**:\n   - Jackson buys 30 yellow tulips and can fit 5 in a row.\n   - Number of rows of yellow tulips = 30 / 5 = 6 rows.\n\n4. **Total Rows of Mixed Tulips**:\n   - Rows of yellow tulips are placed between each red and blue row.\n   - There are 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips, so there will be 6 additional rows of yellow tulips (since each row of other colors will get a yellow row following it).\n\n5. **Calculate Total Rows**:\n   - Total rows = rows of red tulips + rows of blue tulips + rows of yellow tulips\n   - Total rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 6 (yellow) = 15 rows.\n\nThus, Jackson will plant a total of 15 rows of flowers."

Jackson plants 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.\n2. Jackson buys 30 yellow tulips, allowing him to plant 6 rows of yellow tulips.\n\nThe original solution had miscalculated the placement of yellow rows. The correct placement of yellow rows is between each red and blue row as additional ones, but since Jackson uses all his yellow tulips to create 6 separate rows, the previous interpretation stands that he adds to the count of non-yellow rows, resulting in a yet consistent total but affirming design.\n\nTherefore, the total number of rows Jackson will actually plant is just the sum of red, blue, and yellow rows, without adding them as separators since the totality was used exclusively, equaling 15 rows.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{15}**"
