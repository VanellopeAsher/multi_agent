  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, let's break down the weights of each type of feed and calculate the total weight. Then, we'll divide by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Weight for Each Type of Feed**:\n   - **Sugar cubes**: The farmer buys 20 boxes, each weighing 10 pounds. \n     \\[\n     20 \\times 10 = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Carrots**: The farmer buys 40 bags, each weighing 120 pounds.\n     \\[\n     40 \\times 120 = 4800 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Hay**: The farmer buys 420 bales, each weighing 750 pounds.\n     \\[\n     420 \\times 750 = 315000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Oats**: The farmer buys 200 sacks, each weighing 650 pounds.\n     \\[\n     200 \\times 650 = 130000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Weight of All Feed**:\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ (sugar cubes)} + 4800 \\text{ (carrots)} + 315000 \\text{ (hay)} + 130000 \\text{ (oats)} = 450000 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Trips Required**:\n   - The truck can carry 22500 pounds per trip. To find the number of trips, divide the total weight by the carrying capacity of the truck.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{450000}{22500} = 20 \\text{ trips}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to make 20 trips to transport all the feed. \n\nDiscussion with others is welcome to ensure accuracy and completeness."
