He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's systematically document the information given and the calculations needed:\n\n1. Elliott's daily goal is to walk 10,000 steps.\n2. He completed half of these steps going to and from school. Therefore, the steps taken around school = 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.\n3. Elliott walked 1,000 steps with his friend.\n4. He also walked 500 steps shopping.\n5. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.\n\nLet's calculate the number of steps Elliott completed before his jog:\n\n- Steps going to and from school: 5,000 steps\n- Steps with his friend: 1,000 steps\n- Steps going shopping: 500 steps\n\nTotal steps before jogging = 5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500 steps.\n\nNow, we can calculate how many steps he had already taken after his jog:\n\n- Elliott's total goal of steps: 10,000 steps\n- Steps left after the jog: 2,000 steps\n\nSteps taken before jog + steps taken during jog + steps left = Total goal\n\n6,500 (steps before jog) + steps during jog + 2,000 (steps left) = 10,000\nSteps during jog = 10,000 - 6,500 - 2,000 = 1,500 steps\n\nTherefore, Elliott took 1,500 steps during his jog. Let's discuss this to ensure clarity or any adjustments needed."
