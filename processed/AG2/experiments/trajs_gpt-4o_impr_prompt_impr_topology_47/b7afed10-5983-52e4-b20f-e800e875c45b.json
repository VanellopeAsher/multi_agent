In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Thus, for these three days:\n   \\[\n   3.5 \\, \\text{miles per day} \\times 3 \\, \\text{days} = 10.5 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. Sam ran 5.5 miles on each of Tuesday and Thursday. Thus, for these two days:\n   \\[\n   5.5 \\, \\text{miles per day} \\times 2 \\, \\text{days} = 11 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. To find the total miles run over the week, we sum the miles from the two groups above:\n   \\[\n   10.5 \\, \\text{miles} + 11 \\, \\text{miles} = 21.5 \\, \\text{miles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Sam ran a total of 21.5 miles over the course of the week. \nAfter performing these calculations, let's discuss to ensure the solution is thorough and correct."
