The dimensions of the fabric needed for each side of the comforter are 8 feet by 10 feet, given the bed is increased by 2 feet in both dimensions.\n2. The area required for two pieces for the comforter is \\(2 \\times (8 \\times 10) = 160\\) square feet.\n3. The dimensions of the duvet cover are 9 feet by 11 feet, leading to an area of \\(9 \\times 11 = 99\\) square feet.\n4. Therefore, the total fabric needed is \\(160 + 99 = 259\\) square feet.\n\nBoth approaches corroborate the same final answer. I confirm that the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{259}**"
