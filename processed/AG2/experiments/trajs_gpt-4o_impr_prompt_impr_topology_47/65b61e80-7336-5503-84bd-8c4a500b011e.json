      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Information**:\n   - There are two Smith twins and each found 30 eggs. So, together they found:\n     \\[\n     30 + 30 = 60 \\text{ eggs}\n     \\]\n   - The problem states that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of eggs found by the friends.\n   - According to the problem, the total number of eggs, excluding the 10 not found, is:\n     \\[\n     x + 60\n     \\]\n   - The phrase \"all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends\" suggests that these 10 are part of the total found with the twins, and not found by the friends.\n\n3. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   - Thus, we can say:\n     \\[\n     x + 60 = N\n     \\]\n     Where \\( N \\) is the total number of eggs, which includes those not found.\n   \n4. **Determine Total Eggs**:\n   - Since no additional information is provided about total eggs, interpret that \"except 10\" means the remaining were found by friends. Re-apply:\n     \\[\n     x = 10 \\text{ (unfound) + found eggs by friends}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Understanding that the rest except 10 means the eggs found by the twins aren't countedâ€”it checks itself.\n   - Therefore, if they found 60, then simply needing total eggs to validate means friends found:\n     \\[\n     N - 60 - 10 = x\n     \\]\n   - \\( x = 50 \\).\n\nThus, the friends found 50 eggs."
