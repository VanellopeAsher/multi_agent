      "content": "To solve the problem of calculating the total amount of TV Frankie watched during the weekdays, we should break down his viewing hours for each day and sum them.\n\nLet's go through each day:\n\n- **Monday**: Frankie watches a 1-hour episode.\n- **Tuesday**: Another 1-hour episode.\n- **Wednesday**: Three 30-minute episodes. That equals \\(3 \\times 0.5\\) hours = 1.5 hours.\n- **Thursday**: An hour episode and a 30-minute show. So, 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n- **Friday**: Two one-hour episodes. That equals \\(2 \\times 1\\) hour = 2 hours.\n\nNow, we just add up the hours from each day:\n\n\\[ 1 \\, (\\text{Monday}) + 1 \\, (\\text{Tuesday}) + 1.5 \\, (\\text{Wednesday}) + 1.5 \\, (\\text{Thursday}) + 2 \\, (\\text{Friday}) \\]\n\nThat results in:\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV over the week."
