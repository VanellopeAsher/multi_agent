Since Marty has a total length of 10,000 millimeters of ribbon to be cut into 40 parts, each part should indeed be \\(\\frac{10,000}{40} = 250\\) millimeters long.\n\n2. He will then split each of those 250-millimeter parts into 50 smaller parts. Each of these final cuts is \\(\\frac{250}{50} = 5\\) millimeters long.\n\nBased on these steps, the solution seems correct. \n\nI will now write a Python code to confirm this calculation.
