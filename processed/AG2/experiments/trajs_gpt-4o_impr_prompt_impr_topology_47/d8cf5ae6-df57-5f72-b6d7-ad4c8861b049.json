  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

      "content": "To determine how many pounds the farm truck can carry at a time, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and then divide it by 2 (since the farmer needs to transport the feed in 2 trips).\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Sugar Cubes**: \n   - Two 1-pound boxes\n   - Total weight = 2 boxes × 1 pound/box = 2 pounds\n\n2. **Carrots**:\n   - Four 12-pound bags\n   - Total weight = 4 bags × 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds\n\n3. **Hay**:\n   - Forty-two 75-pound bales\n   - Total weight = 42 bales × 75 pounds/bale = 3,150 pounds\n\n4. **Oats**:\n   - Twenty 65-pound sacks\n   - Total weight = 20 sacks × 65 pounds/sack = 1,300 pounds\n\nNext, sum up the weights of all these items to find the total weight:\n\n- Total weight = Sugar Cubes + Carrots + Hay + Oats\n- Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3,150 pounds + 1,300 pounds\n- Total weight = 4,500 pounds\n\nSince the farmer needs to transport all the feed in 2 trips, we divide the total weight by 2 to find out how many pounds the farm truck can carry at a time:\n\n- Pounds per trip = Total weight / 2\n- Pounds per trip = 4,500 pounds / 2\n- Pounds per trip = 2,250 pounds\n\nTherefore, the farm truck can carry 2,250 pounds at a time. Let's proceed to the discussion phase to see if there's agreement on this solution."
