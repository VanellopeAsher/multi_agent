Agent Problem Solver's breakdown:\n   - First 6 months at $200/month: Total = $1,200.\n   - Last 6 months at $170/month (15% discount applied): Total = $1,020.\n   - Total payment for the year = $1,200 + $1,020 = $2,220.\n\n2. Agent Code Executor confirmed this through Python code:\n   - Code output confirms total payment: $2,220.\n\nBoth approaches are aligned with the problem statement, as they appropriately apply the discount and calculate accordingly for each period of the year.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2220}**"
