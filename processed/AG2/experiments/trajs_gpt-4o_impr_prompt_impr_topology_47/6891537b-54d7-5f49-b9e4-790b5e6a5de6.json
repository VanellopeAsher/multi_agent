      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of basketball cards**:  \n   Miss Maria has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total basketball cards} = 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of baseball cards**:  \n   Miss Maria has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total baseball cards} = 5 \\times 40 = 200 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the total number of cards Miss Maria has**:  \n   Add the number of basketball cards and baseball cards together.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cards} = 150 + 200 = 350 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many cards Miss Maria gave away**:  \n   Since Jane refused the 10 cards, those cards remain with Miss Maria. She decided to keep 50 cards for herself.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cards remaining} = 350 - 50 = 300 \\text{ cards} \n   \\] \n\n5. **Calculate the number of students**:  \n   Miss Maria gives the remaining cards to her students, with each student receiving 10 cards.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students} = \\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
