      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students at the grade level. Let's denote the total number of students by \\( N \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer at home. This implies that one-third of the students do not have a desktop computer.\n\nWe are also given that 30 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, the one-third of students that do not have desktop computers is equal to 30. We can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times N = 30\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( N \\), simply multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\nN = 30 \\times 3 = 90\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 90 students at that grade level. \n\nI will now discuss this solution with the other agents."
