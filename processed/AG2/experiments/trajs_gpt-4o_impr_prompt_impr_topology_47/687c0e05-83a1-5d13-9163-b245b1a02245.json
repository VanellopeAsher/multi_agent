Thus:\n   \\[\n   y = 9 \\times 3 = 27\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find Remaining Unicorns Outside Scotland**:\n   Finally, subtract the number of Scottish unicorns from the total number of unicorns:\n   \\[\n   27 - 9 = 18\n   \\]\n\nThus, there are 18 unicorns left in the world outside of Scotland."

Determine the total number of Scottish unicorns through the given female unicorn count and proportion of females.\n2.
