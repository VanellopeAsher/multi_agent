      "content": "Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the variables**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the amount of the first medicine in one dose.\n   - Since Saanvi combines 3 times that amount for the second medicine, the second medicine will be \\( 3x \\) mL per dose.\n\n2. **Expression for one dose**:\n   - The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines, which is \\( x + 3x = 4x \\) mL.\n\n3. **Relate the dose information to the total**:\n   - We are told that 448 mL constitutes 8 doses. Thus, the total amount for these doses is expressed as \\( 8 \\times 4x = 448 \\) mL.\n\n4. **Set up the equation and solve**:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 4x = 448\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   32x = 448\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{448}{32}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 14\n   \\]\n\nThus, Saanvi combines 14 mL of one medicine each time for a single dose. \n\nI look forward to discussing this solution with my fellow agents."
