Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine Reggie's Distance**: \n   - Paisley ran 4 miles.\n   - Reggie ran a distance that was five times the distance Paisley ran.\n   - Therefore, Reggie ran \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) miles.\n\n2. **Use the Additional Information**:\n   - Reggie also ran 3 miles more than what Lynn ran.\n   - Therefore, if \\(L\\) is the distance Lynn ran, we can say \\(L + 3 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Solve for Lynn's Distance**:\n   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \\(L\\).\n   - \\(L = 20 - 3\\).\n   - \\(L = 17\\).\n\nSo, Lynn ran a distance of 17 miles."
