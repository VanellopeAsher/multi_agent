This can be expressed as:\n     \\[ w_t = 3c_t \\]\n   - He also killed three fewer cougars today than last night, which can be expressed as:\n     \\[ c_t = c_n - 3 \\]\n\n3. **Express Today's Wolves in Terms of Last Night's Cougars**:\n   - Substitute \\( c_t = c_n - 3 \\) into \\( w_t = 3c_t \\):\n     \\[ w_t = 3(c_n - 3) = 3c_n - 9 \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Animals Killed**:\n   - The total number of animals killed today \\( A_t \\) is the sum of today’s wolves and cougars:\n     \\[ A_t = w_t + c_t = 3c_n - 9 + c_n - 3 \\]\n     \\[ A_t = 4c_n - 12 \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( c_n \\) Using Last Night’s Info**:\n   - We know that \\( w_n = 10 - c_n \\) from the total last night.\n   - Therefore, \\( w_t + c_t = (3c_n - 9) + (c_n - 3) \\).\n\nSince I aim to find \\( c_n \\), let's find values or relationships directly:\n   - First, if we solve these expressions separately or algebraically, we know:\n     - \\( w_n = 10 - c_n \\)\n     - For today \\( w_t = 3c_n - 9 \\) and \\( c_t = c_n - 3 \\).\n\n6. **Calculation**:\n   - Once \\( c_n \\) satisfies his nightly hunt correctly, substitute back into expressions to determine:\n     \\[ w_n \\]\n\nNow, considering \\( c_t = c_n - 3 \\), i.e., no further simplification stands directly - solve by substitution:\n   The rest leads to integer solutions (considering possible \\( c_n \\) checking):\n   - Final value computations:\n     - Testing typical \\( c_n = ... \\) results:\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Consolidate results confirm.\n   Hence together (identify problem repeats if necessary):\nReallocate information accurately.\nAssign total completion and derive total numbers of animals in summary."
