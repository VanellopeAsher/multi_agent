Let \\( P \\) represent the number of cards that PJ has.\n2. Smendrick has 4 times the number of cards PJ has, so let \\( S = 4P \\).\n3. Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick, which means \\( B = S + 15 \\).\n\nGiven that the total number of cards is 447, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ P + S + B = 447 \\]\n\nNow substitute the expressions for \\( S \\) and \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ P + 4P + (4P + 15) = 447 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[ P + 4P + 4P + 15 = 447 \\]\n\n\\[ 9P + 15 = 447 \\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ 9P = 432 \\]\n\nDivide each side by 9 to solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ P = 48 \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( P \\), we can find \\( S \\) and \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ S = 4P = 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\]\n\n\\[ B = S + 15 = 192 + 15 = 207 \\]\n\nTherefore, Becca has 207 Magic cards."
