Thus, for 10 gallons, the cashback is: \\( 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$0.20/\\text{gallon} = \\$2.00 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Cost After Cashback**:\n   - Subtract the cashback from the initial total cost: \\( \\$30.00 - \\$2.00 = \\$28.00 \\).\n\n4. **Apply the 10% Discount Coupon**:\n   - The discount, 10% of the net cost after cashback (\\$28.00), is: \\( \\$28.00 \\times 0.10 = \\$2.80 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Payment**:\n   - Subtract the discount amount from the cost after cashback: \\( \\$28.00 - \\$2.80 = \\$25.20 \\).\n\nHence, the final amount paid after applying both the cashback and the coupon is $25.20.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Verifier "

Initial cost for 10 gallons at $3.00 per gallon yields a total of $30.00.\n2. The cashback of $0.20 per gallon results in a total cashback of $2.00.\n3. Subtracting the cashback from $30.00 gives a net amount of $28.00.\n4. A 10% discount on $28.00 results in a discount of $2.80.\n5. Finally, $28.00 minus the $2.80 discount results in a final payment of $25.20.\n\nBoth approaches are correct and align perfectly.
