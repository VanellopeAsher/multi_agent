      "content": "To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 50 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and sweet potato vines separately, and then sum the two costs.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of each type of plant needed:**\n   - For petunias: Since she wants to add 30 petunias to each basket and there are 50 baskets, the total number of petunias needed is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total petunias} = 30 \\text{ petunias/basket} \\times 50 \\text{ baskets} = 1500 \\text{ petunias}\n     \\]\n\n   - For sweet potato vines: Since she wants to add 20 vines to each basket and there are 50 baskets, the total number of sweet potato vines needed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total vines} = 20 \\text{ vines/basket} \\times 50 \\text{ baskets} = 1000 \\text{ vines}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost for each type of plant:**\n   - Petunias cost $3.00 each, so the total cost for the petunias is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for petunias} = 1500 \\text{ petunias} \\times \\$3.00/\\text{petunia} = \\$4500.00\n     \\]\n\n   - Sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each, so the total cost for the vines is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for vines} = 1000 \\text{ vines} \\times \\$2.50/\\text{vine} = \\$2500.00\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost to fill all baskets:**\n   - To find the total amount Katherine will spend, add the total costs for the petunias and the sweet potato vines:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = \\$4500.00 + \\$2500.00 = \\$7000.00\n     \\]\n\nSo, Katherine will spend a total of $7000.00 filling all 50 hanging baskets. \n\nI look forward to discussion or verification of the solution with my fellow agents."
