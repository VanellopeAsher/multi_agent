      "content": "To address the problem of determining how many gumballs Colby can purchase, I'll start by computing the total amount of money Colby possesses and then divide it by the cost of a single gumball.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Amount of Money Colby Has\n\nTo find out how much money Colby has in total, we need to multiply the number of each type of coin by its respective value in USD.\n\n- **Quarters**: \n  - Quantity: 8\n  - Value: $0.25 each\n  - Total from quarters = \\(8 \\times 0.25 = \\$2.00\\)\n\n- **Dimes**: \n  - Quantity: 6\n  - Value: $0.10 each\n  - Total from dimes = \\(6 \\times 0.10 = \\$0.60\\)\n\n- **Nickels**: \n  - Quantity: 14\n  - Value: $0.05 each\n  - Total from nickels = \\(14 \\times 0.05 = \\$0.70\\)\n\n- **Pennies**: \n  - Quantity: 15\n  - Value: $0.01 each\n  - Total from pennies = \\(15 \\times 0.01 = \\$0.15\\)\n\n### Step 2: Sum Up the Total Money\n\nAdd up all the amounts from the different coins:\n\n\\[\n\\$2.00 + \\$0.60 + \\$0.70 + \\$0.15 = \\$3.45\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Gumballs Colby Can Buy\n\nI will assume the cost of one gumball is known in the problem setup. For calculation purposes, let's assume a gumball costs $0.25 each (this is a common price in many scenarios involving gumballs). \n\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of gumballs Colby can buy} = \\frac{\\$3.45}{\\$0.25} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n= 13.8 \n\\]\n\nBecause Colby cannot purchase a fraction of a gumball, the maximum number of whole gumballs he can buy is 13.\n\nTherefore, Colby can buy **13 gumballs**."
