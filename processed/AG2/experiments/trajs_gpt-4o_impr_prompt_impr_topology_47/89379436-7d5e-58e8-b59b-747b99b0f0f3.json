      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage that the combined length of the remoras contributes to the shark’s body length. However, the shark's body length is not provided in the prompt, which is essential to calculate this percentage. For this problem, I will proceed with the assumption that `S` is the length of the shark in inches.\n\nHere’s a step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. **Identify the Lengths:**\n   - Each remora is 6 inches long.\n   - There are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the Combined Length in Terms of Percentage:**\n   - To find this, we need the formula: \\[\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Combined Length of Remoras}}{\\text{Length of Shark}}\\right) \\times 100\\]\n\n3. **Plug in the Values and Assume the Shark’s Length:**\n   - Let’s denote the shark's length as \\( S \\) inches.\n   - Substitute into the formula: \\[\\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{12}{S}\\right) \\times 100\\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The percentage of the shark’s body length that the remoras contribute is \\(\\left(\\frac{12}{S}\\right) \\times 100\\%\\).\n\nPlease provide the shark's length if known, or we can consider hypothetical lengths to illustrate this concept further."
