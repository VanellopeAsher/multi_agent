  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

Computer (including screen, keyboard, and mouse): €1090\n2. Scanner: €157\n3. CD burner: €74\n4. Printer: €102\n\nNow, let's calculate the total expenditure:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenditure} = \\text{Computer} + \\text{Scanner} + \\text{CD burner} + \\text{Printer} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenditure} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Expenditure} = 1423 \\]\n\nElvira's initial budget was €1500. We subtract her total expenditure from her budget to find out how much money she will have left:\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining Money} = \\text{Initial Budget} - \\text{Total Expenditure} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining Money} = 1500 - 1423 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining Money} = 77 \\]\n\nTherefore, Elvira will have €77 left to spend on her new outfit."
