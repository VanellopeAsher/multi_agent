      "content": "To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we can break the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes**:\n   - Jacket cost: $120\n   - Shoes cost: 2 pairs × $100 each = $200\n   - Total cost = Jacket cost + Shoes cost = $120 + $200 = $320.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount Sara earns from babysitting**:\n   - Babysitting rate: $5 per session.\n   - Sara babysits 10 times, so earnings from babysitting = 10 × $5 = $50.\n\n3. **Calculate Sara's total initial savings**:\n   - Initial savings = $100.\n   - Total savings after babysitting = Initial savings + Babysitting earnings = $100 + $50 = $150.\n\n4. **Calculate the remaining amount needed to buy the jacket and shoes**:\n   - Total cost of items = $320.\n   - Remaining amount needed = Total cost - Total savings = $320 - $150 = $170.\n\n5. **Determine the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn**:\n   - Mowing rate: $10 per lawn.\n   - To earn the remaining $170, the number of times she needs to mow the lawn is \\( \\text{Ceiling of} \\left(\\frac{\\text{Remaining amount}}{\\text{Mowing rate}}\\right) = \\text{Ceiling of} \\left(\\frac{170}{10}\\right) = 17 \\).\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 17 times to afford the jacket and shoes."
