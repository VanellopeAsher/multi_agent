      "content": "To determine the amount of time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total amount of time he spent on his vacation based on the information given, then find 40% of that time.\n\n1. **Calculate the Time Spent on Each Activity Given**:\n   - **Boating**: John spent 6.6 hours.\n   - **Swimming**: Half the time of boating, so \\( \\frac{6.6}{2} = 3.3 \\) hours.\n   - **Watching Shows**: Each show was 2.5 hours and he watched 3 shows, so \\( 3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Total Time for Watching Shows**:\n   - According to the problem, the time spent watching shows was 30% of his total time.\n   - Let \\( T \\) represent the total time spent on vacation.\n   - Therefore, \\( 0.30 \\times T = 7.5 \\) hours.\n   - Solving for \\( T \\), we get \\( T = \\frac{7.5}{0.30} = 25 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Spent Sightseeing**:\n   - Sightseeing accounted for 40% of his total time.\n   - Thus, the time spent sightseeing is \\( 0.40 \\times 25 = 10 \\) hours.\n\nTherefore, John spent 10 hours sightseeing on his vacation."
