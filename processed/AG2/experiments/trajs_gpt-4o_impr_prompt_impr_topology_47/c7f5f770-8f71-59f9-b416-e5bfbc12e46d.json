In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: Griffin starts with 30 french fries.\n\n2. **After Kyle**: Kyle takes 6 fries from Griffin. \n   - Griffin's fries = 30 - 6 = 24 fries.\n\n3. **After Billy**: Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle. Kyle took 6, so Billy takes 2 * 6 = 12 fries.\n   - Griffin's fries = 24 - 12 = 12 fries.\n\n4. **After Ginger**: Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin as \\( x \\).\n   - Griffin's fries = 12 + \\( x \\).\n\n5. **After Colby**: Colby takes 3 less than the amount Kyle took. Kyle took 6 fries, so Colby takes 6 - 3 = 3 fries.\n   - Griffin's fries = 12 + \\( x \\) - 3 = \\( x \\) + 9 fries.\n\n6. **Final Count**: It is given that Griffin ends up with 33 fries.\n   - Therefore, \\( x + 9 = 33 \\).\n\n7. **Solving for \\( x \\)**: We solve for \\( x \\) by:\n   \\[\n   x + 9 = 33 \\\\\n   x = 33 - 9 \\\\\n   x = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries. I will now discuss this solution with the other agents."
