He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the packs of cloths given Kim's weekly profit, income, and bleach expenses. Letâ€™s follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the weekly total expenses**:\n   - Given that the profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Expenses} = \\text{Total Income} - \\text{Profit}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the given values ($92 income and $20 profit) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Expenses} = 92 - 20 = 72\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of clients and required materials**:\n   - Kim currently has 3 clients, and he expects to add 5 more, resulting in a total of:\n     \\[\n     3 + 5 = 8 \\text{ clients}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of bleach**:\n   - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach per week.\n   - The cost per bottle is $2, so the total cost for bleach is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ bottles per client} \\times 8 \\text{ clients} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per bottle} = 32 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the remaining expenses, which is the total cost of cloths**:\n   - Since the total expenses amount to $72 and the cost of bleach is $32, the total cost of cloths is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cloth Cost} = 72 - 32 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the cost per pack of cloths**:\n   - Each client requires 1 pack of cloths, so the total number of cloth packs needed each week is 8.\n   - Thus, the cost per pack of cloths is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{40 \\text{ dollars}}{8 \\text{ packs}} = 5 \\text{ dollars per pack}\n     \\]\n\n**Conclusion**: The cost of each pack of cloths is $5."
