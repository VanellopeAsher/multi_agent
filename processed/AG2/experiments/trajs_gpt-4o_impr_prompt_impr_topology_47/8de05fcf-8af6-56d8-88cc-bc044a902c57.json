      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day and establish the comparison for Wednesday relative to Tuesday.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine Articles Written on Monday and Tuesday:**\n\n   - Monday: Meredith wrote 5 articles.\n   - Tuesday: She wrote \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more articles than she did on Monday. Therefore, on Tuesday, she wrote:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tuesday's Articles} = 5 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 5\\right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ articles}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Hours Spent on Monday and Tuesday:**\n\n   Each article takes 4 hours to complete.\n   \n   - Monday's hours: \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) hours\n   - Tuesday's hours: \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\) hours\n\n   Total hours for Monday and Tuesday:\n   \\[\n   20 + 28 = 48 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find Wednesday's Hours:**\n\n   Meredith spent a total of 104 hours over the three days. Thus, on Wednesday, the hours spent are:\n   \\[\n   104 - 48 = 56 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Articles Written on Wednesday:**\n\n   Since each article takes 4 hours to write:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wednesday's Articles} = \\frac{56}{4} = 14 \\text{ articles}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Ratio of Wednesday's to Tuesday's Articles:**\n\n   On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles, and on Wednesday, she wrote 14 articles. The ratio of Wednesday's articles to Tuesday's articles is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{7} = 2\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\nThis completes the solution: Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday compared to Tuesday."
