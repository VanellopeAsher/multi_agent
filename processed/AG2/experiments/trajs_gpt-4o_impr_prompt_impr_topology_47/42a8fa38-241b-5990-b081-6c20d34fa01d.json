      "content": "To solve the problem of determining the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on buying the tomato and celery seed packets, we'll proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost for Tomato Seed Packets**\n\n   - Mrs. Rylan purchased 20 tomato seed packets.\n   - Each tomato seed packet costs $40.\n   - To find the total cost for the tomato seeds, we multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost of Tomato Seed Packets} = 20 \\, \\text{packets} \\times 40 \\, \\text{USD/packet} = 800 \\, \\text{USD}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Cost for Celery Seed Packets**\n\n   - Mrs. Rylan purchased 80 celery seed packets.\n   - Each celery seed packet costs $30.\n   - To find the total cost for the celery seeds, we multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost of Celery Seed Packets} = 80 \\, \\text{packets} \\times 30 \\, \\text{USD/packet} = 2400 \\, \\text{USD}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost**\n\n   - To find the total amount spent on both types of seeds, add the total costs for the tomato and celery seed packets:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Amount Spent} = 800 \\, \\text{USD} + 2400 \\, \\text{USD} = 3200 \\, \\text{USD}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Mrs. Rylan spent a total of $3200 on purchasing the tomato and celery seed packets. \n\nNow, let's discuss any further questions or insights with the team."
