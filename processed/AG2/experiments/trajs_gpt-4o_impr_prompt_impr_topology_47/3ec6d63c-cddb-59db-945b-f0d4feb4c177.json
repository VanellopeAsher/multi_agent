The problem involved determining the number of 6-point bucks from the total number of bucks in a population of deer, grounded on given percentages.\n\nHere's the breakdown again for confirmation:\n\n1. Total number of deer: 80.\n2. Percentage of deer that are bucks: 30%.\n   - Total number of bucks: \\(0.30 \\times 80 = 24\\).\n\n3. Percentage of bucks that are 6-point: 50%.\n   - Total number of 6-point bucks: \\(0.50 \\times 24 = 12\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution reached by both agents is correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}**"
