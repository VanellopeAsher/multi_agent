Let's break down the calculation with these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the earnings from the milkshakes.\n2. Calculate the earnings from the burger platters.\n3. Calculate the earnings from half of the sodas.\n4. Sum up these earnings to get the total amount of money made.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each\nmilkshakes_sold = 6\nmilkshake_price = 5.50\nmilkshake_earnings = milkshakes_sold * milkshake_price\n\n# Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11.5 each\nburger_platters_sold = 9\nburger_platter_price = 11.5\nburger_platter_earnings = burger_platters_sold * burger_platter_price\n\n# Terry sells half of 40 sodas (i.e., 20 sodas) for $1.50 each\nsodas_sold = 40 // 2  # this gives 20 sodas\nsoda_price = 1.50\nsoda_earnings = sodas_sold * soda_price\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = milkshake_earnings + burger_platter_earnings + soda_earnings\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
