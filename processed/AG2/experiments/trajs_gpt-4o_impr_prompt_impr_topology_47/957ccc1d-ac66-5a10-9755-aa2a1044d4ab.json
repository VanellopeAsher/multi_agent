      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs. We know that burning 1 lb of body weight requires a deficit of 3,500 calories. So, to lose 30 lbs, Andy needs to achieve a total deficit of:\n\n\\[ 30 \\, \\text{lbs} \\times 3,500 \\, \\text{calories/lb} = 105,000 \\, \\text{calories} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th. \n\n- December has 31 days, and Andy starts on December 31st, so we don't count December.\n- January has 31 days.\n- February generally has 28 days, assuming it's not a leap year.\n- March has 31 days.\n- April has 30 days.\n- May has 31 days.\n- June has 30 days.\n- July has 18 days until July 19th.\n\nAdding these, we have:\n\n\\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 18 = 199 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the daily calorie deficit required, we divide the total calories by the number of days:\n\n\\[ \\frac{105,000 \\, \\text{calories}}{199 \\, \\text{days}} \\approx 527.64 \\, \\text{calories/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy needs to maintain an average daily calorie deficit of approximately 528 calories to reach his goal by July 19th."

Let's verify these solutions step by step:\n\n1. **Total Calories Required to Burn**: Both agents correctly calculated the total calories needed to be burned as 105,000 calories (30 lbs * 3,500 calories/lb).\n\n2. **Count of Days from December 31 to July 19**:\n   - There are 199 days, calculated by both agents as follows:\n     - January: 31 days\n     - February: 28 days\n     - March: 31 days\n     - April: 30 days\n     - May: 31 days\n     - June: 30 days\n     - July: 18 days (day 19 not counting)\n\n3. **Daily Calorie Deficit Calculation**: \n   - Problem Solver and Code Executor both resulted in a daily calorie deficit of approximately 527.64 calories per day.\n\nThe solutions are consistent, and the calculations are corroborated by both approaches.
