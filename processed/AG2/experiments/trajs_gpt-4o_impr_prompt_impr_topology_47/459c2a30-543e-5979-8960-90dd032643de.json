      "content": "To determine how many fewer white squares there are than green squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we start by systematically labeling and solving using the given information:\n\n1. **Red Squares**:\n   - The comforter has 14 red squares.\n\n2. **Blue Squares**:\n   - The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares.\n   - Therefore, the number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18.\n\n3. **Green Squares**:\n   - The comforter has 6 more green squares than blue squares.\n   - Therefore, the number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24.\n\n4. **White Squares**:\n   - Let's denote the number of white squares as \\( w \\).\n   - The total area of the comforter is 68 square feet, corresponding to 68 squares because each square is 1-foot by 1-foot.\n   - Therefore, the sum of all colored squares must be 68:\n     \\[\n     14 \\, (\\text{red}) + 18 \\, (\\text{blue}) + 24 \\, (\\text{green}) + w \\, (\\text{white}) = 68\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( w \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     w = 68 - (14 + 18 + 24) = 68 - 56 = 12\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compare White and Green Squares**:\n   - The number of green squares is 24.\n   - The number of white squares is 12.\n   - The difference is:\n     \\[\n     24 - 12 = 12\n     \\]\n\nThus, Brittany's quilted comforter has 12 fewer white squares than green squares."
