In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To determine how much money John spent at the market, we can calculate the total cost of the livestock he purchased.\n\n1. First, calculate the total cost for the goats:\n   - John buys 3 goats, each costing $500.\n   - Total cost for goats = 3 goats * $500/goat = $1,500\n\n2. Next, calculate the total cost for the cows:\n   - John buys 2 cows, each costing $1500.\n   - Total cost for cows = 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3,000\n\n3. Add the costs of the goats and the cows to find the total expenditure:\n   - Total expenditure = Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows\n   - Total expenditure = $1,500 + $3,000 = $4,500\n\nTherefore, John spent a total of $4,500 at the market."
