This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

      "content": "To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we can break down the information provided and calculate step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Activity Time:**\n   - **Boating**: 6 hours\n   - **Swimming**: Half of boating, so 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours\n   - **Watching Shows**: 3 shows Ã— 2 hours each = 6 hours\n\n   The activities that count towards the total time John engaged in are boating, swimming, and watching shows only. Thus, the total time spent on activities is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ (boating) } + 3 \\text{ (swimming) } + 6 \\text{ (watch shows) } = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Total Vacation Time Spent:**\n   - Watching shows represented 30% of the total time.\n   - We know the time spent watching shows was 6 hours.\n\n   Therefore, \\(0.30 \\times \\text{Total Time} = 6 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n   Solving for Total Time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Time} = \\frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute Time Spent Sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing accounted for 40% of the total time.\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 20 \\text{ (Total Time) } = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, John spent 8 hours sightseeing."
