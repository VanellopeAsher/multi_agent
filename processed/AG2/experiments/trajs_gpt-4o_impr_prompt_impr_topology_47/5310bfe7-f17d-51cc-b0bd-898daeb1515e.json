Let \\( R \\) represent the number of goals Richie scored, \\( M \\) represent the number of goals Mark scored, and \\( A \\) represent the number of goals Anna scored.\n2. We know that \\( R = 90 \\) because Richie scored 90 goals.\n3. It is given that Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark. Therefore, the equation relating Richie's and Mark's scores is:\n   \\[\n   R = M + 30\n   \\]\n4. We also know that Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna. Therefore, the equation relating Richie's and Anna's scores is:\n   \\[\n   R = A + 55\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute the known value of \\( R \\) (which is 90) into both equations:\n\n- For Mark:\n  \\[\n  90 = M + 30\n  \\]\n  Solving for \\( M \\), we get:\n  \\[\n  M = 90 - 30 = 60\n  \\]\n\n- For Anna:\n  \\[\n  90 = A + 55\n  \\]\n  Solving for \\( A \\), we get:\n  \\[\n  A = 90 - 55 = 35\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Goals} = R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Goals} = 185\n\\]\n\nTherefore, all three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."
