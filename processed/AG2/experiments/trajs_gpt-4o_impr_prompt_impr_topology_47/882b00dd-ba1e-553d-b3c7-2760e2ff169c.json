On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for Billy and Sally at the specified times and then determine the amount each would earn for 20 hours of work. Finally, we'll compare these amounts to find the difference. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Billy's Earnings Calculation**:\n   - Initial Rate: $10.00 per hour\n   - Rate after 2 months with a $0.50 raise: $10.50 per hour\n   - Rate at 1-year anniversary with an additional $1.00 raise: $11.50 per hour\n   - Since we want to calculate the earnings after one year, Billy's current rate is $11.50 per hour.\n   - Earnings for 20 hours at his current rate: \\(20 \\times 11.50 = 230\\) dollars\n\n2. **Sally's Earnings Calculation**:\n   - Sally's Starting Rate: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour\n   - Rate after 2 months with a $0.50 raise: $11.00 per hour\n   - After two months, Sally's rate becomes $11.00 per hour.\n   - Earnings for 20 hours at her current rate: \\(20 \\times 11.00 = 220\\) dollars\n\n3. **Difference in Earnings**:\n   - Difference in earnings: \\(230 - 220 = 10\\) dollars\n\nSo, Billy will earn $10 more than Sally if both work for 20 hours after accounting for their respective pay raises. \n\nNow, I will engage in discussion with the team to confirm the calculations and the solution."

To ensure accuracy, let's summarize the approach and confirm the results:\n\n1. **Billy's Hourly Rate Calculations**:\n   - Start at $10.00/hour\n   - Increase to $10.50/hour after 2 months\n   - Further increase to $11.50/hour after 1 year\n   - Earnings after 1 year for 20 hours: \n     \\(20 \\times 11.50 = 230\\) dollars\n\n2. **Sally's Hourly Rate Calculations**:\n   - Starting rate: $10.50/hour (because $10.00 + $0.50)\n   - Increase to $11.00/hour after 2 months\n   - Earnings for 20 hours: \n     \\(20 \\times 11.00 = 220\\) dollars\n\n3. **Earnings Difference**:\n   - Billy earns $230\n   - Sally earns $220\n   - Thus, Billy earns $10 more than Sally for the same 20-hour work week after these raises are taken into account.\n\nThe calculations seem accurate. Now, I'll write a Python code to validate these results. Let's proceed with that. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
