      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many action figures Peter can buy within his budget of $70 throughout the week.\n\n1. **Divide the Budget per Day**: \n   Since Peter wants to spend an equal amount each day over the seven days of the week, we first determine how much he can afford to spend daily:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$70}{7} = \\$10 \\text{ per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Spending from Sunday to Wednesday**:\n   From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures that cost $5 each. If he spends $10 each day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$10}{\\$5} = 2 \\text{ wooden action figures per day}\n   \\]\n   Thus, for four days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday):\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ wooden action figures}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Spending from Thursday to Saturday**:\n   From Thursday to Saturday, Peter will buy plastic action figures that cost $2.50 each. Spending $10 each day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$10}{\\$2.50} = 4 \\text{ plastic action figures per day}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, over three days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ plastic action figures}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Action Figures**: \n   Add the number of wooden action figures to the number of plastic action figures to find the total:\n   \\[\n   8 + 12 = 20 \\text{ total action figures}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 20 action figures. \n\nLet's discuss any further questions or insights with the team."
