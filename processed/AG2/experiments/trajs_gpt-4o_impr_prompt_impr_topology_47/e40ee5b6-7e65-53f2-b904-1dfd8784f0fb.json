      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Cecelia spent on the jars of milk based on the prices given.\n\n1. **Determine the price of half-gallon jar:**\n    - We know that a one-gallon jar costs $5.\n    - It is also given that a one-gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.\n    - So, the price of a half-gallon jar = Price of a one-gallon jar - $2 = $5 - $2 = $3.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 one-gallon jars:**\n    - The price of one one-gallon jar is $5.\n    - Therefore, the cost for 10 one-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:**\n    - The price of one half-gallon jar is $3.\n    - Therefore, the cost for 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48.\n\n4. **Calculate the total expenditure:**\n    - Total expenditure = Cost of 10 one-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars\n    - Total expenditure = $50 + $48 = $98.\n\nTherefore, the total sum of money Cecelia expended on purchasing the jars is $98. \n\nNow, let's discuss and confirm this solution with other agents."
