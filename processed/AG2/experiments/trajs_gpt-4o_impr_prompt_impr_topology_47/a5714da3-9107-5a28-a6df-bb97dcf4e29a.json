In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Both solutions indicate that Scarlett's total spending is $23.00. \n\nLet's break down the costs again to ensure accuracy:\n- **Aquarium:** $10.00\n- **Rocks:** 2 bags × $2.50 = $5.00\n- **Coral:** 3 pieces × $2.00 = $6.00\n- **Fish Food:** $2.00\n\nSumming these amounts gives:\n\\[ 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = 23.00 \\]\n\nBoth manually calculated and programmatically computed totals match as $23.00. \n\nTherefore, after verification, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{23.00}**"
