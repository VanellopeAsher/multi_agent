In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break down the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Passengers:**  \n   There are initially 48 passengers on the bus.\n\n2. **First Stop:**\n   - **Passengers Getting Off:** 8 passengers get off the bus.  \n     Remaining passengers = 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.\n   - **Passengers Getting On:** 5 times as many passengers as those who got off (8 passengers) get on.  \n     Number of passengers getting on = 5 * 8 = 40 passengers.\n   - **Adjustment Before Departure:** 2 of the new passengers decide to get off again.  \n     Remaining after adjustment = 40 - 2 = 38 new passengers on.\n   - **Total After First Stop:** 40 (original remaining) + 38 (new passengers) = 78 passengers.\n\n3. **Second Stop:**\n   - **Passengers Getting Off:** 21 passengers get off the bus.  \n     Remaining passengers = 78 - 21 = 57 passengers.\n   - **Passengers Getting On:** 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off.  \n     Since \"3 times fewer\" implies a smaller portion based on division, we interpret this as `1/3` of the number who got off get on.\n     Number of passengers getting on = 21 / 3 = 7 passengers.\n   - **Total After Second Stop:** 57 (remaining) + 7 (new passengers) = 64 passengers.\n\nTherefore, after the second stop, there are **64 passengers** riding the bus."
