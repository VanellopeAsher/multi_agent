      "content": "To address the problem of determining how much protein John gets from eating 300 grams of mushrooms each day for a week, we can break down the solution into the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Protein Content per 150 Grams:**\n   - 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein.\n\n2. **Determine the Protein Content per Gram:**\n   - To find the protein content per gram of mushrooms, divide the protein content by the weight in grams:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Protein per gram} = \\frac{4 \\text{ grams of protein}}{150 \\text{ grams of mushrooms}} = \\frac{4}{150} \\text{ grams of protein per gram}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Protein per gram} = \\frac{2}{75} \\approx 0.0267 \\text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Daily Protein Intake:**\n   - If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms each day, the daily protein intake is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Daily protein} = 300 \\text{ grams} \\times \\frac{2}{75} \\text{ grams of protein per gram}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Daily protein} = 300 \\times 0.0267 \\approx 8 \\text{ grams of protein per day}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Weekly Protein Intake:**\n   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily intake by 7:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Weekly protein} = 8 \\text{ grams per day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 56 \\text{ grams of protein per week}\n     \\]\n\nSo, John gets approximately 56 grams of protein per week from eating 300 grams of mushrooms every day."
