In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate his age as:\n     \\[ \\text{Age of the younger brother} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) \\times 20 = 12 \\, \\text{years} \\]\n\n4. **Determine the age of the older brother:**\n   - The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother.\n   - Therefore, the age of the older brother is:\n     \\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\, \\text{years} \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**\n   - We add up the ages of all the siblings:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total age} = (3 \\times 16) + 12 + 24 = 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 \\, \\text{years}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
