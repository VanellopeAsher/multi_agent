      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to set up an algebraic system based on the given conditions. \n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - The mural uses four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.\n   - The total amount of paint used for the mural is 12 pints.\n   - Half of the mural is painted yellow, which implies the amount of yellow paint is 6 pints (since half of 12 pints is 6 pints).\n   - The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal.\n\n2. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( R \\) represent the pints of red paint.\n   - Let \\( W \\) represent the pints of white paint.\n   - Let \\( P \\) represent the pints of purple paint.\n\n3. **Formulate the Equations:**\n   - Since red, white, and purple use the same amount of paint, we have:\n     \\[\n     R = W = P\n     \\]\n   - The total amount of paint used is:\n     \\[\n     R + W + P + 6 = 12\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equations:**\n   - Substitute \\( W \\) and \\( P \\) with \\( R \\), since \\( R = W = P \\):\n     \\[\n     R + R + R + 6 = 12\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     3R + 6 = 12\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     3R = 6\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 3 to solve for \\( R \\):\n     \\[\n     R = 2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The amount of red paint used is 2 pints.\n\nIn summary, the mural uses 2 pints of red paint. Let's discuss this approach with the other agents to ensure clarity and correctness."
