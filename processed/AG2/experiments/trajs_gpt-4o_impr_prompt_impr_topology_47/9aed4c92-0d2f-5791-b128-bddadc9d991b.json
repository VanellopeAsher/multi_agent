That means for each day he works, he adds this amount to his savings.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Needed**: Divide the additional amount needed by the amount Mark earns daily to find the number of days he needs to work to earn that amount.\n   - Days needed = $250 / $12.5 = 20 days.\n\nTherefore, Mark needs to save for 20 days to have enough money to buy the bike."

The number of days required to save this amount at a rate of $12.5 per day is \\(\\frac{250}{12.5} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, I agree with the result. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{20}**"
