      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Joey's score after his turn**: Since the problem does not state how many points Joey scores, let's denote the points Joey scores as \\( x \\). After his turn, his score will be \\( 214 + x \\).\n\n2. **Determine Marcy's score after her turn**: Marcy starts with 225 points and scores an additional 10 points. Her new score is \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the point difference**: To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we calculate the difference between Joey's score and Marcy's score:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = (214 + x) - 235\n   \\]\n\nThis results in:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 214 + x - 235 = x - 21\n   \\]\n\nThus, Joey is winning by \\( x - 21 \\) points, where \\( x \\) represents the additional points Joey scored during his turn.\n\nNow that I have documented the solution, let's engage in discussion, if needed."

The final result is \\( x - 21 \\). This indicates that Joey's lead depends on the points \\( x \\) he scores. Without knowing the exact points scored by Joey, we conclude that he is winning by \\( x - 21 \\) points."
