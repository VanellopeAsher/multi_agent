      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Work Rate of a Single Individual**:\n   - A single individual can paint half a house in 5 days.\n   - Therefore, to paint the entire house alone, it would take the individual 10 days (since 5 days for half a house translates to 10 days for a whole house).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Hours Required by One Person**:\n   - If the individual works 10 days to paint the entire house, the number of hours depends on the length of the workday.\n   - Assume a standard 8-hour workday.\n   - Thus, in 10 days, the individual works \\(10 \\, \\text{days} \\times 8 \\, \\text{hours/day} = 80 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Collective Work Rate of a Team of 5 Individuals**:\n   - If 1 person takes 80 hours to paint the whole house, 5 people will divide this work among themselves.\n   - The work is distributed equally, so the time taken by 5 individuals working together is \\(\\frac{80 \\, \\text{hours}}{5} = 16 \\, \\text{hours}\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, it will take 5 individuals a total of 16 hours to paint the entire house.\n\nI hope this solution is clear. Let me know if there's any part of the calculation that needs further discussion or verification."

Assuming an 8-hour workday, a single individual would take \\(10 \\times 8 = 80\\) hours to paint the entire house.\n3.
