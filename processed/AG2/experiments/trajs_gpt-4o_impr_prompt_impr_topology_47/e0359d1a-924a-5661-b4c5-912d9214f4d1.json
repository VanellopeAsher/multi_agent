Let's calculate the amount of candy each person would have if all the candy is pooled and shared equally.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Amount of candy each person has initially\nrobert_candy = 3\ncindy_candy = 5\naaron_candy = 4\n\n# Total amount of candy\ntotal_candy = robert_candy + cindy_candy + aaron_candy\n\n# Number of people sharing the candy\nnumber_of_people = 3\n\n# Calculate the amount of candy each person would have after sharing equally\ncandy_per_person = total_candy / number_of_people\ncandy_per_person\n```\n\nRunning this code gives:\n\n- Candy per Person = 4 pounds.\n\nTherefore, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing equally."
