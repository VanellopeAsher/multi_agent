You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs were found by the friends. Here's how to approach it:\n\nWe know:\n- The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\) eggs.\n- All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.\n\nLet's denote the total number of eggs as \\(E\\). Thus, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Total eggs found by Smith twins} + \\text{Total eggs found by friends} + 10 = E \\]\n\nGiven that the total eggs found by Smith twins is 60, and friends found the rest except 10, we can represent it as:\n\\[ 60 + \\text{Eggs found by friends} + 10 = E \\]\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{Eggs found by friends} = E - 60 - 10 \\]\n  \nSince all the eggs were found except 10, we can equate the total number of eggs to:\n\\[ E = \\text{Eggs found by Smith twins} + \\text{Eggs found by friends} + 10 \\]\n\nWe can substitute the expression for the eggs found by friends:\n\\[ E = 60 + (E - 60 - 10) + 10 \\]\n\nSolving for the eggs found by friends:\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nE = symbols('E')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(E, 60 + (E - 60 - 10) + 10)\n\n# Solve the equation for E and calculate eggs found by friends\nsolution_E = solve(equation, E)[0]\neggs_found_by_friends = solution_E - 60 - 10\n\n# Print the result in the specified format\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends)\n```\n\nRun this Python code, and it will give you the number of eggs found by the friends."

There isn't a need to solve for \\(E\\) explicitly.\n\nSo, the eggs found by friends are:\n\\[ \\text{Eggs found by friends} = 60 - 0\\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs found by friends is simply \\(60\\).\n\nLet's correct the code:\n```python\n# Calculate eggs found by friends\neggs_found_by_friends = 60\n\n# Print the result\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the correct number of eggs found by the friends. \\(\\boxed{60}\\) eggs."
