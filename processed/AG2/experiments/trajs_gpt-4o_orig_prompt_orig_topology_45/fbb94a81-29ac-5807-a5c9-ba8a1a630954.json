You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:  \n   \\( p + a + j = 100 \\)\n\n2. Paul is 18 years older than Jean:  \n   \\( a = j + 18 \\)\n\n3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:  \n   \\( p = a + j \\)\n\nLet's use these equations to find the age of Peter. We can substitute \\( a = j + 18 \\) into the equations and solve for \\( p \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\n# Define the variables\np, a, j = symbols('p a j')\n\n# Create the equations based on the problem statement\nequation1 = Eq(p + a + j, 100)\nequation2 = Eq(a, j + 18)\nequation3 = Eq(p, a + j)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((equation1, equation2, equation3), (p, a, j))\n\n# Extract the age of Peter\npeter_age = solution[p]\n\n# Print the age of Peter in a fraction/radical form if necessary (sympy handles exact forms naturally)\nprint(peter_age)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `sympy` package to symbolically solve the system of equations, finding the exact value for Peter's age in the process. The solution is printed directly, and because `sympy` handles symbolic math, the result will be in an exact, non-decimal form."
