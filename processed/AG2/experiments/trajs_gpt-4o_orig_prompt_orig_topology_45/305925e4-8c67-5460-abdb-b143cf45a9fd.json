You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJoey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble.

      "content": "To determine how many points Joey is now winning by, we need to calculate his new score and compare it with Marcy's new score.\n\nHere's how we'll solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. Joey initially has 214 points. We need to find Joey's new score, but the problem doesn't tell us exactly how many points he scored. Therefore, we'll call the points he scored \\( x \\). Joey's new score is \\( 214 + x \\).\n\n2. Marcy initially has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points. Therefore, Marcy's new score is \\( 225 + 10 = 235 \\).\n\n3. We want to find out how many points Joey is winning by, which is Joey's new score minus Marcy's new score. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = (214 + x) - 235\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the expression to determine the difference in their scores.\n\nLet's compute this using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the symbol for the points Joey scored\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Joey's new score: 214 + x\njoey_score = 214 + x\n\n# Marcy's new score: 235\nmarcy_score = 235\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = simplify(joey_score - marcy_score)\n\n# Display the result\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nYou can solve for \\( x \\) when you know how many points Joey scored to find the exact difference. But without further information, the expression in terms of \\( x \\) is what we have."
