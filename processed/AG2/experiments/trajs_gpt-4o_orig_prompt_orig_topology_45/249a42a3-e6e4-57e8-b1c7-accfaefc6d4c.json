You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

Determine how many of these days Billy takes off (20% of the total days).\n3. Calculate the number of days Billy actually works.\n4. Determine how many people Billy helps per day.\n5. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps over the days he works.\n\nNow, let's proceed with these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:**\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 19th includes 19 days from April.\n   - Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of days Billy takes off:**\n   - Billy takes off 20% of 50 days.\n   - Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days Billy works:**\n   - Days worked = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. **Determine how many people Billy helps per day:**\n   - Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours a day.\n   - People helped per day = 2 * 3.5 = 7 people.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of people Billy helps over 40 days:**\n   - Total people helped = Days worked * People helped per day = 40 * 7 = 280 people.\n\nFinally, let's display the solution using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Given constants\npeople_per_hour = 2\nhours_per_day = Rational(7, 2)  # 3.5 hours\ntotal_days = 31 + 19  # 31 days in March + 19 days in April\ndays_off_percentage = Rational(20, 100)\n\n# Calculations\ndays_off = days_off_percentage * total_days\ndays_worked = total_days - days_off\npeople_helped_per_day = people_per_hour * hours_per_day\ntotal_people_helped = days_worked * people_helped_per_day\n\nprint(total_people_helped)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total number of people Billy helps, which is \\(\\boxed{280}\\)."
