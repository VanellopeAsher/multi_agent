You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Amora and Lainey each received 700 corn chips.\n2. There are two people who receive an equal amount (700 each), and one person receives 150 chips more than the others.\n\nGiven this information, we can set up an equation to find the total number of corn chips:\n\n- Let the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey received be \\( x = 700 \\).\n- Then, Collins received \\( x + 150 \\) corn chips.\n\nThe total number of corn chips can be calculated by summing the amounts each person received:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total chips} = x + x + (x + 150)\n\\]\n\nNow let's plug in the value of \\( x \\) and solve for the total number of chips using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the amount Amora and Lainey received\nx = symbols('x')\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(2*x + (x + 150), 3*x + 150)\n\n# Solve the equation using the value of x = 700\ntotal_chips = equation.subs(x, 700)\n\n# Print the total number of corn chips\nprint(total_chips)\n```\n\nBy executing this code, you'll find the total number of corn chips. Make sure to interpret the results using the \\(\\boxed{}\\) format for the final answer."
