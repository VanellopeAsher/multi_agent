You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many action figures Peter can buy with his budget of $70 over the course of one week. Given that he has specific spending habits and prices for the figures on different days, we'll break down his spending on each day.\n\n### Key Idea:\n\nPeter's goal is to spend his $70 equally over the seven days of the week. \n\n1. **Calculate Daily Spending:**\n\n   Peter will spend his money equally each day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily Spending} = \\frac{70}{7} = 10 \\text{ dollars per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Action Figures Bought:**\n\n   - **Sunday through Wednesday:**\n     - From Sunday to Wednesday (4 days), Peter buys wooden action figures at $5 each.\n     - Each day, he can buy:\n     \\[ \n     \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\text{ wooden action figures per day}\n     \\]\n     - Total wooden action figures for Sunday through Wednesday:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ wooden action figures}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Thursday through Saturday:**\n     - From Thursday to Saturday (3 days), Peter buys plastic action figures at $2.5 each.\n     - Each day, he can buy:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{2.5} = 4 \\text{ plastic action figures per day}\n     \\]\n     - Total plastic action figures for Thursday through Saturday:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ plastic action figures}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Action Figures:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ (wooden)} + 12 \\text{ (plastic)} = 20 \\text{ total action figures}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's execute a Python program to verify this.\n\n```python\n# Code to calculate the total number of action figures Peter buys in the week\n\n# Daily budget\ndaily_budget = 70 / 7\n\n# Sunday to Wednesday: wooden action figures at $5 each\nwooden_figures_per_day = daily_budget / 5\ntotal_wooden_figures = 4 * wooden_figures_per_day\n\n# Thursday to Saturday: plastic action figures at $2.5 each\nplastic_figures_per_day = daily_budget / 2.5\ntotal_plastic_figures = 3 * plastic_figures_per_day\n\n# Total action figures\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_figures + total_plastic_figures\n\n# Output the result\nprint(total_action_figures)\n```\n\nThe result will confirm that Peter can purchase \\(\\boxed{20}\\) action figures by the end of the week."
