You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We will use Python to handle these calculations.\n\n**Key idea**: This problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\nLet's break down the cost calculations and solve it step by step.\n\n1. Compute the total cost of the hamburgers.\n2. Compute the total cost of the potato fries.\n3. Assume we don't have the cost of the drinks, and clarify it in the input.\n4. Calculate the total cost and subtract from $50 to find the change.\n\nLet's proceed with the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Costs of individual items\nhamburger_cost = 4\nfries_cost = Rational(30, 100)  # 0.30 dollars\n\n# Quantities\nhamburgers = 5\nfries = 10\n\n# Total costs\ntotal_hamburgers_cost = hamburgers * hamburger_cost\ntotal_fries_cost = fries * fries_cost\n\n# Assuming we do not know the cost of fruit drinks, let's denote it as a variable\nfruit_drink_cost = symbols('fruit_drink_cost')\n\n# Cans of fruit drinks\nfruit_drinks = 5\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = total_hamburgers_cost + total_fries_cost + fruit_drinks * fruit_drink_cost\n\n# Amount given\namount_given = 50\n\n# Calculate change\nchange = amount_given - total_cost\n\n# Output the expression for change\nprint(f'Change expression: {change}')\n```\n\nThis code will help you establish the relationship with an unknown variable `fruit_drink_cost`; you need to define this variable or provide its value to find the exact change."

However, without this information, I can assume a common cost for the fruit drinks to demonstrate how to calculate the change.\n\nAssuming each can of fruit drink costs $1 (you can replace this value later if you have a different cost), let's perform the calculation:\n\nLet's substitute the cost of the fruit drinks into the change expression:\n\n\\[\n\\text{fruit\\_drink\\_cost} = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into \\[ 27 - 5 \\times \\text{fruit\\_drink\\_cost} \\]:\n\n```python\n# Let's assume the cost of one fruit drink is $1\nfruit_drink_cost_value = 1\n\n# Calculate the change by substituting the cost of the fruit drink\nactual_change = 27 - 5 * fruit_drink_cost_value\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Change Carly receives: {actual_change}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will yield the change Carly receives with these assumptions. Let me calculate it for you:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Actual Change} = 27 - 5 \\times 1 = 22\n\\]\n\nThus, under the assumption that each fruit drink costs $1, the change Carly receives is \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars.
