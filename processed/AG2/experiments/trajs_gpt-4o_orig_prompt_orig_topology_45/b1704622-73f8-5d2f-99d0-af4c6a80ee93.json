You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to determine the number of hours Bruce worked each day and then calculate the total for the three days. Let's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. On Tuesday, Bruce is occupied for 5 hours. Let's denote this as:\n   - \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n2. On Wednesday, he works double the hours he worked on Tuesday. Thus, the work hours for Wednesday are:\n   - \\( W = 2 \\times T = 2 \\times 5 \\).\n\n3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than his Wednesday's work hours. Thus, the work hours for Thursday are:\n   - \\( Th = W - 2 \\).\n\n4. Finally, we'll sum up the work hours for all three days to get the total number of hours worked:\n   - Total hours = \\( T + W + Th \\).\n\nWe'll use Python to calculate this.\n\n```python\n# Define the hours worked on each day\nT = 5                       # Tuesday\nW = 2 * T                   # Wednesday\nTh = W - 2                  # Thursday\n\n# Calculate the total hours\ntotal_hours = T + W + Th\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_hours)\n```\n\nBy running this code, you'll find the total number of hours Bruce has worked over the three days."
