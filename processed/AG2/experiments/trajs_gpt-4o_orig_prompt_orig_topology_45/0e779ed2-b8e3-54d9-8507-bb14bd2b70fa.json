You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

Calculate the age of the older brother.\n4. Sum the ages to find the total age of all siblings.\n\nWe'll use Python with the `sympy` library to ensure we work with exact fractions when necessary.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the age of the sisters\nage_of_sisters = Rational(16)  # Because 1.6 times ten is 16\ntotal_age_sisters = 3 * age_of_sisters  # 3 sisters\n\n# Calculate the age of the younger brother\nyounger_brother_age = Rational(3, 5) * 20  # 3/5 of 20\n\n# Calculate the age of the older brother, twice the age of the younger brother\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# Calculate the total age of all siblings\ntotal_age = total_age_sisters + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\n# Display the total age\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the total age of all the siblings in exact form."
