You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMartha is planning her Christmas party.

We will account for people invited, subtract those who could not attend due to illness, and those with previous commitments. Let's categorize this as Case 1 since it can be solved with Python directly.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people invited from the families.\n2. Subtract the number of people who could not attend due to illness.\n3. Subtract the number of people who had previous commitments.\n4. Calculate the final number of attendees.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to solve this problem.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of people invited\nfamilies_of_6 = 12\npeople_per_family_6 = 6\nfamilies_of_4 = 15\npeople_per_family_4 = 4\n\ntotal_invited = (families_of_6 * people_per_family_6) + (families_of_4 * people_per_family_4)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate those who couldn't come due to illness\npeople_absent_due_to_illness = 16\n\n# Step 3: Calculate those who had previous commitments\npeople_with_commitments = Rational(1, 4) * people_absent_due_to_illness\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total number of people who show up\nattendees = total_invited - people_absent_due_to_illness - people_with_commitments\n\n# Print the result\nprint(attendees)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the number of people who show up in fractional form, as required."
