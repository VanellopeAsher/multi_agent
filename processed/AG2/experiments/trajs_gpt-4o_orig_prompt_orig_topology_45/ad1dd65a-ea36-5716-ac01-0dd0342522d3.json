You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAn electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each and gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills.

Calculate the total cost of 5 phones by multiplying the price of one phone by 5.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the tablet and the headphones.\n3. Add all these costs to get the total amount spent.\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the cash given ($4000).\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total cost of 5 phones\ncost_of_phones = 5 * 700\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the tablet and headphones\ncost_of_tablet = 330\ncost_of_headphones = 137\ntotal_cost = cost_of_phones + cost_of_tablet + cost_of_headphones\n\n# Cash given\ncash_given = 4000\n\n# Calculate the change to be given back\nchange = cash_given - total_cost\n\n# Print the change in radical form, though in this problem it will be an integer\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(Rational(change))\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we'll get the amount of change the seller should give back."
