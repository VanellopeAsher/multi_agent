We'll solve the equations manually to sidestep computational complexity in your environment.\n\n### Problem Overview\n\n1. **Equations:**\n   - Peter’s Age: \\( P = 1.5K - 5 \\)\n   - Sum of Ages: \\( P + K + J = 100 \\)\n\n### Manual Steps\n\n1. Substitute the expression for Peter's age in terms of Paul's age:\n   \\[\n   (1.5K - 5) + K + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify and solve:\n   \\[\n   1.5K + K + J - 5 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.5K + J = 105\n   \\]\n\n3. Express \\( J \\) in terms of \\( K \\):\n   \\[\n   J = 105 - 2.5K\n   \\]\n\nWe need either \\( K \\) or additional information to find specific ages. Let's assume a reasonable middle ground:\n\nLet's find \\( K \\) assuming additional constraints do not yield timeout:\n\n```python\n# Import sympy again\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Variables\nK = symbols('K')\n\n# Simplified equation from the manual steps\neq = Eq(2.5*K + (105 - 2.5*K), 100)\n\n# Solve for K\nk_value = solve(eq, K)[0]\n\n# Use K to find Peter's age\nP = 1.5*k_value - 5\n\n# Print calculated ages\nprint(P)\n```\n\nThis should yield Peter's age directly if hypothetical \\( K \\) constraints were applied directly without exhaustive var checks.\n\nIf this resolves the issue, Jean's age can also be derived by eliminating \\( K \\)'s dependency. Engage a hypothetical \\( J\\) result from Jean as equally partitioned to ease steps beyond \\( P \\).\n\nIf not, let me set more specific plausible constraints or values to resolve distinct from timeout iterations at service without computational overlaps."
