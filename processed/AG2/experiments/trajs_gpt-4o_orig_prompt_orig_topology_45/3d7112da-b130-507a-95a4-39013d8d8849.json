You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first determine the total time John spent on all activities and use it to find how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe'll use the information given to set up the equations that will yield the total time John spent on vacation. From the total time, we can determine the time spent sightseeing.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Calculate the time spent swimming.\n2. Calculate the time spent on activities other than sightseeing.\n3. Use the percentage information to determine the overall time spent on vacation.\n4. Calculate the time spent sightseeing using the percentage provided.\n\nNow, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Time spent on each activity:**\n   - Boating: 6.6 hours\n   - Swimming: 6.6 / 2 = 3.3 hours\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows Ã— 2.5 hours each = 7.5 hours\n\n2. **Calculate the total time not including sightseeing:**\n   - Total time (without sightseeing) = Boating + Swimming + Watching shows = 6.6 + 3.3 + 7.5 = 17.4 hours\n\n3. **Determine total vacation time:**\n   - Watching time (7.5 hours) is 30% of total time:  \n     Let \\( T \\) be the total time spent.\n     \\[ 0.3T = 7.5 \\]  \n     \\[ T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing is 40% of \\( T \\):\n   \\[ \\text{Sightseeing time} = 0.4T \\]\n\nLet's perform the calculation using Python:\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Rational\n\n# Let T be the total time\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# equation for the total time based on the watching shows time\nequation = Rational(3, 10) * T - 7.5\n\n# solve for T\ntotal_time = solve(equation, T)[0]\n\n# calculate sightseeing time (40% of total time)\nsightseeing_time = Rational(4,10) * total_time\n\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the exact amount of time John spent sightseeing in fractional hours.\nThe result, displayed in \\(\\boxed{}\\), shows the final solution."
