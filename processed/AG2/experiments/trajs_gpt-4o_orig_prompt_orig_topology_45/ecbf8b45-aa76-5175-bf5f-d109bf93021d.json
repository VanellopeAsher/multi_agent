You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw during their water balloon fight. Let's go through this step-by-step.\n\n### Key Idea\n- We know that the total number of balloons initially was a certain number of packs with 30 balloons each.\n- By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.\n- We need to calculate the total number of balloons thrown, which is the total initial count of balloons minus the 12 remaining.\n\n### Steps to Solve\n1. Represent the total number of packs as a variable (let's call it `packs`).\n2. Calculate the total initial count of balloons using this variable.\n3. Subtract the 12 balloons left at the end to find out how many were thrown.\n\nLet's write a Python program to handle this calculation directly, assuming `packs` is known. For this solution, I'll provide a symbolic answer with a variable `packs`.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the number of packs\npacks = symbols('packs')\n\n# Total number of balloons is the number of packs times 30\ntotal_balloons = packs * 30\n\n# Balloons thrown is total balloons minus 12 remaining\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - 12\n\n# Output the result\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nThis code outputs the expression for the number of balloons thrown, given the number of packs. To find the exact number without assuming the value for `packs`, you would need the specific number of packs used during the fight. If you can provide that number, I can help you calculate the exact count of balloons thrown."

So, based on the expression:\n\n- \\(30 \\times \\text{packs} - 12\\)\n\nWe have successfully established how the number of balloons thrown can be calculated in terms of the number of packs. If you know the specific value for `packs`, you can substitute it into this expression to find the exact number of balloons thrown.\n\nFor instance, if you had 5 packs of balloons, you would calculate:\n\\[ 30 \\times 5 - 12 = 150 - 12 = 138 \\]\n\nTherefore, when you know the number of packs, you can easily determine the number of balloons thrown. Let me know if you have a specific number of packs, and I can compute that for you. If not, the expression \\(\\boxed{30 \\times \\text{packs} - 12}\\) is the solution template."
