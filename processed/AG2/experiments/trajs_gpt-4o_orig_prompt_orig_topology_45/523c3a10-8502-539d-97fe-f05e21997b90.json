You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery packet of graham crackers can be used to create the base for 8 big smores.

First, calculate the total number of s'mores needed.\n2. Determine how many packets are needed since each packet makes s'mores.\n3. Convert the required packets into the number of boxes, using integer division and rounding up.\n\nLet's rewrite the code to handle this correctly:\n\n```python\nfrom math import ceil\n\n# Total s'mores needed\ntotal_smores_children = 9 * 2\ntotal_smores_adults = 6 * 1\ntotal_smores_needed = total_smores_children + total_smores_adults\n\n# Calculate packets needed\nsmores_per_packet = 8\npackets_needed = ceil(total_smores_needed / smores_per_packet)\n\n# Convert packets into boxes\npackets_per_box = 3\nboxes_needed = ceil(packets_needed / packets_per_box)\n\nprint(boxes_needed)\n```\n\nUsing this code, you'll get the correct number of boxes needed.
