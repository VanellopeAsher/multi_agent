He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Elliott finished half of his steps by walking to and from school: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Half of the steps} = \\frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\n2. Elliott did another 1,000 steps with his friend:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Steps after walk with friend} = 1,000 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\n3. Elliott did 500 steps going shopping:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Steps from shopping} = 500 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of steps performed excluding his jog:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total steps excluding jog} = 5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\n\nElliott only had 2,000 steps left after his jog.\n\nThe number of steps taken during his jog can be calculated by subtracting the total steps he has taken excluding the jog from the total daily goal minus the steps left:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Steps during jog} = 10,000 - \\text{Total steps excluding jog} - \\text{Steps left}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Steps during jog} = 10,000 - 6,500 - 2,000\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Steps calculation\ntotal_steps_goal = 10000\nsteps_half = total_steps_goal / 2 \nsteps_friend_walk = 1000\nsteps_shopping = 500\nsteps_remaining = 2000\n\nsteps_excluding_jog = steps_half + steps_friend_walk + steps_shopping\nsteps_jog = total_steps_goal - steps_excluding_jog - steps_remaining\n\nprint(steps_jog)\n```\n\nRunning the code will give us the number of steps he took during his jog.
