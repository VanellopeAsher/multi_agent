You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

For the purpose of this calculation, we won't include Netflix in the debt payments, as it's offset by a coupon.\n\nHere is the plan:\n\n1. Calculate her increased debt payments per month.\n2. Calculate the total debt payments for a year.\n\nLet's handle the details:\n\n1. Her original minimum debt payments per month are:\n   - Student loans: $300\n   - Credit card: $200\n   - Mortgage: $500\n\n2. Total minimum debt payments per month: \\(300 + 200 + 500 = 1000\\)\n\n3. She decides to pay 50% more on her debts. Calculate the increased payments:\n   - 50% of the minimum debt payments is \\(0.5 \\times 1000 = 500\\)\n   - So, increased total debt payments per month: \\(1000 + 500\\)\n\n4. Calculate the total annual debt payments by multiplying the increased monthly payments by 12 months.\n\nWe will now write a Python program to compute the solution.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total monthly debt payments before the 50% increase\nminimum_total = 300 + 200 + 500\n\n# Calculate the 50% increase on her debts\nincrease = minimum_total * 0.5\n\n# Calculate the new monthly payment after increasing by 50%\nnew_monthly_payment = minimum_total + increase\n\n# Calculate the total payments for her debts in a year\nannual_debt_payment = new_monthly_payment * 12\n\n# Print the result\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(\"Total payments for debts in a year:\", Rational(annual_debt_payment))\n```\n\nThis program will calculate and print the total payments Jessica needs to make in a year for her debts, considering the 50% increase in her payments."
