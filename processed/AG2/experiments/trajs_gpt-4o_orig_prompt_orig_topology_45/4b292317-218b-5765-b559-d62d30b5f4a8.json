You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts.

Marty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that needs to be first divided into 40 equal parts.\n2. Each of these 40 pieces will then be further divided into 50 equal parts.\n3. The length of each final cut will be the total length of the ribbon divided by both 40 and 50.\n\nLet's proceed to calculate the length of each final cut using Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total length of the ribbon in millimeters\ntotal_length_mm = 10000\n\n# First, divide into 40 equal parts\nfirst_cut = total_length_mm / 40\n\n# Each of these parts is further divided into 50 equal parts\nfinal_cut = first_cut / 50\n\n# Use Rational to keep it in fractional form\nfinal_cut_fraction = Rational(total_length_mm, 40 * 50)\n\nprint(final_cut_fraction)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the length of each final piece of the ribbon in fractional form."
