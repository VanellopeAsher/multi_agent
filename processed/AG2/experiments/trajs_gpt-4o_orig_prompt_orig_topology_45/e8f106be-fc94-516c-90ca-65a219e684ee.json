His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step. James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers around his backyard fence, which is a rectangle measuring \\(20\\) feet by \\(15\\) feet. He also has a tree, but since he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree, we only need to calculate the amount of crepe paper required to go around the perimeter of the fence.\n\n**Key Idea**: \nThe problem can be solved directly using Python by calculating the perimeter of the rectangular fence.\n\n**Solution**:\nTo find the total length of crepe paper needed, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nIn this case, the length is \\(20\\) feet and the width is \\(15\\) feet. Let's write the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\nlength = 20\nwidth = 15\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nRun this code to get the number of feet of crepe paper James needs to buy."
