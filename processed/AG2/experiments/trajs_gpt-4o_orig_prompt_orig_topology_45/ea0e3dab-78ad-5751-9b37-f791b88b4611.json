You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $200 per month.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \\$2220. \n\nThe calculations are as follows:\n- For the first half of the year (6 months), she paid: \\(200 \\, \\text{USD/month} \\times 6 \\, \\text{months} = 1200 \\, \\text{USD}\\).\n- For the second half of the year, she paid 15% less than 200 USD/month. The monthly charge with the discount is: \n  \\[\n  200 \\times (1 - 0.15) = 200 \\times 0.85 = 170 \\, \\text{USD/month}\n  \\]\n- Thus, for the last 6 months, she paid: \\(170 \\times 6 = 1020 \\, \\text{USD}\\).\n\nAdding these amounts gives us the total for the whole year:\n\\[\n1200 + 1020 = 2220 \\, \\text{USD}\n\\]\n\nHence, the total amount Aleena paid is \\(\\boxed{2220 \\, \\text{USD}}\\)."
