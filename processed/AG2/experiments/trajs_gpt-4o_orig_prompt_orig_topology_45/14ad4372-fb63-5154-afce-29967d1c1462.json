Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate Daily Earnings on Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**\n   - Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.\n   - Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15 per student.\n   - Her earnings per class: \\(15 \\times 15 = 225\\) dollars.\n   - Her earnings per day on weekdays: \\(5 \\times 225\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Weekly Earnings for Weekdays:**\n   - There are 5 weekdays: Monday to Friday.\n   - Multiply the daily earnings by 5 to get the total earnings for weekdays.\n\n3. **Calculate Earnings on Saturday:**\n   - On Saturday, Judy teaches 8 classes.\n   - Her earnings per Saturday: \\(8 \\times 225\\).\n\n4. **Calculate Total Weekly Earnings:**\n   - Add the total earnings from weekdays and the earnings on Saturday.\n\nNow, let's write a Python program to calculate this using the `print` function for output.\n\n```python\n# Calculate earnings per class\nearnings_per_class = 15 * 15\n\n# Calculate earnings for weekdays (Monday to Friday)\nweekdays_daily_earnings = 5 * earnings_per_class\nweekdays_total_earnings = 5 * weekdays_daily_earnings\n\n# Calculate earnings for Saturday\nsaturday_earnings = 8 * earnings_per_class\n\n# Calculate total weekly earnings\ntotal_weekly_earnings = weekdays_total_earnings + saturday_earnings\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(total_weekly_earnings)\n```\n\nWhen we run this code, it will calculate and print the total amount of money Judy makes in one week.
