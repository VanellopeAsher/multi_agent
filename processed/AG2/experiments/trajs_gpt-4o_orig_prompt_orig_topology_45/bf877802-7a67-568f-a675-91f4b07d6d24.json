The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to track the movement of the sun relative to the ground angle as described. We have two phases of movement:\n\n1. **First Phase**: The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours.\n2. **Second Phase**: The sun moves at 3 degrees per hour for 2 additional hours.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n- The initial angle of the sun (at the tip of the pyramid) is 32 degrees from the ground.\n- In the first phase, the sun moves \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) degrees upward.\n- In the second phase, the sun moves \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) degrees upward.\n\nFinally, we add these angular movements to the initial angle to find the new angle. Let's calculate this using Python, keeping everything in degrees.\n\n```python\n# Initialize given angles and rates\ninitial_angle = 32\nfirst_phase_rate = 5\nfirst_phase_duration = 10\nsecond_phase_rate = 3\nsecond_phase_duration = 2\n\n# Calculate total angle change\nangle_change_first_phase = first_phase_rate * first_phase_duration\nangle_change_second_phase = second_phase_rate * second_phase_duration\n\n# Calculate final angle\nfinal_angle = initial_angle + angle_change_first_phase + angle_change_second_phase\n\n# Print the final angle\nprint(final_angle)\n```\n\nRun the code above and you will find that the final angle from the ground to the sun, after both phases of movement, is \\(\\boxed{88}\\) degrees."
