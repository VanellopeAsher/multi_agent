  "problem": "On Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each. At the checkout, she got $3 off because she had voucher. The next day, the price increased to $25 per fruit, but the store also offered a 15% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 15 apples. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the apples on the two days?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each.

      "content": "To solve the problem of comparing the final prices paid on the two days, we'll calculate the total amount spent by Clara and Sheila, accounting for discounts or vouchers received, and then find the difference between these amounts.\n\n### Solution Plan:\n\n**For Clara:**\n1. Calculate the initial total cost of the apples.\n2. Subtract the voucher value from the total cost.\n\n**For Sheila:**\n1. Calculate the initial total cost of the apples at the increased price.\n2. Apply the percentage discount to find the amount saved.\n3. Calculate the final price paid after the discount.\n\nFinally, we'll calculate the difference between the two final amounts.\n\nLet's solve the problem using Python:\n\n```python\n# Your code\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Clara's purchase\nprice_per_apple_clara = 15\nnumber_of_apples_clara = 15\nvoucher_clara = 3\ntotal_cost_clara = price_per_apple_clara * number_of_apples_clara\nfinal_cost_clara = total_cost_clara - voucher_clara\n\n# Sheila's purchase\nprice_per_apple_sheila = 25\nnumber_of_apples_sheila = 15\ndiscount_sheila = Rational(15, 100)  # 15% discount\ntotal_cost_sheila = price_per_apple_sheila * number_of_apples_sheila\nfinal_cost_sheila = total_cost_sheila * (1 - discount_sheila)\n\n# Difference between final costs\ndifference = final_cost_sheila - final_cost_clara\n\n# Print result in fractional form\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nThe above code calculates the required difference using symbolic fractions to avoid decimals.
