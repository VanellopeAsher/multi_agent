  "problem": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to first determine the total cost of the jacket and shoes and then calculate how much money Sara needs to earn to reach that amount. After determining the initial amount Sara has and the amount she earns from babysitting, we can calculate how many times she needs to mow the lawn to cover the remaining cost. Let's follow Case 1 to write a Python program to solve this problem.\n\n```python\n# Importing necessary module\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Cost of the jacket and shoes\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost = 100\ntotal_shoe_cost = 2 * shoe_cost\ntotal_cost = jacket_cost + total_shoe_cost\n\n# Sara's initial amount and earnings\ninitial_savings = 100\nbabysitting_earnings = 10 * 5 # 10 times at $5 each\n\n# Total money Sara has before mowing the lawn\ntotal_initial_money = initial_savings + babysitting_earnings\n\n# Calculate how much more money Sara needs\namount_needed = total_cost - total_initial_money\n\n# Solve for the number of times Sara must mow the lawn\nmow_earnings_per_time = 10\nmow_times = symbols('mow_times')\nequation = Eq(mow_times * mow_earnings_per_time, amount_needed)\ntimes_to_mow = solve(equation, mow_times)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(times_to_mow)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we can determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn."
