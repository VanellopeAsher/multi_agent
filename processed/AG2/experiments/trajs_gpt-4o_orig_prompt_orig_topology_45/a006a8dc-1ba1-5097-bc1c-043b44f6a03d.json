In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

Each boy brings back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 60 = 600\n   \\]\n3. The amount of seashells brought by the girls is equal to the number brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys brought.\n\nLet's denote the number of seashells each girl brings as \\( x \\). Then, the total number of seashells brought by all the girls would be \\( 10x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n\\[\n10x = 600 + 4.5 \\times 600\n\\]\n\nNow let's solve this equation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = 10*x - (600 + 4.5*600)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code will give us the number of seashells brought by each girl.
