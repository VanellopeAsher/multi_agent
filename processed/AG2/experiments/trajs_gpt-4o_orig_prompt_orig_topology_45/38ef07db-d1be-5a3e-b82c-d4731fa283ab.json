You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nIn this scenario, the length of the fence is 20.5 feet and the width is 15.5 feet. So we need to substitute these values into the formula to find the total length of crepe paper required.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\n# Length and width of the fence\nlength = 20.5\nwidth = 15.5\n\n# Calculate perimeter\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(perimeter)\n```\n\nThe result is the total number of feet of crepe paper James needs to buy."
