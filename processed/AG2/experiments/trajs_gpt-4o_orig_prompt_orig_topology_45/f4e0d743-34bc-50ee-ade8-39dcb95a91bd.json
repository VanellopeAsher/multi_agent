You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog.

Then, we will sum up all of these expenses to find the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations:\n\n1. **Food Costs**:  \n   Madeline spends $25 per week on food.  \n   Since there are 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year, the yearly cost for food is:\n   \\[ 25 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\]\n\n2. **Treats Costs**:  \n   Treats cost $20 per month.  \n   The yearly cost for treats is:\n   \\[ 20 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\]\n\n3. **Medicine Costs**:  \n   Medicine costs $100 per month.  \n   The yearly cost for medicine is:\n   \\[ 100 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\]\n\n4. **Special Shampoo Costs**:  \n   The shampoo costs $15 per month.  \n   The yearly cost for the shampoo is:\n   \\[ 15 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\]\n\n5. **Toy Costs**:  \n   A toy costs $10 every two months.  \n   This means she buys 6 toys in a year, and the yearly cost for toys is:\n   \\[ 10 \\text{ dollars/toy} \\times 6 \\text{ toys/year} \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the total yearly cost by summing all of these components.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy for symbolic computation\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the variables\nweeks, months = symbols('weeks months')\n\n# Calculations\nfood_cost_year = 25 * 4 * 12\ntreats_cost_year = 20 * 12\nmedicine_cost_year = 100 * 12\nshampoo_cost_year = 15 * 12\ntoy_cost_year = 10 * 6\n\n# Total yearly cost\ntotal_cost_year = food_cost_year + treats_cost_year + medicine_cost_year + shampoo_cost_year + toy_cost_year\n\n# Output\nprint(total_cost_year)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we will find the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year."
