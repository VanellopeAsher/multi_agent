  "problem": "When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour than brfore. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

Calculate Billy's hourly wage after 1 year based on the given raises.\n2. Calculate Sally's hourly wage after 2 months based on the given conditions.\n3. Compute the total earnings for each after working 20 hours.\n4. Find the difference between Billy's and Sally's total earnings.\n\nLet's write Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Import the sympy library to utilize fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial hourly rate for Billy\nbilly_initial = Rational(10)\n# Billy's raise after 2 months\nbilly_after_2_months = billy_initial + Rational(0.5)\n# Billy's raise on his first anniversary\nbilly_after_1_year = billy_after_2_months + Rational(1)\n\n# Initial hourly rate for Sally\nsally_initial = billy_initial + Rational(0.5)\n# Sally's raise after 2 months\nsally_after_2_months = sally_initial + Rational(0.5)\n\n# Both work 20 hours\nhours_worked = 20\n\n# Earnings calculations\nbilly_earnings = billy_after_1_year * hours_worked\nsally_earnings = sally_after_2_months * hours_worked\n\n# Calculate the difference in earnings\ndifference = billy_earnings - sally_earnings\n\n# Print the difference\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally after working 20 hours."
