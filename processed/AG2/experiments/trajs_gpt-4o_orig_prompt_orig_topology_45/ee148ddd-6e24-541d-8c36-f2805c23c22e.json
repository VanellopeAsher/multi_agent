  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spent on activities and determine the time spent sightseeing based on the given percentage.\n\nHere's how we'll approach it:\n\n1. Calculate the total time John spent on all activities (excluding breaks and lunch).\n2. Identify what percentage of the total time the different activities represent.\n3. Calculate the amount of time spent sightseeing using the given percentage.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate the time John spent sightseeing based on these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for total time\ntotal_time = symbols('total_time')\n\n# John's activities:\nboating_time = 6  # hours\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2  # half the boating time\nwatching_time = 3 * 2  # 3 shows of 2 hours each\n\n# The time John spent watching shows is 30% of his total activity time\neq1 = Eq(watching_time, 0.3 * total_time)\n\n# Solve for total time\ntotal_activity_time = solve(eq1, total_time)[0]\n\n# Sightseeing is 40% of the total activity time\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_activity_time\n\n# Print the result in a fraction form\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\nprint(f\"Sightseeing time: {Rational(sightseeing_time).limit_denominator()} hours\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up and solves an equation to find the total time spent on activities and calculates the time spent sightseeing accordingly. It also uses SymPy to handle fractions instead of decimals, adhering to the problem constraints."
