You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWalter is collecting money for charity.

Walter collects $1500 from an online fund.\n3. Walter's lawyer donates three times as much as everyone else donates combined.\n4. Walter's lawyer donates $6600 in total.\n5. We need to find out how much Walter's friend contributed.\n\nTo find the friend's contribution, we can follow these steps:\n\n- Calculate the total amount collected by Walter and his friend (denoted as \\( x \\)).\n- The lawyer donates three times this total amount.\n- We are given the lawyer's contribution is $6600.\n- Use these facts to set up an equation and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's write this out as a linear equation and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n- Total donation by Walter and his friend = $500 (neighbors) + $1500 (online fund) + \\( x \\) (friend's contribution)\n- Amount matched by the lawyer = 3 Ã— (Total donation)\n- Lawyer's donation = $6600\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 6600 = 3 \\times (500 + 1500 + x) \\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\).\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this equation using SymPy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Total financial contribution (excluding the lawyer's)\ntotal_donation = 500 + 1500 + x\n\n# Equation setup\nequation = Eq(3 * total_donation, 6600)\n\n# Solve the equation\nfriend_donation = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the solution\nprint(friend_donation)\n```\n\nAfter solving this equation, we will find how much Walter's friend contributed.
