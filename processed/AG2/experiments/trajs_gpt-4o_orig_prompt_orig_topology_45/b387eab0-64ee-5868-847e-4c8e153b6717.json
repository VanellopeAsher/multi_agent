If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, and they have a coupon that offers a 10% discount on the total price after cashback, how much will they pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.

Calculate the initial cost of buying 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.\n2. Determine the total cashback received for 10 gallons.\n3. Subtract the cashback from the initial total cost to get the cost before applying the coupon.\n4. Apply the 10% coupon discount to this amount to determine the final cost.\n\n```python\n# Import the sympy package for symbolical calculations\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Parameters\nprice_per_gallon = Rational(3, 1)  # $3.00 per gallon\ncashback_per_gallon = Rational(20, 100)  # $.20 cashback per gallon\ngallons_bought = 10  # gallons\ncoupon_discount = Rational(10, 100)  # 10%\n\n# Calculate initial total cost\ninitial_cost = price_per_gallon * gallons_bought\n\n# Calculate total cashback\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons_bought\n\n# Calculate cost after cashback\ncost_after_cashback = initial_cost - total_cashback\n\n# Apply coupon discount\nfinal_cost = cost_after_cashback * (1 - coupon_discount)\n\n# Output the final cost\nprint(final_cost)\n```\n\nRun this code to find the final cost after applying both the cashback and the coupon discount."

The cashback for 10 gallons is \\(0.20 \\times 10 = 2\\) dollars.\n3. The cost after cashback is \\(30 - 2 = 28\\) dollars.\n4. With a 10% coupon discount on this cost: \\(28 \\times 0.10 = 2.8\\) dollars.\n5. The final cost is \\(28 - 2.8 = 25.2\\) dollars, which in fractional form is \\(\\frac{126}{5}\\).\n\nThus, the customer will pay \\(\\boxed{\\frac{126}{5}}\\) dollars."
