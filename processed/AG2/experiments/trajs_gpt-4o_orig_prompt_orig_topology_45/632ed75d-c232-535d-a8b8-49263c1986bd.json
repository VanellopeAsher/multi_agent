  "problem": "There are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "This problem can be solved using reasoning and some simple arithmetic calculations, so it falls under Case 2. Let's break down the problem step-by-step to solve it.\n\n1. Determine the total number of flights performed by the first aircraft. Since 44 flights by the second aircraft represent half of the flights of the first aircraft, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total flights by first aircraft} = 2 \\times 44 = 88\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how many of the first aircraft's flights are to Greece. The problem states that 3/4 of the flights of the first aircraft go to Greece:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flights to Greece} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute the remaining number of flights for the first aircraft to allocate between France and Germany:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining flights} = 88 - 66 = 22\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide the remaining flights evenly between France and Germany. Since the remaining 22 flights are evenly divided:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flights to France} = \\text{Flights to Germany} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."
