You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost based on the prices of the gallon and half-gallon jars. Here's the key idea:\n\n1. We know that the cost of a gallon jar is $5.5.\n2. The cost of a gallon jar is $2.5 more than the cost of a half-gallon jar. Let's set up an equation to find the cost of the half-gallon jar.\n3. Once we have both prices, we'll calculate the total cost for 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.\n\nLet's solve this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for the cost of a half-gallon jar\nhalf_gallon_cost = symbols('half_gallon_cost')\n\n# The cost of a gallon jar is $5.5\ngallon_cost = 5.5\n\n# The cost of a gallon jar is $2.5 more than the cost of a half-gallon jar\nequation = Eq(gallon_cost, half_gallon_cost + 2.5)\n\n# Solve for the half_gallon_cost\nhalf_gallon_cost_value = solve(equation, half_gallon_cost)[0]\n\n# Calculate the total cost for 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars\ntotal_cost = 10 * gallon_cost + 16 * half_gallon_cost_value\n\n# Output the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow let's continue with the calculations."
