You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $15.00 each and a ballpen at $5.00 each.

This falls under Case 1: We can solve it directly with Python code.\n\nHere's how we'll solve it:\n\n1. Determine the cost of the notebooks: Multiply the number of notebooks (50) by the price of each notebook ($15.00).\n2. Determine the cost of the ballpens: Multiply the number of ballpens (10) by the price of each ballpen ($5.00).\n3. Add the costs from both products to get the total amount spend.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Prices of items\nnotebook_price = 15.00\nballpen_price = 5.00\n\n# Quantities purchased\nnotebooks_bought = 50\nballpens_bought = 10\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = (notebooks_bought * notebook_price) + (ballpens_bought * ballpen_price)\n\n# Output total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the total amount William spent."
