You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAli has some $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

Define variables:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of $10 bills Ali has.\n   - Ali also has six $20 bills.\n\n2. Write the equation for the total amount of money:\n   - The total amount of money \\( T \\) that Ali has is given by:\n     \\[\n     T = 10x + 6 \\times 20\n     \\]\n     Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     T = 10x + 120\n     \\]\n\n3. Ali gives half of the total money to his sister:\n   - After giving money to his sister, the remaining amount is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining} = \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\n     \\]\n\n4. Ali uses \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the remaining money for dinner:\n   - The amount spent on dinner is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Dinner} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{10x + 120}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. After buying dinner, Ali has $32 left:\n   - The equation for the remaining money after dinner is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10x + 120}{2} - \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{10x + 120}{2} = 32\n     \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python to find \\( x \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx = symbols('x')\nT = 10*x + 120\nremaining_half = T / 2 \ndinner_expense = (3/5) * remaining_half\nremaining_after_dinner = remaining_half - dinner_expense\n\nequation = Eq(remaining_after_dinner, 32)\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\nnum_10_bills = solution[0]\n\nprint(num_10_bills)\n```\n\nThis code will solve for the number of $10 bills Ali originally had."
