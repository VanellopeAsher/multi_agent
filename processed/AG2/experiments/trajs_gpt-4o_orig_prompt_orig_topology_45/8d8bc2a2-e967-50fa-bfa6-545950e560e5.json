That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nGeorge needs to pay for dental work.

Then, we'll calculate how many hours George needs to work at his hourly wage to cover the remaining amount. Let's proceed with the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the implants.\n2. Subtract the deposit.\n3. Determine how many hours he needs to work to pay the remaining amount.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the prices\nbase_price_per_implant = 2000.5\nextra_cost_for_crown = 500.5\ndeposit_paid = 600\nhourly_wage = 15.3\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = 2 * base_price_per_implant + extra_cost_for_crown\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount after deposit\nremaining_amount = total_cost - deposit_paid\n\n# Step 3: Determine the number of hours needed to pay the remaining amount\nhours_needed = remaining_amount / hourly_wage\n\n# Print the result, showing fractions if applicable\nfrom sympy import Rational, ceiling\n\n# Use Rational to maintain fractions\nremaining_amount_fraction = Rational(remaining_amount.as_integer_ratio()[0], remaining_amount.as_integer_ratio()[1])\nhourly_wage_fraction = Rational(hourly_wage.as_integer_ratio()[0], hourly_wage.as_integer_ratio()[1])\n\n# Calculate the hours needed using fractions\nhours_needed_fraction = remaining_amount_fraction / hourly_wage_fraction\n\n# Ceiling to ensure we have enough hours (since partial hours may not be allowed in actual work)\nhours_needed_ceiling = ceiling(hours_needed_fraction)\n\nprint(hours_needed_ceiling)\n```\n\nThis code calculates how many complete hours George needs to work to afford the dental work after considering his deposit."
