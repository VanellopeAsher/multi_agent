You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we can set up some equations to represent the information given and solve for the unknown quantities.\n\nKey Idea:\n- We know that the mural used 12 pints of paint in total.\n- Half of the total amount, which is yellow paint, means that yellow paint is 6 pints.\n- The remaining amount of paint (12 total - 6 yellow) is split equally between red, white, and purple.\n\nLet's use Python and the sympy package to solve this problem.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Total amount of paint\ntotal_paint = 12\n\n# Half of the paint is yellow\nyellow_paint = total_paint / 2\n\n# Let x be the amount of red, white, and purple paint\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation: the sum of yellow paint and 3 times the amount of x equals the total paint\nequation = Eq(yellow_paint + 3 * x, total_paint)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nred_paint = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(red_paint)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the number of pints of red paint used in the mural. The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal. The code evaluates the amount of one of these colors, which is the required solution."
