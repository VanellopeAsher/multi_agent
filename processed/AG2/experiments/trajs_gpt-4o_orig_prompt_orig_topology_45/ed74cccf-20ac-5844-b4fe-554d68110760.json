You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThere are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of students based on the given information about the students playing different sports. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Tennis**: There are 6 students playing tennis.\n2. **Volleyball**: Twice the number of students playing volleyball than tennis, so that's \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) students playing volleyball.\n3. **Soccer**: We know there are 22 girls, but we need to find the total number of students playing soccer, which includes both boys and girls. Let's denote the number of boys playing soccer as \\(b\\). Then the total number of students playing soccer is \\(b + 22\\).\n\nAdding all these groups together gives us the total number of students:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total students} = 6 \\text{ (tennis)} + 12 \\text{ (volleyball)} + (b + 22) \\text{ (soccer)} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total students} = 18 + b + 22 = 40 + b \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students depends on the number of boys, \\(b\\), playing soccer.\n\nSince we know every student is involved in only one of these sports, let's write a Python program to confirm the steps and total.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nb = symbols('b')\n\n# Total number of students equation\ntotal_students = 6 + 12 + (b + 22)\n\n# Display the expression for total students\nprint(total_students)\n```\n\nThis program correctly reflects the expression \\(40 + b\\) as the total number of students. If you know the number of boys (\\(b\\)), you can substitute it to find the exact total number of students. If \\(b\\) is unspecified, then:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40 + b}\n\\]"
