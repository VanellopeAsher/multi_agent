You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent solving both a normal sudoku puzzle and an extreme sudoku puzzle, then calculate how many half-hour intervals fit into that total time. We can solve this directly with Python.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the time spent on a normal sudoku.\n2. Calculate the time spent on an extreme sudoku.\n3. Add these times to get the total time.\n4. Divide the total time by the length of each interval (0.5 hours) to find how many bottles of water John drinks.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Time spent on a normal sudoku\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30  # minutes\n\n# Time spent on an extreme sudoku\nextreme_sudoku_time = 3 * normal_sudoku_time  # minutes\n\n# Total time in minutes\ntotal_time = normal_sudoku_time + extreme_sudoku_time\n\n# Total time in hours\ntotal_time_in_hours = total_time / 60\n\n# Number of half-hour intervals\nbottles_of_water = total_time_in_hours / 0.5\n\n# Print the result\nprint(int(bottles_of_water))\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of bottles of water John drinks in that time."
