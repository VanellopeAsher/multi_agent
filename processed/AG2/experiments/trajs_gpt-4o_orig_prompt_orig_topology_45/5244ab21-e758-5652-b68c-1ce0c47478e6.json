You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Mrs. Harrington started with a dozen boxes of oranges, each containing 20 oranges:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total initial oranges} = 12 \\times 20 = 240\n   \\]\n\n2. She gave away 2 boxes each to her mother and sibling, which totals 4 boxes. So, the remaining boxes are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining boxes} = 12 - 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. The number of oranges left after gifting:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges remaining} = 8 \\times 20 = 160\n   \\]\n\n4. She retained a quarter of the remaining oranges for herself:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges retained} = \\frac{160}{4} = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally, the number of oranges she sold is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oranges sold} = 160 - 40 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mrs. Harrington sold \\(\\boxed{120}\\) oranges."
