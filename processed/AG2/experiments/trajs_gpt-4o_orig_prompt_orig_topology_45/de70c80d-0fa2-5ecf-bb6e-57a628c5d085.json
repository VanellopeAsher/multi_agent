You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it.

We'll calculate the number of letters step by step according to the description of her writing process.\n\nKey Idea: We'll break down Elise's writing process and calculate the total number of letters based on the description.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the number of letters Elise writes when she writes the alphabet three times.\n2. Calculate the number of letters when she writes half of the alphabet once.\n3. Sum the results of the first two steps to find the total number of letters Elise initially writes.\n4. Re-calculate the total, considering she rewrites everything she initially wrote.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Semantics for the 3 initial alphabet writings\ntotal_initial_writing = 3 * 26  # Elise writes the full alphabet 3 times\ntotal_initial_writing += 26 / 2  # Plus half of the alphabet once\n\n# Semantics for re-writing everything\ntotal_letters_written = total_initial_writing * 2  # Re-write everything\n\n# Output the result\nfrom sympy import Rational\nprint(Rational(total_letters_written))\n```\n\nRunning the code will give you the total number of letters Elise wrote in fractional form."

Elise writes the full alphabet (26 letters) three times, which equals \\(3 \\times 26 = 78\\) letters.\n2. She then writes half of the alphabet once, which is \\( \\frac{26}{2} = 13\\) letters.\n3. The total letters written initially are \\(78 + 13 = 91\\) letters.\n4. She rewrites everything she initially wrote, so she writes an additional \\(91\\) letters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters Elise writes in total is \\(91 + 91 = 182\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{182}\\)."
