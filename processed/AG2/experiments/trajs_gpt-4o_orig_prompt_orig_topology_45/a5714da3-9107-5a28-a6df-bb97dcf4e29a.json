You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.

We can use Python to perform this calculation.\n\nKey idea to solve the problem:\n- Case 1: The problem can be solved with Python code directly by summing up the costs of the different items Scarlett purchased.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# cost of the aquarium\naquarium_cost = 10.00\n\n# cost of 2 bags of rocks\nrocks_cost = 2 * 2.50\n\n# cost of 3 pieces of coral\ncoral_cost = 3 * 2.00\n\n# fish costs (not given, assume fish are free for the sake of this calculation)\n# fish_cost = 0.00 (or it'll be included if not zero)\n\n# cost of fish food\nfish_food_cost = 2.00\n\n# total cost\ntotal_cost = aquarium_cost + rocks_cost + coral_cost + fish_food_cost\n\n# print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nEvaluating this will give us the total amount Scarlett spent. Let's calculate.\n\n```python\n# calculated cost\ntotal_cost = 10.00 + 2 * 2.50 + 3 * 2.00 + 2.00\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThe output will be the total amount Scarlett spent.
