      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the depth of the water in the tank on Thursday based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step and use Python to assist with any necessary calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Monday's depth:** The initial depth of the tank on Monday is given as 17 feet.\n  \n2. **Tuesday's depth:** On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than it had on Monday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tuesday's depth} = \\text{Monday's depth} + 7 = 17 + 7 = 24 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Wednesday's depth:** On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wednesday's depth} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{Tuesday's depth} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Wednesday's depth:** We'll use Python to compute this value.\n\n5. **Thursday's depth:** On Thursday, the tank's water depth increased by half of the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase on Thursday} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{Tuesday's depth} - \\text{Wednesday's depth})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Thursday's depth} = \\text{Wednesday's depth} + \\text{Increase on Thursday}\n   \\]\n\n### Python Code to Perform Calculations\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Initial depths\nmonday_depth = 17\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + 7\n\n# Calculate Wednesday's depth using rational arithmetic\nwednesday_depth = Rational(2, 3) * tuesday_depth\n\n# Calculate the increase on Thursday\nincrease_thursday = Rational(1, 2) * (tuesday_depth - wednesday_depth)\n\n# Calculate Thursday's depth\nthursday_depth = wednesday_depth + increase_thursday\n\n# Output Thursday's depth in exact form\nprint(thursday_depth)\n```\n\nLet's compute Wednesday's depth and increase on Thursday, then find the depth on Thursday using these results.\n\nUpon executing this code, you will find:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20 \\text{ feet}}\n\\]\nThis is the depth of the water in the tank on Thursday."
