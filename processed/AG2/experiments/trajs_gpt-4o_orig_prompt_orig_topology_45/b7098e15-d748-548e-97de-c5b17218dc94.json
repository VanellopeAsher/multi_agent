  "problem": "Billy is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days, how many people does he help? After helping people, Billy also decides to take a 15-minute break every hour to drink a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine. He also spends 30 minutes each day to organize his paperwork.  (Remember there are 31 days in March.)",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.
