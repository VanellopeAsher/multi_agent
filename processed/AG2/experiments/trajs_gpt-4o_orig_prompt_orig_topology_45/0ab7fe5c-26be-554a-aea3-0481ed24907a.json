You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. If Jackson buys 3.6 times of ten red tulips and 2.4 times of ten blue tulips, how many rows of flowers will he plant?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll determine the number of red and blue tulips Jackson buys, find out how many of each type of tulip fit in one row, and then calculate the total number of rows required for each type of tulip.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of red tulips by multiplying 3.6 times ten by 10.\n2. Calculate the total number of blue tulips by multiplying 2.4 times ten by 10.\n3. Divide the total number of red tulips by 6 to find how many rows of red tulips can be planted.\n4. Divide the total number of blue tulips by 8 to find how many rows of blue tulips can be planted.\n5. Sum the results to get the total number of rows.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Calculate the number of tulips\nred_tulips = Rational(3.6 * 10)\nblue_tulips = Rational(2.4 * 10)\n\n# Calculate the number of rows for each type of tulip\nrows_red = red_tulips / 6\nrows_blue = blue_tulips / 8\n\n# Sum the total number of rows\ntotal_rows = rows_red + rows_blue\n\n# Print the results\nprint(total_rows)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you will get the total number of rows Jackson needs to plant both red and blue tulips."
