You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

Sum the costs of scotch and cognac to find the total amount spent.\n\nWe'll use Python and a library to keep the fractions exact for this calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, symbols, solve\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the cost per bottle of scotch\ntotal_cost_scotch = 600\nnum_bottles_scotch = 10\n\ncost_per_bottle_scotch = total_cost_scotch / num_bottles_scotch\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of bottles of cognac and their cost per bottle\nnum_bottles_cognac = 2 * num_bottles_scotch\ncost_per_bottle_cognac = cost_per_bottle_scotch * (1 + Rational(1, 2))  # 50% more per bottle\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total cost spent on cognac\ntotal_cost_cognac = num_bottles_cognac * cost_per_bottle_cognac\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent on everything\ntotal_amount_spent = total_cost_scotch + total_cost_cognac\n\nprint(total_amount_spent)\n```\n\nNow let's continue with the calculations:\n\n```python\n# Output the boxed result\nfrom sympy import latex\nfrom sympy import simplify\n\n# Output the final result in a boxed format\nprint(f\"\\\\boxed{{{latex(simplify(total_amount_spent))}}}\")\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we should get the total amount John spends on everything."
