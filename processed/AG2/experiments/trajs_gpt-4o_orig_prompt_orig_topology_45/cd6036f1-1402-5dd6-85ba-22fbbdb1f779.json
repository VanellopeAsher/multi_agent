You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month.

We'll set up the equation that describes Mark's weight changes over the months.\n\nKey Steps:\n1. Let \\( x \\) be Mark's initial weight before he fell ill.\n2. During the illness phase, he lost \\( 10 \\) pounds per month for \\( 3 \\) months. This implies a total loss of \\( 30 \\) pounds.\n3. During the recovery phase, he gained \\( 5 \\) pounds per month for \\( 2 \\) months. This implies a total gain of \\( 10 \\) pounds.\n4. After these changes, his final weight is \\( 70 \\) pounds.\n\nWe can set up the equation based on these changes and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nHere's the Python code using sympy to solve the equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable for initial weight\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation setup: initial weight - weight lost + weight gained = final weight\nequation = Eq(x - 30 + 10, 70)\n\n# Solve the equation\ninitial_weight = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the initial weight\nprint(initial_weight[0])\n```\n\nThis code sets up Mark's weight transition through mathematical equation and calculates the initial weight."

The solution to the problem is indeed that Mark's initial weight was \\( \\boxed{90} \\) pounds. \n\nHere's a quick breakdown of how we reached this answer with the equation:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be Mark's initial weight.\n2. Subtract the total weight lost during the illness: \\( x - 30 \\).\n3. Add the total weight regained during recovery: \\( x - 30 + 10 \\).\n4. Set this equal to his final weight of 70 pounds: \\( x - 30 + 10 = 70 \\).\n5.
