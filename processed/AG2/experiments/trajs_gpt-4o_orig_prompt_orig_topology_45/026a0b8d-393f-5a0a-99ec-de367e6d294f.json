She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

Let's define variables and then solve the problem using Python and the sympy library to handle the algebra.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe have two types of seeds: tomato and celery. We know:\n- The cost of a packet of tomato seeds is \\$40.\n- The cost of a packet of celery seeds is \\$30.\n- Mrs. Rylan bought a total of 80 packets of celery seeds.\n- The total amount of money spent is \\$3200.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of packets of tomato seeds Mrs. Rylan bought.\n\nWe can set up the following equations based on the given conditions:\n1. \\( 40x + 30 \\times 80 = 3200 \\)\n\nWe will solve this linear equation for \\( x \\) to find out how many packets of tomato seeds were bought. Let's write the Python code to do this using sympy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem statement\ntotal_cost = 40 * x + 30 * 80\nequation = Eq(total_cost, 3200)\n\n# Solve for x\ntomato_packets = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'The number of packets of tomato seeds bought is: {tomato_packets}')\n```\n\nLet's run this code to find the solution."
