  "problem": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4.5 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

Calculate the cost per pack of bacon.\n2. Determine the cost per packet of chicken.\n3. Calculate the total cost for the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples in the cart.\n4. Subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left.\n\nI'll write a Python program to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total cost for 5 packs of bacon\ntotal_bacon_cost = Rational(21, 2) # 10.5 in fraction form\ncost_per_bacon_pack = total_bacon_cost / 5\n\n# Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon\ncost_per_chicken_packet = 2 * cost_per_bacon_pack\ntotal_chicken_cost = 6 * cost_per_chicken_packet\n\n# Each pack of strawberries costs $4.5\ncost_per_strawberry_pack = Rational(9, 2)\ntotal_strawberry_cost = 3 * cost_per_strawberry_pack\n\n# Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries\ncost_per_apple_pack = cost_per_strawberry_pack / 2\ntotal_apple_cost = 7 * cost_per_apple_pack\n\n# Calculate total cost of all groceries\ntotal_cost = total_bacon_cost + total_chicken_cost + total_strawberry_cost + total_apple_cost\n\n# Kelly's budget\nbudget = Rational(65)\n\n# Calculate remaining budget\nremaining_budget = budget - total_cost\n\nprint(remaining_budget)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget."
