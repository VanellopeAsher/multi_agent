You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.

Calculate the total money Jayden currently has.\n2. Calculate the amount Ava gave him by dividing her allowance in half.\n3. Add the money from selling pictures and the amount Ava gave.\n4. Determine the total amount of money Jayden needs and calculate the total cost of the camera.\n\nLet's proceed with the Python code:\n\n```python\n# Jayden's money from selling pictures\nmoney_from_pictures = 70\n\n# Ava's allowance and the amount she gave to Jayden\navas_allowance = 90\nava_gave = avas_allowance / 2\n\n# Total money Jayden currently has\ntotal_current_money = money_from_pictures + ava_gave\n\n# Additional money needed\nadditional_needed = 85\n\n# Total cost of the camera\ntotal_camera_cost = total_current_money + additional_needed\n\n# Output the total cost in a box\nprint(f\"The total cost of the camera is \\\\boxed{{{total_camera_cost}}}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will compute the total cost of the camera."
