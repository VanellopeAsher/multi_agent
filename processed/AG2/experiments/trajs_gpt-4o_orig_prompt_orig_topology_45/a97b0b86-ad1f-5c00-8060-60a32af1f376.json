You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes of pizza that Marie ordered. We can set up an equation based on the total cost of all the items Marie ordered. This will be solved using algebraic methods with Python's sympy package.\n\n**Key Idea**: We will calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples, then set up an equation for the total cost including the pizza. Then, we will solve for the number of boxes of pizza.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.\n2. Set up the equation with the total given and solve for the number of pizza boxes.\n\nLet's proceed with the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the number of pizza boxes as a symbol\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Calculate the total cost of chicken meal, milk and apples\nchicken_cost = 12\nmilk_cost = 5 * 3.5\napple_cost = 4 * 1.5\n\n# Total of known items\nknown_item_total = chicken_cost + milk_cost + apple_cost\n\n# Set up the equation for total cost\npizza_cost_per_box = 8.5\ntotal_cost = 52.5\n\n# Equation: known_item_total + pizza_cost_per_box * x = total_cost\nequation = Eq(known_item_total + pizza_cost_per_box * x, total_cost)\n\n# Solve for x (number of pizza boxes)\nnumber_of_pizza_boxes = solve(equation, x)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"The number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is: {number_of_pizza_boxes[0]}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. The result will be displayed in exact form using the print function, adhering to the initial problem requirements."
