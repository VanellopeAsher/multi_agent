You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEmil is 21 years old now.

Let's go through this step-by-step.\n\n### Key Idea\nWe'll use algebraic equations to capture the relationships described in the problem:\n\n1. Let \\( E \\) be Emil's current age, which is given as 21.\n2. Let \\( D \\) be Emil's dad's current age.\n3. Let \\( B \\) be Emil's brother's current age.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- When Emil is 26, he will be half the age of his dad. Thus, we can express this as:\n  \\[\n  26 = \\frac{1}{2}(D + 5)\n  \\]\n  Here, \\( D + 5 \\) is Emil's dad's age when Emil is 26.\n  \n- When Emil is 26, he will be twice the age of his brother:\n  \\[\n  26 = 2(B + 5)\n  \\]\n  Here, \\( B + 5 \\) is Emil's brother's age when Emil is 26.\n\nLet's solve this system of equations using Python with the 'sympy' package.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nD, B = symbols('D B')\n\n# Emil is 21 now\nE = 21\n\n# Set up the equations\neq1 = Eq(26, (D + 5) / 2)  # Emil is half his dad's age\neq2 = Eq(26, 2 * (B + 5))  # Emil is twice his brother's age\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (D, B))\n\n# Calculate the sum of the ages of dad and brother\nsum_of_ages = solution[D] + solution[B]\nprint(f\"Solution: Dad's age = {solution[D]}, Brother's age = {solution[B]}\")\nprint(f\"Sum of Dad's and Brother's ages: {sum_of_ages}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the solution and, thereby, the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother."
