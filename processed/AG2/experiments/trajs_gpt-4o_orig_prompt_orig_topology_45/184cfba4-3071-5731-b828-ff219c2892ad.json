You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll use Python for the calculations. We'll follow Case 3 and work through the problem step by step, identifying any calculations that need to be done.\n\n1. Define the known values from the problem:\n   - Let \\( s \\) represent the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n   - Let \\( l \\) represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n   - Each small stuffed animal costs $40.\n   - Large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones, so each large costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) dollars.\n   \n2. Set up the equations based on the problem:\n   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones: \\( s = 2l \\).\n   - The total earnings from sales is $1200: \\( 40s + 120l = 1200 \\).\n\n3. Solve the equations to find \\( s \\).\n\nLet's perform the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\ns, l = symbols('s l')\n\n# Equation for twice as many small stuffed animals as large\neq1 = Eq(s, 2 * l)\n\n# Equation for total sales amount\neq2 = Eq(40 * s + 120 * l, 1200)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (s, l))\n\n# Retrieve the number of small stuffed animals\nsmall_stuffed_animals = solution[s]\n\nprint(small_stuffed_animals)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold. Once you run the code, you will find the value of \\( s \\), which is the number of small stuffed animals sold."
