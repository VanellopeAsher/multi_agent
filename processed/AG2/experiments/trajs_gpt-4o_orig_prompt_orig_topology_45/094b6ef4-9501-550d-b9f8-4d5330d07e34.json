You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the length of the shark based on the given relationship between the shark and the remoras. Here's how to approach it:\n\nKey Idea: \nWe are given that the length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's length. We can set up an equation based on this information.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1. We know that each remora is 6 inches long. Therefore, the combined length of the two remoras is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) inches.\n2. The problem states that this combined length (12 inches) is 10% of the shark's body length.\n3. Let \\( x \\) be the length of the shark in inches. We can write the equation based on the given 10% relationship:\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times x = 12\n   \\]\n4. Solve for \\( x \\), the shark's length.\n\nThis problem can be solved using Python because it's a straightforward linear equation. Let's write the Python code to solve it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Combined length of the remoras\nremora_length = 12  # in inches\n\n# Equation: 10% of shark's length equals the remoras' length\nequation = Eq(0.10 * x, remora_length)\n\n# Solve the equation\nshark_length = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# Print the shark's length\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `sympy` package to symbolically solve the equation for the shark's length. Once you run this code, you will get the length of the shark, placed inside a Python `print` statement."
