He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces, and anther one that had 125 pieces than the 500 piece one.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.

Since this calculation can be done directly, we will proceed with Case 1 and write a Python program to solve it.\n\n1. We know the first box has 500 pieces.\n2. The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one. So it has \\(500 \\times 3 = 1500\\) pieces.\n3. The third box has \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the pieces of the first one. So it has \\(\\frac{500}{4} = 125\\) pieces.\n4. The fourth box has 125 more pieces than the first one. So it has \\(500 + 125 = 625\\) pieces.\n\nNow, we'll add all these amounts to find the total number of pieces picked up:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the number of pieces in each lego box\npieces_set_1 = 500\npieces_set_2 = pieces_set_1 * 3\npieces_set_3 = pieces_set_1 / 4\npieces_set_4 = pieces_set_1 + 125\n\n# Compute the total number of pieces\ntotal_pieces = pieces_set_1 + pieces_set_2 + pieces_set_3 + pieces_set_4\n\n# Output the result in fraction form (not decimal)\nprint(total_pieces)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give you the total number of pieces Johnny picks up."
