You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nKatarina has 5 less cookies than Max has.

Let \\( C \\) represent the number of cookies that the Cookie Monster has.\n2. Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster, which means:  \n   \\( M = 1.2 \\times (C + 10) \\).\n3. Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max, which means:  \n   \\( K = M - 5 \\).\n4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, which means:  \n   \\( S = M + 23 \\).\n5. It's given that Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies, which can be calculated directly:  \n   \\( K = 6.8 \\times 10 \\).\n6. Calculate \\( C \\) using the equation from Katarina's cookies:  \n   Substitute the value of \\( K \\) from step 5 into the equation from step 3 and solve for \\( C \\).\n7. Use the value of \\( C \\) to find \\( M \\) and \\( S \\) from steps 2 and 4.\n8.
