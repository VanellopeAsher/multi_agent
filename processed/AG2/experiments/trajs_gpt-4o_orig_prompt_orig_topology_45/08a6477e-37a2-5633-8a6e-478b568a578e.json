      "content": "To solve this problem, we will carefully keep track of the number of bandages the nurses have and use each day. We need to calculate how many bandages they used on the first day. Let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write Down the Known Information:**\n   - Initial bandages on the first day: 19\n   - Bandages ordered on the first day: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)\n   - Bandages ordered on the third day: 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages)\n   - Bandages used on the second day: 10 fewer than the first day\n   - On the third day, they use half a pack, which means 25 bandages.\n   - Bandages left at the end of the third day: 78\n\n2. **Setup the Equation:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of bandages used on the first day.\n   - Then the bandages used on the second day is \\( x - 10 \\).\n   - The total number of bandages they receive during the three days is \\( 19 + 50 + 100 = 169 \\).\n   - The total number of bandages used over the three days is \\( x + (x - 10) + 25 \\).\n   - At the end of the third day, they have 78 bandages left.\n\n3. **Equation for the Total Bandages:**\n   - The equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     169 - (x + (x - 10) + 25) = 78\n     \\]\n   - Simplify and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nHere's the code using Python and Sympy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Declare the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation based on the problem description\ntotal_bandages_start = 19 + 50 + 100\nbandages_left = 78\nused_bandages_total = x + (x - 10) + 25\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = Eq(total_bandages_start - used_bandages_total, bandages_left)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\nprint(solution[0])\n```\n\nThis code sets up the equation based on the problem's constraints and solves for \\( x \\), which represents the number of bandages used on the first day. The output will be the value of \\( x \\).\n\nLet's solve it to find how many bandages were used on the first day."
