You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nLeah just got a new kitten.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total cost in a straightforward manner by adding up the costs of spaying, discounted vaccines, and broken vases.\n\nHereâ€™s how we will solve it:\n1. Calculate the cost of spaying.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the vaccines and apply a 10% discount.\n3. Calculate the cost of the 4 broken vases.\n4. Add these costs together to get the total cost.\n\nLet's write a Python program to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Cost calculations\nspaying_cost = 200\nvaccine_cost_per_dose = 20\nnumber_of_vaccines = 3\n\n# Calculate total vaccine cost before discount\ntotal_vaccine_cost = vaccine_cost_per_dose * number_of_vaccines\n\n# Apply 10% discount on vaccines\nvaccine_discount = Rational(10, 100)  # 10% as a fraction\ndiscounted_vaccine_cost = total_vaccine_cost * (1 - vaccine_discount)\n\n# Cost of broken vases\nvase_cost_per_unit = 12\nnumber_of_broken_vases = 4\ntotal_vase_cost = vase_cost_per_unit * number_of_broken_vases\n\n# Calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = spaying_cost + discounted_vaccine_cost + total_vase_cost\n\n# Output in fraction form\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nBy running this code, we calculate and express the costs without using decimals, maintaining exact fractions where applicable. Let's execute the code to get the answer."

Cost for 3 vaccines at $20 each: \\(3 \\times 20 = 60\\).\n3. Discount on vaccine total cost: 10% of $60 is $6. So, the discounted vaccine cost becomes \\(60 - 6 = 54\\).\n4. Cost for 4 broken vases at $12 each: \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\).\n\nNow, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 200 + 54 + 48\n\\]\n\nFinally, compute the total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 302\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost is \\(\\boxed{302}\\)."
