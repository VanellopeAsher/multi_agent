You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Miss Maria has and then subtract the cards she keeps to find out how many cards she gives to her students. By dividing the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives, we can determine the number of students.\n\nLet's go through the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards.\n3. Add the special soccer cards.\n4. Subtract the amount of cards that Miss Maria keeps.\n5. Divide the remaining cards by the number each student receives to find the number of students.\n\nWe will use Python to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Import sympy to allow us to use fractions\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Total number of basketball cards\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n\n# Total number of baseball cards\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n\n# Total number of soccer cards\nsoccer_cards = 30\n\n# Total number of cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards + soccer_cards\n\n# Miss Maria keeps 50 cards\ncards_kept = 50\n\n# Calculate the number of cards Miss Maria gives to students\ncards_given_to_students = total_cards - cards_kept\n\n# Each student gets 10 cards\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Calculate the number of students\nnumber_of_students = cards_given_to_students / cards_per_student\n\n# Print the result using a fraction representation\nprint(Rational(number_of_students))\n```\n\nThis program calculates the required number of students.
