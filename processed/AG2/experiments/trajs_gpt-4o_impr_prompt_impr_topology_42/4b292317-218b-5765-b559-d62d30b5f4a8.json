Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Determine the Length of the First Cuts**: \n   - The original ribbon is 10,000 millimeters long.\n   - Marty cuts this ribbon into 40 equal parts.\n   - Therefore, each of the first cuts has a length of `10,000 mm / 40`.\n\n2. **Determine the Length of the Final Cuts**:\n   - Each of the first cuts is further divided into 50 equal parts.\n   - Hence, each of the final cuts is `length of one of the first cuts / 50`.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Original length of the ribbon in millimeters\ntotal_length_mm = 10000  \n\n# Cutting the ribbon into 40 equal parts\nfirst_cut_length_mm = total_length_mm / 40  \n\n# Each of the first cuts is divided into 50 equal parts\nfinal_cut_length_mm = first_cut_length_mm / 50  \n\n# Print result\nprint(final_cut_length_mm)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
