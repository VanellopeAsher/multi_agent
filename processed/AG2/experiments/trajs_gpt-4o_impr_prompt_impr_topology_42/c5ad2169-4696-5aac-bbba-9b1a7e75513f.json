Fish tank: Scarlett purchased the fish tank for $10.00.\n2. Stones: She bought two packets of stones, each costing $2.50. \n   - Total cost for stones = 2 packets × $2.50 = $5.00\n3. Coral pieces: She purchased three coral pieces, each priced at $2.00.\n   - Total cost for coral pieces = 3 pieces × $2.00 = $6.00\n4. Fish: She bought 20 fish, each priced at $0.50.\n   - Total cost for fish = 20 fish × $0.50 = $10.00\n5. Fish food: She bought a packet of fish food for $2.00.\n\nNow, add up all these costs to find the total amount Scarlett spent:\n\n- Fish tank: $10.00\n- Stones: $5.00\n- Coral pieces: $6.00\n- Fish: $10.00\n- Fish food: $2.00\n\n**Total amount spent = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00**\n\nScarlett spent a total of $33.00. \n\nWould you like to discuss or verify this solution?"
