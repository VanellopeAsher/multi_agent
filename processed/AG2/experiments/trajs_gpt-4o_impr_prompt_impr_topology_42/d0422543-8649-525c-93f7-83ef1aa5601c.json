Let \\( S \\) represent the son's age.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n- Carver's age \\( C = 60 \\).\n- Carver's age is 8 years less than twice his son's age.\n\nThis mathematical relationship can be expressed in the equation:\n\n\\[ C = 2S - 8 \\]\n\nSince we already know Carver's age is 60, we can substitute \\( C \\) with 60:\n\n\\[ 60 = 2S - 8 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( S \\):\n\n1. Add 8 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( S \\) on one side:\n\n   \\[ 60 + 8 = 2S \\]\n\n   \\[ 68 = 2S \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( S \\):\n\n   \\[ S = \\frac{68}{2} \\]\n\n   \\[ S = 34 \\]\n\nThus, the son's age is 34 years."
