Therefore, he runs \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours on each of these days.\n\n3. **Total Time Spent Running Per Week**:\n   - Total time on the first day = 3 hours.\n   - Total time on the other two days = 1.5 hours/day Ã— 2 days = 3 hours.\n   - Total running time for the week = 3 hours (first day) + 3 hours (second and third days) = 6 hours.\n\n4. **Weekly Running Speed**:\n   - Total distance run in a week = 60 miles.\n   - Total time spent running = 6 hours.\n   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\n\n**Conclusion**: John's running speed is 10 miles per hour.\n\nNow let's ensure there are no oversights by discussing this approach."

Let's break down the problem step-by-step in the code:\n\n- Calculate John's total running hours per week based on his weekly schedule.\n- Use the total distance run and total time spent running to calculate his average speed.\n\nI'll write the code now to confirm this:\n\n```python\n# Total distance John runs in a week\ntotal_distance_week = 60  # miles\n\n# Time spent running\ntime_first_day = 3  # hours\ntime_other_days = time_first_day / 2  # hours per day\n# Total time spent running in the week\ntotal_time_week = time_first_day + 2 * time_other_days  # 3 + 2*1.5 = 6 hours\n\n# Average speed\naverage_speed = total_distance_week / total_time_week  # miles per hour\n\nprint(average_speed)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
