Colby's total money is calculated as $3.45 using his given coins.\n2. To find out how many gumballs can be purchased, we need the cost of a single gumball.\n3. Both agents assumed a hypothetical price, but we need the specific actual price to provide a complete answer.\n\nAt this point, without the cost of a single gumball, the problem cannot be conclusively solved.
