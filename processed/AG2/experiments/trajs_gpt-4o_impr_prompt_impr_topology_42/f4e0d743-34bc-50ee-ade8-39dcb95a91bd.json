      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total annual cost of all the items that Madeline purchases for her dog.\n\n1. **Calculate the annual cost of food:**\n   - Food costs $25 per week.\n   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost is \\( 25 \\times 4 = 100 \\) dollars.\n   - Hence, the annual cost (12 months) is \\( 100 \\times 12 = 1200 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the annual cost of treats:**\n   - Treats cost $20 per month.\n   - Hence, the annual cost is \\( 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the annual cost of medicine:**\n   - Medicine costs $100 per month.\n   - Hence, the annual cost is \\( 100 \\times 12 = 1200 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the annual cost of shampoo:**\n   - Shampoo costs $15 per month.\n   - Hence, the annual cost is \\( 15 \\times 12 = 180 \\) dollars.\n\n5. **Calculate the annual cost of toys:**\n   - A toy costs $10 every two months.\n   - In a year there are \\( 12 / 2 = 6 \\) periods of two months.\n   - Hence, the annual cost is \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\) dollars.\n\n6. **Calculate the total annual cost:**\n   - Add up all the annual costs: \n   \\[\n   1200 \\, (\\text{food}) + 240 \\, (\\text{treats}) + 1200 \\, (\\text{medicine}) + 180 \\, (\\text{shampoo}) + 60 \\, (\\text{toy}) = 2880 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Madeline spends $2880 per year on her dog."
