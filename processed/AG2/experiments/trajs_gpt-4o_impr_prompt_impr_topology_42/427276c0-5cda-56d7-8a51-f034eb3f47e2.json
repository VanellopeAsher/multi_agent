      "content": "To find the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of women**: There are three women wearing 4.5-inch heels and another three women wearing 2.5-inch heels, making a total of \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) women.\n\n2. **Calculate the total heel height contributed by each group**:\n   - The total height for the women wearing 4.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5\\) inches.\n   - The total height for the women wearing 2.5-inch heels is \\(3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\) inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the total heel height for all women**:\n   - Add the height contributions from both groups: \\(13.5 + 7.5 = 21\\) inches.\n\n4. **Calculate the average heel height**:\n   - Divide the total heel height by the number of women: \\(\\frac{21}{6} = 3.5\\) inches.\n\nSo, the average height of heels at the party is 3.5 inches."

Determining the total number of women as 6.\n2. Calculating the total height contributed by the women wearing 4.5-inch heels (13.5 inches) and 2.5-inch heels (7.5 inches).\n3. Finding the total heel height (21 inches).\n4. Dividing the total heel height by the number of women to get the average height (3.5 inches).\n\nEvery step adheres to the provided information and leads us to the correct answer.\n\nThus, I can conclude confidently:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3.5}**"
