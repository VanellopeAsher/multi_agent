At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.

In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we can break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Brownies made by Greta:**\n   - She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.\n   - 1 dozen is equivalent to 12 brownies.\n\n2. **Brownies from the office party:**\n   - She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office.\n   - 1/2 dozen is equivalent to 6 brownies.\n\n3. **Brownies from the surprise party:**\n   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies for the surprise party.\n   - 4 dozen is equivalent to \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) brownies.\n\n4. **Total number of brownies Greta had in total:**\n   - Combine all the brownies she received:\n   - Total brownies = 12 (self-made) + 6 (office party) + 48 (surprise party) = 66 brownies.\n\n5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**\n   - 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.\n   - 1 1/2 dozen is equivalent to \\(1.5 \\times 12 = 18\\) brownies.\n\n6. **Calculate the remaining brownies:**\n   - Remaining brownies = Total brownies - Brownies eaten\n   - Remaining brownies = 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.\n\nThus, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
