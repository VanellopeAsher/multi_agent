      "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow the given steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of basketball cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards each.\n   - Total basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of baseball cards:**\n   - She has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards each.\n   - Total baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of cards she initially has:**\n   - Total cards = Total basketball cards + Total baseball cards = 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards.\n\n4. **Subtract the cards Miss Maria keeps:**\n   - Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of cards she gives to the students:**\n   - Cards given to students = Total cards - Cards kept by Miss Maria = 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards.\n\n6. **Determine how many students received the cards:**\n   - Each student gets 10 cards.\n   - Number of students = Cards given to students / Cards per student = 300 cards / 10 cards per student = 30 students.\n\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
