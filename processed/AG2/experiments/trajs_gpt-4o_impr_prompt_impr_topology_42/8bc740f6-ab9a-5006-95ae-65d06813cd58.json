      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem statement:\n\n1. The first news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles daily.\n2. The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.\n3. February has 2.8 times of ten days. We take 10 days * 2.8 = 28 days because February can have 28 days.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the number of articles the first website publishes in February:**\n   - Average daily articles = 20\n   - Number of days in February = 28\n   - Total articles by the first website in February = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles\n\n2. **Calculate the number of articles the sister company publishes in February:**\n   - Average daily articles = 10\n   - Number of days in February = 28\n   - Total articles by the sister company in February = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles\n\n3. **Total articles published by both websites together:**\n   - Total articles by both = 560 articles (first website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles\n\nTherefore, the two websites together published a total of 840 articles in February.\n\nLet's discuss and ensure this solution is consistent with any alternative approaches or additional insights that might come up."
