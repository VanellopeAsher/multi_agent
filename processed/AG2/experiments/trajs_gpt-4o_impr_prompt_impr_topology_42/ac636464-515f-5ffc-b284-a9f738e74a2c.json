His new speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{New speed} = \\frac{3 \\text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1.5 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThe time to swim the remaining 9 miles at this speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time for remaining 9 miles} = \\frac{9 \\text{ miles}}{1.5 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Time**\n\nThe total time to get across the lake includes the time spent swimming the initial segment, the rest time, and the time spent swimming the final segment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = 7 \\text{ hours} + 3.5 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 16.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, it took James a total of 16.5 hours to swim across the lake."
