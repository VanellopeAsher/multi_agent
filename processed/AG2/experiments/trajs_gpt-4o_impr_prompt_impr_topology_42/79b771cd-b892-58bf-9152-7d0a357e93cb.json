Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum safe distance that Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\nHere's how to approach the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Base Throw Distance**: \n   - Normally, Polly can throw the javelin 4000 feet.\n\n2. **Effect of the Sapphire Gemstone**:\n   - The problem states that holding the sapphire gemstone allows Polly to throw the javelin three times farther. \n   - Therefore, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is \\(3 \\times 4000\\) feet.\n\n3. **Calculating the Reach with the Gemstone**:\n   - Calculating the enhanced throw distance:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, Polly can throw the javelin 12,000 feet when holding the gemstone.\n\n4. **Determining the Safe Distance Beyond Dragon's Flames**:\n   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 10,000 feet.\n   - We want to find out how far beyond this distance Polly can stand and still hit the dragon.\n   - Since Polly can throw the javelin 12,000 feet, she could stand:\n     \\[\n     12000 \\text{ feet (throw distance)} - 10000 \\text{ feet (flame reach)} = 2000 \\text{ feet outside the reach of the flames}\n     \\]\n   \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Polly can safely stand 2,000 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\nThus, Polly can stand 2,000 feet beyond the dragon's flame reach and still hit the dragon with the javelin when using the gemstone empowerment. Now, let's discuss these findings with the other agents."
