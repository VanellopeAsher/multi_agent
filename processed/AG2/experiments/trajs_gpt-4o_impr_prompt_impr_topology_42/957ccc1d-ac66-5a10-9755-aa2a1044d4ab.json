      "content": "To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Total Weight Loss Required**: Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Calories to Burn for the Target Weight Loss**: Since burning 1 pound of body weight requires a calorie deficit of approximately 3500 calories, the total calorie deficit needed is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ lbs} \\times 3500 \\text{ calories/lb} = 105,000 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Time Frame for Weight Loss**: The time between December 31st and July 19th is about 6 months and 19 days. We can break this down into days:\n   - January: 31 days\n   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)\n   - March: 31 days\n   - April: 30 days\n   - May: 31 days\n   - June: 30 days\n   - July: 19 days\n   - Total: 200 days\n\n4. **Calculate Daily Calorie Deficit**:\n   Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{105,000 \\text{ calories}}{200 \\text{ days}} = 525 \\text{ calories/day}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th."

To lose 1 pound, he needs a deficit of 3500 calories.\n3. Therefore, for 30 pounds, he needs a total deficit of \\(30 \\times 3500 = 105,000\\) calories.\n4. The time period from December 31st to July 19th is 200 days.\n5. Dividing the total calories by the number of days gives a daily calorie deficit of \\(\\frac{105,000}{200} = 525\\) calories.\n\nBoth solutions are consistent. Thus, the final verified daily calorie deficit Andy needs is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{525}**"
