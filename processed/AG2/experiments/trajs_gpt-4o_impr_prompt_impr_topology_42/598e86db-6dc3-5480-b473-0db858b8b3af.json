      "content": "To find out how many people Billy helps per hour, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Days:**\n\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April has 19 days up to April 19th.\n\n   Total days between March 1st and April 19th = \\(31 + 19 = 50\\) days.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days Billy Takes Off:**\n\n   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.\n\n   Number of days off = \\(20\\%\\) of 50 days = \\(0.20 \\times 50 = 10\\) days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Billy Works:**\n\n   - Number of working days = Total days - Days off = \\(50 - 10 = 40\\) days.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Hours Billy Works:**\n\n   - Billy works 3 hours per day.\n\n   Total hours = \\(3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 40 \\text{ days} = 120\\) hours.\n\n5. **Find How Many People Billy Helps Per Hour:**\n\n   - Billy helps a total of 240 people over 120 hours.\n\n   Number of people helped per hour = \\(\\frac{240 \\text{ people}}{120 \\text{ hours}} = 2\\) people per hour.\n\nThus, Billy helps 2 people per hour."

Billy has a total of 50 days from March 1st to April 19th (31 days in March and 19 days in April).\n2. He takes off 20% of these days, which comes out to 10 days off (20% of 50).\n3. Therefore, he works for 40 days (50 total days - 10 days off).\n4. He works for 3 hours each day, making it a total of 120 hours (40 working days Ã— 3 hours per day).\n5. He helps a total of 240 people in this duration.\n6. Therefore, the number of people he helps per hour is 2, calculated by dividing 240 people by 120 hours.\n\nHence, both manual calculation and code execution confirm the result that Billy helps 2 people per hour.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2}**"
