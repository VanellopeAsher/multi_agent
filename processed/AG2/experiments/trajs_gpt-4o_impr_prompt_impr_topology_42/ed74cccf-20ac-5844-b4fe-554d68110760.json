      "content": "To solve the problem, we'll break down and calculate the total number of students engaged in each activity, and then sum them up to find the total number of students.\n\n1. **Identify the Groups Involved:**\n   - Tennis Players: 6 students\n   - Volleyball Players: Twice the number of tennis players, which is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) students\n   - Soccer Players: The total number of soccer players is the sum of boys and 22 girls. Since we don't have the number of boys, we'll denote the number of boys as \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Establish the Equation for Total Students:**\n   - Total students can be represented by adding all individual groups together. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = \\text{Tennis Players} + \\text{Volleyball Players} + \\text{Soccer Players}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values, the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 6 + 12 + (b + 22)\n     \\] \n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 18 + (b + 22) = b + 40\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without the specific number of boys (denoted by \\( b \\)) playing soccer, we cannot find the exact total number of students. However, the relation given is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = b + 40\n     \\]\n\n   So, the total number of students depends on the number of boys involved in soccer. Further information about the number of boys is required to provide a numerical answer."

Since Python doesn't inherently handle operations between different data types, attempting to add an integer with a string leads to an error. Let's adjust our code to correctly formulate the relation in terms such as Python's symbolic computation with SymPy, which will allow us to express \\( b \\) symbolically.\n\nI'll correct this by using SymPy to manage the symbolic representation of 'b'. Let me fix that and re-run the calculation. \n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\n# Define the boys_soccer_players as a symbolic variable\nb = symbols('b')\n\n# Number of students playing tennis\ntennis_players = 6\n\n# Number of students playing volleyball\nvolleyball_players = 2 * tennis_players  # Twice the number of tennis players\n\n# Number of students playing soccer\ngirls_soccer_players = 22\n\n# Total students, expressed with SymPy symbolic algebra\ntotal_students = tennis_players + volleyball_players + girls_soccer_players + b\n\n# Displaying the total in terms of b\nresult = f\"Total students = {total_students} (where 'b' is the number of boys playing soccer)\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will display the total number of students as a symbolic expression, correcting the previous error.
