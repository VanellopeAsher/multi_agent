      "content": "To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Elliott's Total Steps Goal**: Elliott's daily goal is to walk 10,000 steps.\n\n2. **Calculate Completed Steps**:\n   - Elliott completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is \\( \\frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \\) steps.\n   - Elliott took another 1,000 steps going on a short walk with his friend.\n   - Elliott took 500 steps while shopping.\n\n3. **Determine Remaining Steps**: After his jog, Elliott realized he had 2,000 steps left to take.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Steps Prior to Jog**:\n   - The total number of steps Elliott took before the jog is:\n     \\[\n     5,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 6,500 \\text{ steps}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Steps Taken After Jog**: Since Elliott had 2,000 steps remaining after his jog:\n   - Steps he aimed to walk (10,000) minus completed steps (8,000) is:\n     \\[\n     10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \\text{ steps taken so far after jog}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Steps Taken During the Jog**:\n   - To find the steps taken during the jog, subtract the pre-jog total (6,500 steps) from the post jog total (8,000 steps):\n     \\[\n     8,000 - 6,500 = 1,500 \\text{ steps}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Elliott took 1,500 steps during his jog."
