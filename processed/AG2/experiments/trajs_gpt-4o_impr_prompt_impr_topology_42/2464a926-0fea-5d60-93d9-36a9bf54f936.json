Determine the total number of sets of balloons prepared.\n   - Jolene and her friends prepared 10 sets of balloons.\n\n2. Determine how many balloons are in each set.\n   - Each set contains 30 balloons.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of balloons initially prepared.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Balloons Prepared} = \\text{Number of Sets} \\times \\text{Balloons per Set} = 10 \\times 30 = 300\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine the number of balloons remaining at the end of the water balloon fight.\n   - There are 12 balloons remaining.\n\n5. Calculate the number of balloons used.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons Used} = \\text{Total Balloons Prepared} - \\text{Balloons Remaining} = 300 - 12 = 288\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jolene and her friends used 288 balloons in their water balloon fight."
