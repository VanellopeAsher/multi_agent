Using the given dimensions:\n- Long side = 20.5 feet\n- Short side = 15.5 feet\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n1. Calculate the sum of the dimensions: \\( 20.5 + 15.5 = 36 \\) feet.\n2. Multiply the sum by 2 to get the perimeter: \\( 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\) feet.\n\nThus, James needs to buy 72 feet of crepe paper.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{72}**"
