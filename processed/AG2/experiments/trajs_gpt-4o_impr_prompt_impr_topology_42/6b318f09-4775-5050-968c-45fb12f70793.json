      "content": "To determine how many people show up at Martha's party, we'll break down the problem into a series of steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Invitees**: The first step is to calculate the total number of people invited by Martha.\n   - For the 12 families with 6 people each:  \n     \\[ 12 \\text{ families} \\times 6 \\text{ people/family} = 72 \\text{ people} \\]\n   \n   - For the 15 families with 4 people each:  \n     \\[ 15 \\text{ families} \\times 4 \\text{ people/family} = 60 \\text{ people} \\]\n\n   - Thus, the total number of people invited is:  \n     \\[ 72 + 60 = 132 \\text{ people} \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the People Unable to Attend Due to Illness**: According to the problem, 16 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we have:\n   \\[ 16 \\text{ people couldn't attend due to illness} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the People Unable to Attend Due to Previous Commitments**: It is mentioned that 1/4 of those unable to attend due to illness had previous commitments.\n   - 1/4 of 16 is:  \n     \\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4 \\text{ people} \\]\n\n4. **Total People Who Couldn't Attend**: Sum up the people who couldn't attend due to illness and previous commitments:\n   \\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \\text{ people} \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Attendees**: Subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of invitees:\n   \\[ 132 - 20 = 112 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nThus, **112 people** show up for Martha's party.\n\nI'll now discuss this approach with the other agents to double-check the steps and conclusion."
