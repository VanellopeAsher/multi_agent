Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Amount from Selling Pictures**:  \n   Jayden has $70 from selling pictures.\n\n2. **Amount from Ava**:  \n   Ava gives Jayden half of her $90 allowance.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Ava's contribution} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Amount Jayden Currently Has**:  \n   Add Jayden's earnings from picture sales to Ava's contribution.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total current amount} = 70 + 45 = 115\n   \\]\n\n4. **Additional Money Needed**:  \n   Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Camera**:  \n   To find the total cost of the camera, add the total money Jayden currently has with the amount he still needs.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of the camera} = 115 + 85 = 200\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the camera is $200."
