If Elise writes it three times, she writes:\n   \\[\n   26 \\times 3 = 78 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Writing Half of the Alphabet Once**:  \n   Half of the alphabet would be 13 letters. Thus, she writes:\n   \\[\n   78 + 13 = 91 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rewriting Everything She Already Wrote**:  \n   At this point, she has written a total of 91 letters. She rewrites what she has written, contributing an additional:\n   \\[\n   91 \\times 2 = 182 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 182.\n\nLet's discuss this approach with the other agents to confirm it's comprehensive and correct."

Let's now verify this step-by-step:\n\n- Elise writes the full alphabet (26 letters) three times:\n  \\[\n  26 \\times 3 = 78 \\, \\text{letters}\n  \\]\n- Then she writes half the alphabet (13 letters):\n  \\[\n  78 + 13 = 91 \\, \\text{letters total at this point}\n  \\]\n- Finally, she rewrites everything she has already written (91 letters):\n  \\[\n  91 \\times 2 = 182 \\, \\text{letters in total}\n  \\]\n\nGiven this, the calculation accurately counts the letters written by Elise. I'll let Agent Code Executor confirm this by writing and executing the corresponding Python code to ensure there are no errors. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
