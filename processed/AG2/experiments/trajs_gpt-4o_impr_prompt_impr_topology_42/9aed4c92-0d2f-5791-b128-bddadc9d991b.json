      "content": "To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money to buy the bike, we need to figure out the total amount of money required and how much money he earns per day. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Initial Savings**: Mark currently has $50.5 in his bank account.\n2. **Cost of the Bike**: The bike costs $300.5.\n3. **Additional Money Needed**: To find out how much more money Mark needs, we subtract his current savings from the cost of the bike:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional Money Needed} = \\$300.5 - \\$50.5 = \\$250\n   \\]\n\n4. **Daily Earnings**: Mark earns $12.5 per day.\n5. **Days Required to Earn Additional Money**: To compute how many days he needs to earn the additional $250, we divide the additional money needed by his daily earnings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Days Required} = \\frac{\\$250}{\\$12.5} = 20 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\nSo, Mark needs to work for 20 more days at his job to be able to afford the bike. \n\n**Discussion**: This calculation assumes that Mark does not have any other expenses during this period, and he is saving every dollar he earns towards the bike. If there are other financial considerations, such as daily expenses, the number of days required could be longer."
