      "content": "To find the shark's length based on the information given, we can follow these simple steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Combined Length of the Remoras**: It is provided that each remora is 6 inches long, and there are two such remoras. Thus, their combined length is: \n   \\[\n   6 \\, \\text{inches} + 6 \\, \\text{inches} = 12 \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate the Length of the Remoras to the Shark's Length**: The problem states that the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) is 10% of the shark's body length. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shark's length} \\times 0.10 = 12 \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation**: To find the shark's body length, divide both sides of the equation by 0.10:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shark's length} = \\frac{12 \\, \\text{inches}}{0.10} = 120 \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the shark is 120 inches long. Let's discuss this solution to ensure clarity or if there are alternative approaches."

Both approaches correctly calculate the shark's length using the information that the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. \n\nHere's a summary of the calculation:\n\n1. The combined length of the remoras is \\(12\\) inches.\n2. This combined length represents \\(10\\%\\) of the shark's total length.\n3. By setting up the equation: \\(0.10 \\times \\text{Shark's Length} = 12\\) and solving it, we derive the shark's length as \\(120\\) inches.\n\nThis is validated by the Python code execution, which also results in a shark length of \\(120\\) inches.\n\nTherefore, the final length of the shark is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{120}**"
