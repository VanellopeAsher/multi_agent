      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much protein John receives from eating 300 grams of mushrooms daily and then calculate the total amount of protein for the entire week. Here is the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Protein to Weight Ratio**:  \n   From the problem statement, we know that 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein.\n\n2. **Calculate Protein in 300 Grams of Mushrooms**:  \n   Since John consumes 300 grams of mushrooms daily, which is double the weight of 150 grams, he would consume double the protein found in 150 grams.\n   \n   Hence, the protein content in 300 grams is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Protein in 300 grams} = 2 \\times 4 \\, \\text{grams} = 8 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Weekly Protein Intake**:\n   If John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, he consumes 8 grams of protein daily. Over the course of 7 days (a week), his total protein intake is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly protein intake} = 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n\nThus, John gets 56 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms. I look forward to discussing this with the team."

Here is a verification of their solution:\n\n- From the given information, 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein.\n- John eats 300 grams of mushrooms daily, which is twice the initial amount. This implies the protein consumed daily is \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) grams.\n- Over a week (7 days), the total protein consumption is \\(8 \\times 7 = 56\\) grams.\n\nThe calculations have been validated and confirmed through Python code execution, providing consistent results.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{56}**"
