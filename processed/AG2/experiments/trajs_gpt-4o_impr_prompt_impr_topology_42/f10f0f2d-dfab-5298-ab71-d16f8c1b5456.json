      "content": "To determine how much money Gerald has left, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Gerald's Earnings:**\n   - Gerald earns $30 every day he works at the daycare.\n   - A week typically has 7 days, so we calculate his earnings from the daycare as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from daycare} = 30 \\, \\text{dollars/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 210 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Earnings from Babysitting:**\n   - It is stated that Gerald babysat his neighbor's kids for 2 hours each day at the rate of $0.\n   - Therefore, his total earnings from babysitting is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from babysitting} = 0 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 0 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Earnings:**\n   - Adding up his earnings from both activities gives us:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total earnings} = 210 \\, \\text{dollars} + 0 \\, \\text{dollars} = 210 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Subtract Expenses:**\n   - Gerald spent $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n   - We subtract his expenses from his total earnings to find how much money he has left:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Money left} = 210 \\, \\text{dollars} - 100 \\, \\text{dollars} = 110 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Gerald has $110 left after his expenses."
