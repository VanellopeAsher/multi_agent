Calculate the total amount of time spent doing various activities, excluding sightseeing.\n   - Boating: 6.6 hours\n   - Swimming: 6.6 / 2 = 3.3 hours\n   - Watching shows: 3 shows * 2.5 hours each = 7.5 hours\n\n2. Sum up the time spent on activities to find the total percentage:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total activity time (excluding sightseeing)} = 6.6 + 3.3 + 7.5 = 17.4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Given that this constitutes 30% of the total vacation time, we can calculate the total vacation time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total vacation time} = \\frac{17.4\\ \\text{hours}}{0.30} = 58 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the time spent sightseeing which is 40% of his total holiday time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent sightseeing} = 58 \\text{ hours} \\times 0.40 = 23.2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nJohn spent 23.2 hours sightseeing during his vacation."

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is validated as correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{23.2}**"
