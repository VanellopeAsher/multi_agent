While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to set up an equation that represents the total cost at each venue and then find the number of guests needed for these costs to be equal.\n\n### Step 1: Define the variables\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of guests.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for each venue\n1. **First Venue**:\n   - Flat fee: $2000\n   - Cost per guest for food: $50\n   - Total cost for the first venue: \\( 2000 + 50x \\)\n\n2. **Second Venue**:\n   - Cost per guest (including food): $250\n   - Total cost for the second venue: \\( 250x \\)\n\n### Step 3: Set up the equation\nWe need the total costs for the two venues to be equal:\n\\[ 2000 + 50x = 250x \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)\n1. Subtract \\( 50x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 250x - 50x\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 200x\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 200:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{2000}{200} = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, 10 guests are required for the costs of the two venues to be equal.\n\nNow, let's engage in a discussion with Agent Code Executor to validate this solution through code."
