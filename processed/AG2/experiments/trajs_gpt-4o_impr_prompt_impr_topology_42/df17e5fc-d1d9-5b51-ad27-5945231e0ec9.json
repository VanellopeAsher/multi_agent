      "content": "To find out how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Paint Used in Mural:**  \n   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.\n\n2. **Paint Distribution:**  \n   - Half of the mural is yellow.\n   - The remaining half is equally divided among red, white, and purple paints.\n\n3. **Calculate Yellow Paint:**  \n   - If half of the mural is yellow, then the yellow paint used is 50% of the total paint.\n   - Therefore, yellow paint used = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\) pints = 6 pints.\n\n4. **Calculate Remaining Paint for Red, White, and Purple:**  \n   - After accounting for the yellow paint, the remaining paint is for red, white, and purple.\n   - Remaining paint = Total paint - Yellow paint = 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints.\n\n5. **Equal Amounts of Red, White, and Purple:**  \n   - Since the remaining paint is equally split between red, white, and purple, we divide the remaining paint equally among these three.\n   - Paint per color (red, white, or purple) = \\( \\frac{6}{3} \\) pints = 2 pints.\n\n6. **Result:**  \n   - Therefore, 2 pints of red paint were used in the mural.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further explanations or if there are any more questions!"

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.\n2. Half of this is yellow paint, so 6 pints are used for yellow.\n3. The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among red, white, and purple, which are the other three colors.\n4. Since these remaining 6 pints are equally divided, each color (red, white, and purple) gets \\( \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\) pints.\n\nBoth the reasoning and the code confirm that the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2}**"
