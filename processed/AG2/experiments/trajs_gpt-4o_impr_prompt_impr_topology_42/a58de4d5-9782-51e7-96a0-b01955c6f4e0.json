To concoct 1 jar of this special mixture, he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. He also adds 0.5 pounds of a secret ingredient, which is actually just water and doesn't cost him anything. The passion fruit is priced at $6 per pound, the jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and the honey is a bit more expensive at $10 per pound. Despite the high cost of ingredients, he manages to sell each jar for $50. If he sells 10 jars of his special mixture, how much profit does he make?",

      "content": "To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam blend, we must first calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then extend that to 10 jars. Here's how we can compute it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Cost of Ingredients for One Jar:**\n   - **Passion Fruit Cost**: \n     - 2 pounds × $6 per pound = $12\n   - **Jackfruit Cost**: \n     - 1.5 pounds × $8 per pound = $12\n   - **Honey Cost**: \n     - 2 pounds × $10 per pound = $20\n   - The secret ingredient (water) is free.\n\n   Adding these up gives us the total cost for one jar:\n   \\[\n   \\$12 + \\$12 + \\$20 = \\$44\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Revenue from Selling One Jar:**\n   - Each jar is sold for $50.\n\n3. **Calculate the Profit per Jar:**\n   - Profit per jar = Selling price per jar - Cost per jar\n   - Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Profit for Selling 10 Jars:**\n   - Profit for 10 jars = Profit per jar × Number of jars\n   - Profit for 10 jars = $6 × 10 = $60\n\nTherefore, Tim makes a total profit of $60 from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam blend."
