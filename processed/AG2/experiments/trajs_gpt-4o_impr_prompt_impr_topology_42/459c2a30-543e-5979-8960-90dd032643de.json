      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of white squares based on the given relationships between the colored squares on Brittany's quilted comforter.\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Each Colored Squares**:\n   - **Red squares**: Brittany has 14 red squares.\n   - **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is \\(14 + 4 = 18\\).\n   - **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is \\(18 + 6 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Colored Squares**:\n   - Combine the number of red, blue, and green squares: \n     \\[\n     14 \\text{ (red)} + 18 \\text{ (blue)} + 24 \\text{ (green)} = 56 \\text{ colored squares}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of White Squares**:\n   - Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet. Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, there are 68 squares in total.\n   - The number of white squares is the total number of squares minus the total number of colored squares:\n     \\[\n     68 \\text{ (total squares)} - 56 \\text{ (colored squares)} = 12 \\text{ white squares}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate How Much Fewer the White Squares Are Than Green Squares**:\n   - The number of green squares is 24, and the number of white squares is 12.\n   - Therefore, the white squares are fewer than green squares by:\n     \\[\n     24 - 12 = 12\n     \\]\n\nThus, Brittany's quilted comforter has 12 fewer white squares than green squares."
