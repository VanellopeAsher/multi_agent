  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

Given:\n\n- Total budget: €1500\n- Costs of the items she buys:\n  - Computer setup: €1090\n  - Scanner: €157\n  - CD burner: €74\n  - Printer: €102\n\nThe steps and calculations by Agent Problem Solver are correct:\n\n1. Calculate the total spent:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the remaining budget:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining budget} = 1500 - 1423 = 77\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Elvira will have left to spend on her new outfit is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{77}**"
