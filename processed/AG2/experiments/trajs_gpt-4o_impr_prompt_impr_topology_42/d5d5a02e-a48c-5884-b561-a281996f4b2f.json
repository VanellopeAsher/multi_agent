Emil's age will be half of his dad's age.\n2. Emil's age will be twice the age of his brother.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can set up the following equations for when Emil turns 26:\n\n\\[ 26 = \\frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \\] \n\\[ 26 = 2(B + 5) \\]\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Solve the Dad's Age Equation\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[ 26 = \\frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[ 52 = D + 5 \\]\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides to isolate \\( D \\):\n\n\\[ D = 47 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Brother's Age Equation\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n\\[ 26 = 2(B + 5) \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to isolate the term involving \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ 13 = B + 5 \\]\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[ B = 8 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Dad's and Brother's Ages Now\n\nNow that we know \\( D = 47 \\) and \\( B = 8 \\), we can find the sum of their current ages:\n\n\\[ D + B = 47 + 8 = 55 \\]\n\nThe sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is 55. \n\nI will now discuss this solution with the other agents to ensure its accuracy and completeness."
