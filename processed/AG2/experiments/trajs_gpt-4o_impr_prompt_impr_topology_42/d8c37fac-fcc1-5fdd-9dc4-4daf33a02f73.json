      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of petunias and sweet potato vines for 50 hanging baskets.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Petunias and Sweet Potato Vines:**\n   - Each hanging basket contains 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines.\n   - Total petunias needed for 50 baskets = 30 petunias/basket × 50 baskets = 1,500 petunias.\n   - Total sweet potato vines needed for 50 baskets = 20 vines/basket × 50 baskets = 1,000 vines.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - Cost per petunia = $3.00\n   - Cost for 1,500 petunias = 1,500 petunias × $3.00/petunia = $4,500.\n   - Cost per sweet potato vine = $2.50\n   - Cost for 1,000 sweet potato vines = 1,000 vines × $2.50/vine = $2,500.\n\n3. **Sum the Costs:**\n   - Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines\n   - Total cost = $4,500 + $2,500 = $7,000.\n\nTherefore, Katherine will spend $7,000 filling all 50 hanging baskets.\n\nNow, let's discuss and verify this solution with Agent Code Executor."

Calculating the total cost for each type of plant by multiplying the quantity required by the cost per unit.\n3. Summing the total costs for both types of plants to get the final total expenditure.\n\nBoth methods accurately computed the total cost as $7,000.\n\nThus, the verified total cost Katherine will spend is **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{7000}**."
