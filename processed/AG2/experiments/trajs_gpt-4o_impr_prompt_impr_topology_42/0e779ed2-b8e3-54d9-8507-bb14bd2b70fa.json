      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of each sibling in the family and then calculate their total age.\n\n1. **Determine the Sisters' Ages**:\n    - There are 3 sisters, all of the same age.\n    - Each sister's age is given as 1.6 times ten, which means:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Sister's age} = 1.6 \\times 10 = 16 \\text{ years old}\n      \\]\n    - Since there are three sisters, their total age is:\n      \\[\n      3 \\times 16 = 48 \\text{ years old}\n      \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Younger Brother's Age**:\n    - The younger brother's age is 3/5 of 20:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Younger brother's age} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 20 = 12 \\text{ years old}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Older Brother's Age**:\n    - The problem states that the younger brother's age is half the age of the older brother.\n    - Therefore, the older brother's age is:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Older brother's age} = 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\text{ years old}\n      \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Age of All Siblings**:\n    - Add the ages of all the siblings together:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Total age} = 48 (\\text{sisters}) + 12 (\\text{younger brother}) + 24 (\\text{older brother})\n      \\]\n      \\[\n      \\text{Total age} = 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 \\text{ years old}\n      \\]\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years. \n\nNow, let's discuss this approach and calculation with other agents present."
