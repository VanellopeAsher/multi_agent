      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Equal Share**: Amora and Lainey both received 700 corn chips each. Therefore, the equal share for two people is 700 corn chips.\n\n2. **Determine Collins's Share**: It's given that the third person, Collins, received 150 more corn chips than the equal share. Since Amora and Lainey's share is 700 corn chips each, Collins received:\n   \\[\n   700 + 150 = 850 \\text{ corn chips}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Corn Chips**: To find the total number of corn chips, you'll add up the chips that each person received:\n   \\[\n   700 \\text{ (Amora)} + 700 \\text{ (Lainey)} + 850 \\text{ (Collins)} = 2250 \\text{ corn chips}\n   \\]\n\nThus, there were 2250 corn chips altogether."
