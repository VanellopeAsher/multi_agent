Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \\( T \\). According to the problem:\n\\[\n0.30 \\times T = 15\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( T \\):\n\\[\nT = \\frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the time spent sightseeing, subtract the time spent on other activities (15 hours) from the total vacation time:\n\\[\n\\text{Sightseeing time} = T - 15 = 50 - 15 = 35 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John spent 35 hours sightseeing."

The problem and calculations were analyzed as follows:\n\n- John spends 6 hours boating and 3 hours swimming.\n- He spent 6 hours watching shows, making a total of 15 hours on these activities.\n- Since 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time, his total vacation time is calculated by \\(\\frac{15}{0.3} = 50\\) hours.\n- Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is \\(50 - 15 = 35\\) hours.\n\nThe solutions are consistent and correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{35}**"
