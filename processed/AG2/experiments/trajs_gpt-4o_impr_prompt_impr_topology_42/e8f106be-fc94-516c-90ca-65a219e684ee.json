His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

      "content": "To tackle this problem, we need to determine the number of feet of crepe-paper streamers required to decorate James's backyard fence. The key here is to calculate the perimeter of the fence since James wants to hang streamers around it.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the shape of the backyard**: The fence forms a rectangle.\n\n2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle**: \n   - Long side (Length) = 20 feet\n   - Short side (Width) = 15 feet\n\n3. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle**:\n   - The formula to calculate the perimeter (\\(P\\)) of a rectangle is:\n     \\[\n     P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the given values:\n     \\[\n     P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Consider other elements in the yard**: \n   - The problem states that James does not want to hang streamers on the tree. However, since streamers are only being hung on the fence, the tree does not affect the amount of crepe-paper needed.\n\n5. **Result**: \n   - James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe-paper streamers to hang around his fence.\n\nThe streamers will only be required for the boundary defined by the fence, and potential obstacles like the tree, which is not part of the perimeter, do not affect this calculation. Thus, the total amount of streamers required is 70 feet."

The tree in the middle of the yard is not a factor in this calculation, as the streamers are only being used for the perimeter of the fence."
