This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch.

Let me compute the time John spent sightseeing using a Python script, based on the problem description.\n\n```python\n# Boating time\nboating_time = 6  # in hours\n\n# Swimming time is half of boating\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2\n\n# Watching shows time\nshows_time = 3 * 2  # 3 shows, 2 hours each\n\n# Total time spent on activities\n# 30% of total time spent is given by shows_time = 6 hours\ntotal_time_spent = shows_time / 0.3  # 6 hours is 30% of total time\n\n# Sightseeing time is 40% of total time spent\nsightseeing_time = 0.4 * total_time_spent\n\nsightseeing_time\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find out the time spent sightseeing.\n\nThe output will be calculated as follows:\n\n- From the calculation `total_time_spent = shows_time / 0.3`, we determine that the total time spent on activities is 20 hours.\n- Therefore, `sightseeing_time = 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours`.\n\nThis confirms the time John spent sightseeing is 8 hours."
