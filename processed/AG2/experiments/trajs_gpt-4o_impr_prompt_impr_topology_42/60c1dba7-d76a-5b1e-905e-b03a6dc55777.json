Let's define the variables:\n\n- Let \\( B \\) represent the number of cards Becca has.\n- Let \\( S \\) represent the number of cards Smendrick has.\n- Let \\( P \\) represent the number of cards PJ has.\n\nBased on the problem statement, we can derive the following equations:\n\n1. \\( B = S + 15 \\) (Becca has 15 more cards than Smendrick)\n2. \\( S = 4P \\) (Smendrick has 4 times the amount of cards that PJ has)\n3. \\( B + S + P = 447 \\) (The total number of cards is 447)\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for \\( B \\) and \\( S \\) from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3:\n\n\\[ (S + 15) + S + P = 447 \\]\n\nSince \\( S = 4P \\), substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[ (4P + 15) + 4P + P = 447 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 9P + 15 = 447 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ 9P = 447 - 15 \\]\n\\[ 9P = 432 \\]\n\\[ P = 48 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( P = 48 \\), we can find \\( S \\) using the equation \\( S = 4P \\):\n\n\\[ S = 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\]\n\nFinally, we can find \\( B \\) using the equation \\( B = S + 15 \\):\n\n\\[ B = 192 + 15 = 207 \\]\n\nTherefore, Becca has 207 cards. \n\nI will now discuss this solution with the other agents to consolidate our findings."
