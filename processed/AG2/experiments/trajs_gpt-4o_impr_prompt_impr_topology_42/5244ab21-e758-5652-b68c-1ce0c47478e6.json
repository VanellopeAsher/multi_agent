      "content": "Certainly, let's break down the problem to find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold:\n\n1. **Initial Purchase**: Mrs. Harrington purchased a dozen boxes of oranges. Since one dozen equals 12, she has 12 boxes. Given that each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially has is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\, \\text{boxes} \\times 20 \\, \\text{oranges per box} = 240 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Gifting Oranges**: Mrs. Harrington gave away 4 boxes in total (2 boxes to her mother and 2 to her sibling). Therefore, the number of oranges given away is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\, \\text{boxes} \\times 20 \\, \\text{oranges per box} = 80 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Oranges Remaining**: After gifting, the oranges remaining are:\n   \\[\n   240 \\, \\text{oranges} - 80 \\, \\text{oranges} = 160 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Retaining Oranges**: Mrs. Harrington retained a quarter of the remaining oranges. So, the number of oranges she kept is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 \\, \\text{oranges} = 40 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Oranges Sold**: The oranges sold are the remainder after retaining some for herself:\n   \\[\n   160 \\, \\text{oranges} - 40 \\, \\text{oranges} = 120 \\, \\text{oranges}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges. \n\nNow, let's discuss any thoughts or alternative approaches."
