In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To find out how much money Raymond has left, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: Raymond starts with $2100.\n\n2. **Allowance Saved**: Raymond saves $1100 from his allowance. So, we add this amount to his initial savings:\n   \\[\n   2100 + 1100 = 3200\n   \\]\n   This means Raymond now has $3200.\n\n3. **Spending on Comic Book**: Raymond spends $500 on a comic book. We deduct this from his total amount:\n   \\[\n   3200 - 500 = 2700\n   \\]\n\n4. **Spending on Puzzle**: Raymond also spends $1900 on a puzzle. We deduct this amount as well:\n   \\[\n   2700 - 1900 = 800\n   \\]\n\nSo, after all his savings and expenditures, Raymond is left with $800."
