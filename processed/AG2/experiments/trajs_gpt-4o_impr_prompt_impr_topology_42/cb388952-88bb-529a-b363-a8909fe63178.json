Let \\( S \\) represent the son's age.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n- Carver's age \\( C = 45 \\).\n- Carver's age is 15 years less than ten times the son's age.\n\nThis means the following equation can be formed:\n\n\\[ C = 10S - 15 \\]\n\nSince we already know Carver's age is 45, we can substitute \\( C \\) with 45:\n\n\\[ 45 = 10S - 15 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( S \\):\n\n1. Add 15 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( S \\) on one side:\n\n   \\[ 45 + 15 = 10S \\]\n\n   \\[ 60 = 10S \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 10 to solve for \\( S \\):\n\n   \\[ S = \\frac{60}{10} \\]\n\n   \\[ S = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the son's age is 6 years."
