      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for her streaming service over the entire year, considering the change in charges during the second half of the year. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the Monthly Charges for the First Half of the Year**:\n   - Aleena pays $200 per month for the first 6 months (January to June).\n   - Calculating the total for these 6 months:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 200 = 1200 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Monthly Charges for the Second Half of the Year**:\n   - The company charges 15% less for the last 6 months (July to December).\n   - A 15% reduction means Aleena pays 85% of the initial amount.\n   - New monthly charge:  \n     \\[\n     200 \\times 0.85 = 170 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total for the Second Half of the Year**:\n   - Calculating the total for the last 6 months:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\times 170 = 1020 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total for the Entire Year**:\n   - Add the totals from the first and second halves of the year together:  \n     \\[\n     1200 + 1020 = 2220 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\nThus, by the end of the year, Aleena would have paid a total of \\$\\(\\mathbf{2220}\\) for her streaming service subscription."

Aleena paid $200 per month for the first 6 months, totaling $1200.\n2. For the next 6 months, she paid 15% less, which was $170 per month, totaling $1020.\n3. Therefore, the total amount paid by Aleena for the streaming service over the entire year is $1200 + $1020 = $2220.\n\nThe calculations are consistent and correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2220}**"
