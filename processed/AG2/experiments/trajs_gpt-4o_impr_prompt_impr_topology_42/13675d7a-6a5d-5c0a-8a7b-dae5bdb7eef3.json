Calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wheels for cars} = \\text{Number of cars} \\times \\text{Wheels per car} = 57 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wheels for motorcycles} = \\text{Number of motorcycles} \\times \\text{Wheels per motorcycle} = 73 \\times 2\n   \\]\n\n3. Add these two results to find the total number of wheels used:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wheels used} = \\text{Wheels for cars} + \\text{Wheels for motorcycles}\n   \\]\n\n4. Given that there are 276 wheels left in the box, the initial number of wheels in the box was:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial wheels count} = \\text{Total wheels used} + \\text{Wheels remaining}\n   \\]\n\nI'll now code these calculations using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate wheels for cars\ncars = 57\nwheels_per_car = 4\nwheels_for_cars = cars * wheels_per_car\n\n# Calculate wheels for motorcycles\nmotorcycles = 73\nwheels_per_motorcycle = 2\nwheels_for_motorcycles = motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle\n\n# Calculate total wheels used\ntotal_wheels_used = wheels_for_cars + wheels_for_motorcycles\n\n# Remaining wheels in the box\nremaining_wheels = 276\n\n# Calculate initial number of wheels in the box\ninitial_wheels_count = total_wheels_used + remaining_wheels\n\nprint(initial_wheels_count)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Let's figure out how many wheels are used and relate this to the total number of wheels we have in the beginning, considering there are 276 remaining.\n\n1. **Wheels Required for Cars**:\n   - Each car requires 4 wheels.\n   - Total cars = 57\n   - Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels\n\n2. **Wheels Required for Motorcycles**:\n   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.\n   - Total motorcycles = 73\n   - Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels\n\n3. **Total Wheels Used for Assembly**:\n   - Combine the wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles.\n   - Total wheels used = 228 (cars) + 146 (motorcycles) = 374 wheels\n\n4. **Calculate Initial Total Wheels**:\n   - After assembling all toys, 276 wheels are left in the box.\n   - Thus, the initial number of wheels in the box is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Initial wheels} = \\text{Total wheels used} + \\text{Wheels remaining} = 374 + 276 = 650\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter calculating independently, we find that the total initial number of wheels in the box is indeed 650, which confirms the result from Agent Code Executor's calculations.\n\nOverall, it seems we have corroborated the solution, and we can confidently conclude that 650 wheels were initially in the box. Would anyone like to add anything or discuss further?"
