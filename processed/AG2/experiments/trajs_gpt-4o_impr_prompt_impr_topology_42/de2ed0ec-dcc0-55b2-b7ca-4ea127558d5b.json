The fourth child is given as 72 inches tall.\n2. The third child is 3 inches shorter than the fourth, so the third child is 72 - 3 = 69 inches.\n3. The second child is 5 inches taller than the third, so the second child is 69 + 5 = 74 inches.\n4. The first child is 2 inches shorter than the second, so the first child is 74 - 2 = 72 inches.\n\nFinally, I will convert 72 inches to feet using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of inches for the first child's height\nfirst_child_height_inches = 72\n\n# Convert inches to feet\nfirst_child_height_feet = first_child_height_inches / 12\n\n# Display the result\nprint(first_child_height_feet)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
