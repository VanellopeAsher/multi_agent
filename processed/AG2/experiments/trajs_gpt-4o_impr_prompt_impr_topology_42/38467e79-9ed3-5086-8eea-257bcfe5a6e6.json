The problem states that two-thirds of the students have desktop computers, and therefore one-third of the students do not have desktop computers.\n\nGiven that 30 students do not have desktop computers, this represents one-third of the total number of students. Let \\( x \\) represent the total number of students in the grade level.\n\nAccording to the given information, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times x = 30 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\n1. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[ x = 3 \\times 30 \\]\n\n   \\[ x = 90 \\]\n\nThe total number of students at that grade level is 90."
