Kelly claims that Courtney overstated the audience by 20%.\n\nWe can express the documented audience size by Courtney (\\(C\\)) in terms of the actual number of people present:\n\n\\[ C = \\text{actual audience size} + 20\\% \\text{ of actual audience size} \\]\n\nGiven that the actual audience size is 40, we can calculate 20% of these 40 people:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 40 = 8 \\]\n\nAdding this to the actual size will give us the size reported by Courtney:\n\n\\[ C = 40 + 8 = 48 \\]\n\nAccording to Courtney, the audience size was 48. The numbers align as long as we understand that Courtney overestimated. Therefore, both the calculations and the logic confirm that the audience size, as reported by Courtney, was indeed 48."
