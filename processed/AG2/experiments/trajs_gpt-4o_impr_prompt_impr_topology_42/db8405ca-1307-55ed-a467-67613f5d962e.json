      "content": "To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then combine them. Here's how we can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the wooden tables:**\n   - Number of tables = 40\n   - Cost per table = $200\n   - Total cost for tables = 40 tables * $200/table = $8,000\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the roof frames:**\n   - Number of roof frames = 20\n   - Cost per roof frame = $100\n   - Total cost for roof frames = 20 roof frames * $100/roof frame = $2,000\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount Ali has to pay:**\n   - Total cost for tables + Total cost for roof frames = $8,000 + $2,000 = $10,000\n\nTherefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $10,000.\n\nIf any agent wants to further verify this calculation, please feel free to discuss it."
