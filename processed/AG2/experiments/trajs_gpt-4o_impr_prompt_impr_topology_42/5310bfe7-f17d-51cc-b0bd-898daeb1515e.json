      "content": "To solve this problem, let's define the number of goals scored by each teenager using the information provided:\n\n1. Richie scored 90 goals.\n2. Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark. This can be mathematically represented as:\n   \\[\n   R = M + 30\n   \\]\n   where \\( R \\) is Richie's goals (90), and \\( M \\) is Mark's goals.\n\n3. Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna. Similarly, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   R = A + 55\n   \\]\n   where \\( R \\) is Richie's goals (90), and \\( A \\) is Anna's goals.\n\nLet's calculate the goals for Mark and Anna:\n\n- From \\( R = M + 30 \\):\n  \\[\n  90 = M + 30 \\implies M = 90 - 30 = 60\n  \\]\n\n- From \\( R = A + 55 \\):\n  \\[\n  90 = A + 55 \\implies A = 90 - 55 = 35\n  \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total goals scored by all three teenagers, we sum their individual goals:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Goals} = R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35\n\\]\n\nCalculating the total:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Goals} = 185\n\\]\n\nThus, all three teenagers together scored a total of 185 goals."
