In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

So at the end of the second week, it would be:\n     \\[\n     3 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 2 = 6 \\, \\text{inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Week 3**:\n   - After the third week, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.\n   - To find out how much it grew in the third week, subtract the height at the end of the second week from the final height after the third week:\n     \\[\n     10 \\, \\text{inches} - 6 \\, \\text{inches} = 4 \\, \\text{inches}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the beanstalk grew 4 inches in the third week. Now let's open up discussions for any other perspectives or confirmations."
