For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mechanic's earnings for Thursday and Friday and use the given information to find the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n\n1. **Calculate the Earnings for Thursday**:\n   - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires. Each truck tire is charged at $60.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from truck tires on Thursday} = 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ dollars} \n     \\]\n   - The mechanic repairs 4 car tires. Each car tire is charged at $40.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from car tires on Thursday} = 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Total earnings on Thursday:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total earnings on Thursday} = 360 + 160 = 520 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Earnings for Friday**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n   - Each car tire is charged at $40.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings on Friday} = 40 \\times x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Use the Given Information to Form an Equation**:\n   - We know the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n     \\[\n     520 = 40x + 40\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     520 - 40 = 40x \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     480 = 40x \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{480}{40}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 12\n     \\]\n\nThus, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or any further steps needed!"
