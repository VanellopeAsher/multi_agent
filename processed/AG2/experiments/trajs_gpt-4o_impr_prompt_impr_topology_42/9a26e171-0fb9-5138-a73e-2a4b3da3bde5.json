      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of students at the grade level.\n\n1. **Identify Non-Computer Owners**: We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this is one-third of those who do not have any type of computer (desktop or laptop). Therefore, the total number of students without any computers is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 3 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand Student Distribution**:\n   - Let \\( N \\) be the total number of students.\n   - Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop, it means one-fourth do not have a desktop. \n   - The one-fourth without desktops includes students who might have laptops. However, from this group, 60 students specifically do not have any computers.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Students**:\n   - Since 60 students do not have any computers and this group represents one-fourth of the students, we can express the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}N = 60\n   \\]\n   - Solving for \\( N \\):\n   \\[\n   N = 60 \\times 4 = 240\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\( 240 \\) students at that grade level. Let me know if further clarification or calculation is needed. Let's discuss this solution."
