  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we can follow these steps to break it down:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Weight of Each Type of Feed**:\n   - **Sugar Cubes**:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ boxes} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds/box} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Carrots**:\n     \\[\n     40 \\text{ bags} \\times 120 \\text{ pounds/bag} = 4800 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Hay**:\n     \\[\n     420 \\text{ bales} \\times 750 \\text{ pounds/bale} = 315000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - **Oats**:\n     \\[\n     200 \\text{ sacks} \\times 650 \\text{ pounds/sack} = 130000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Weight of All the Feed**:\n   - Sum up the weights of all types of feed:\n     \\[\n     200 \\text{ pounds (sugar cubes)} + 4800 \\text{ pounds (carrots)} + 315000 \\text{ pounds (hay)} + 130000 \\text{ pounds (oats)} = 450000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Trips the Farm Truck Needs**:\n   - The truck can carry 22500 pounds per trip.\n   - Divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity, rounding up to the next whole number since any remainder would require an additional trip:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of trips} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{450000}{22500} \\right\\rceil\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Compute the division:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{450000}{22500} = 20\n     \\]\n   - Since the result is a whole number, the farmer needs exactly 20 trips.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to make 20 trips with his farm truck to transport all the feed."
