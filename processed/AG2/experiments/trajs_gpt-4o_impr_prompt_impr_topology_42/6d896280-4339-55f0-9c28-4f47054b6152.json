      "content": "To determine how many chimichangas are made on Tuesday, we can break down the problem statement and solve it step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n   - Since the shop makes the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, they also make \\( x \\) chimichangas on Wednesday.\n   - On Friday, they make twice as much as they do on Tuesday, which means they produce \\( 2x \\) chimichangas.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - The total number of chimichangas across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is 500. Thus, the equation can be set up as:\n     \\[\n     x + x + 2x = 500\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\[\n     4x = 500\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.\n\nLet's discuss this solution to verify accuracy and clarity."

They have broken down the equation clearly and verified the result through both mathematical reasoning and code execution.\n\nTo recap the solution:\n- We let \\( x \\) represent the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\n- According to the logic provided:\n  - Tuesday and Wednesday: \\( x \\) each.\n  - Friday: \\( 2x \\).\n- Total production is given as 500, leading to the equation:\n  \\[\n  x + x + 2x = 500\n  \\]\n- Which simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  4x = 500\n  \\]\n- Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = 125 \\).\n\nThus, the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday is consistent across both approaches.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{125}**"
