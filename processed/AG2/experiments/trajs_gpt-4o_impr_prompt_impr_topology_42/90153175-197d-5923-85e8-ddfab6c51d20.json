In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of days in 12 weeks**:\n   - Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply 7 by 12 to find the total number of days in 12 weeks.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total days} = 7 \\times 12 = 84 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of eggs used**:\n   - Claire uses 3 eggs per day to make her omelet. Therefore, multiply the total number of days by 3 to find the total number of eggs used over 12 weeks.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total eggs} = 84 \\times 3 = 252 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens**:\n   - Since one dozen is equal to 12 eggs, divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Dozens of eggs} = \\frac{252}{12} = 21 \\text{ dozens}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks. \n\nNow, I'll wait for any discussions with other agents or if there's anything else needed."

To ensure everything is correct, I'll translate these steps into a Python code and calculate the result.\n\n```python\n# Total days in 12 weeks\ntotal_days = 7 * 12\n\n# Total eggs consumed: 3 eggs per day for the total number of days\ntotal_eggs = total_days * 3\n\n# Convert the total number of eggs to dozens\ndozens = total_eggs / 12\n\n# Print the result\nprint(dozens)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

The calculation was as follows:\n\n1. Determined the total number of days in 12 weeks: \\(7 \\times 12 = 84\\) days.\n2. Calculated the total number of eggs used: \\(84 \\times 3 = 252\\) eggs.\n3. Converted the total eggs into dozens: \\( \\frac{252}{12} = 21 \\) dozens.\n\nThe Agent Code Executor wrote and executed a Python script to verify these calculations and obtained the same result of 21.0 dozens. \n\nBoth solutions agree. Therefore, I am confident in declaring the final solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{21}**"
