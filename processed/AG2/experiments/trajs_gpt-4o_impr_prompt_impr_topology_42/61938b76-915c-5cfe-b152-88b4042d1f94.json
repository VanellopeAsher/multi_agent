Carl buys 10 packages, each containing 6 biscuits, resulting in a total of 60 biscuits.\n2. Each biscuit costs $0.10, so the total cost for the biscuits is $6.00.\n3. Carl pays with a $10 note, which means the change he should receive back is $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the final amount of change Carl will receive is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{4.0}**"
