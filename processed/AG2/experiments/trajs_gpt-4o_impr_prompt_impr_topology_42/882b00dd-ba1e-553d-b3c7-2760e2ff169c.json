On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour than brfore. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?",

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's take it step by step and calculate both Billy's and Sally's earnings, then determine the difference between them.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Billy's Salary after 1 year:**\n\n   - **Starting Salary**: $10 per hour.\n   - **First Raise (after 2 months)**: Additional $0.50 per hour.\n   - **Salary after 2 months**: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n   - **Second Raise (on 1st anniversary)**: Additional $1.00 per hour.\n   - **Salary after 1 year**: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate Sally's Salary after 2 months:**\n\n   - **Starting Salary**: Billy's starting salary + $0.50 = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n   - **Raise after 2 months**: Additional $0.50 per hour.\n   - **Salary after 2 months**: $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate Earnings for 20 hours:**\n\n   - **Billy's Earnings**: $11.50 per hour × 20 hours = $230.\n   - **Sally's Earnings**: $11.00 per hour × 20 hours = $220.\n\n4. **Determine the Difference**:\n\n   - Difference in earnings: $230 - $220 = $10.\n\nSo, Billy will earn $10 more than Sally for the 20 hours of work. Let's discuss this solution with the team."
