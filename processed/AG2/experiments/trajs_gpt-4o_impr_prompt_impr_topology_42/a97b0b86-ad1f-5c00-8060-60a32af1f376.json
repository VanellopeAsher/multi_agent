      "content": "To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we can break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken meal**: \n   - The meal costs $12.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the milk packs**: \n   - Each milk pack costs $3.5. For 5 packs, the total cost is \\(5 \\times 3.5 = 17.5\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the apples**: \n   - Each apple costs $1.50. For 4 apples, the total cost is \\(4 \\times 1.5 = 6\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of chicken, milk, and apples**:\n   - Add these amounts: \\(12 + 17.5 + 6 = 35.5\\).\n\n5. **Determine the cost of the pizza boxes**:\n   - Marie paid a total of $52.5. Subtract the cost of chicken, milk, and apples from this total to determine how much was spent on pizzas: \n   \\[ 52.5 - 35.5 = 17 \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of pizza boxes**:\n   - Each pizza box costs $8.50. Thus, the number of pizza boxes is:\n   \\[ \\frac{17}{8.5} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
