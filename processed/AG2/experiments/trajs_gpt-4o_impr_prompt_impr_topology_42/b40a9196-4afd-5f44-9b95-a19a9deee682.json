Based on the details:\n   - Food items: Milk ($2), Eggs ($3)\n   - Non-food items: Light bulbs ($3), Cups ($3), Roach traps ($4)\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost for Food Items**: \n   - Total cost of milk and eggs: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Cost for Non-food Items**: \n   - Without tax, the cost is: \\(3 + 3 + 4 = 10\\) dollars.\n   - Applying the 10% tax to these items: \\(10 \\times 0.10 = 1\\) dollars (tax amount).\n   - So, the total cost including tax is: \\(10 + 1 = 11\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Total Cost**:\n   - Add the cost of food items and the taxed cost of the non-food items: \\(5 + 11 = 16\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total cost of the items considering the tax on non-food items is 16 dollars.
