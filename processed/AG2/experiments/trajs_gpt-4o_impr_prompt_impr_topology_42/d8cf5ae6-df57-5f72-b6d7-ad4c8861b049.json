  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total weight of all the feed the farmer purchases and then determine how many pounds his farm truck can carry in each trip if he needs to make 2 trips.\n\nLet's calculate the total weight:\n\n1. **Sugar Cubes**:  \n   The farmer buys two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes.  \n   Total weight of sugar cubes = \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) pounds.\n\n2. **Carrots**:  \n   The farmer buys four 12-pound bags of carrots.  \n   Total weight of carrots = \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) pounds.\n\n3. **Hay**:  \n   The farmer buys forty-two 75-pound bales of hay.  \n   Total weight of hay = \\(42 \\times 75 = 3150\\) pounds.\n\n4. **Oats**:  \n   The farmer buys twenty 65-pound sacks of oats.  \n   Total weight of oats = \\(20 \\times 65 = 1300\\) pounds.\n\nNow, add up all the weight to find the total weight of all the feed:\n\n- Total weight = \\(2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500\\) pounds.\n\nSince the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed, we divide the total weight equally between the two trips:\n\n- Weight per trip = \\(4500 \\div 2 = 2250\\) pounds.\n\nTherefore, the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. \n\nNow, let's discuss this solution and see if anyone has different insights."
