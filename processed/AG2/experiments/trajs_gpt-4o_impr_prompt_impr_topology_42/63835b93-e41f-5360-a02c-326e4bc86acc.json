In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Here is the breakdown:\n\n1. **Neutering Cost**:  \n   - The cost for neutering the kitten is $150.\n\n2. **Vaccine Costs**:  \n   - The kitten received 2 vaccines at $30 each.  \n   - So, the total cost for the vaccines is \\(2 \\times 30 = $60\\).\n\n3. **Broken Vases Costs**:  \n   - The kitten broke 3 vases, each costing $15.  \n   - So, the total cost for the broken vases is \\(3 \\times 15 = $45\\).\n\nNow, we add up all these expenses to find the total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Neutering Cost} + \\text{Total Vaccine Costs} + \\text{Total Broken Vases Cost}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 150 + 60 + 45 = 255\n\\]\n\nSo, Leah's kitten has cost her $255 so far."
