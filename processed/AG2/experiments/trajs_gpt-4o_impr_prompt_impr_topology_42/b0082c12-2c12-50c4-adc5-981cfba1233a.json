Hereâ€™s how we can calculate it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Spaying Cost**: \n   - Leah paid $200 for spaying her kitten.\n\n2. **Vaccine Cost**:\n   - Each vaccine costs $20 and Leah got 3 vaccines. \n   - Total cost for vaccines without discount = \\( 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\).\n   - Leah received a 10% discount on the total vaccine cost.\n   - Amount of discount = \\( 10\\% \\) of $60 = \\( \\frac{10}{100} \\times 60 = 6 \\).\n   - Total vaccine cost after discount = \\( 60 - 6 = 54 \\).\n\n3. **Cost of Broken Vases**:\n   - Each vase costs $12 and the kitten broke 4 vases.\n   - Total cost for the broken vases = \\( 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\).\n\n4. **Total Cost Calculation**:\n   - The total cost Leah has incurred = Spaying cost + Vaccine cost after discount + Cost of broken vases.\n   - Total cost \\( = 200 + 54 + 48 = 302 \\).\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\nLeah's kitten has cost her \\( \\boxed{302} \\) dollars so far."
