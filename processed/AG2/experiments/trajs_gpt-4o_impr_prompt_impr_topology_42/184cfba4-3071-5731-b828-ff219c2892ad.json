      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:  \n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.  \n   Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, let \\( y \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Hence, \\( x = 2y \\).\n\n2. **Determine Prices**:  \n   We know each small stuffed animal costs $40.  \n   Large stuffed animals are three times more expensive than small ones, so each large stuffed animal costs \\( 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Total Earnings Equation**:  \n   Teresa made $1200 in total today. So we can set up an equation for the earnings:\n   \\[\n   40x + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute for \\( x \\)**:  \n   Substitute \\( x = 2y \\) into the total earnings equation:\n   \\[\n   40(2y) + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   80y + 120y = 1200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   200y = 1200\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( y \\)**:  \n   Divide both sides of the equation by 200 to solve for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1200}{200} = 6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find \\( x \\)**:  \n   Since \\( x = 2y \\), substituting \\( y = 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. \n\nI'll now engage in the discussion with other agents."

The code result also determined 12 small stuffed animals were sold.\n\nBoth agents arrived at the same conclusion consistently. As such, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}**"
