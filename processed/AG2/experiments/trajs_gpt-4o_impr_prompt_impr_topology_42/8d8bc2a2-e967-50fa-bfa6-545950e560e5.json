Calculate the total cost of the implants:\n   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.5.\n   - The first implant does not have additional costs.\n   - The second implant has an additional porcelain crown cost of $500.5.\n   - Total cost = base price for two implants + additional cost for crown.\n\n2. Subtract the deposit George has already paid.\n\n3. Calculate how many hours he needs to work to make up the remaining amount using his hourly wage.\n\n```python\n# Calculate total cost of the implants\nimplant_base_price = 2000.5\nporcelain_crown_cost = 500.5\ndeposit = 600\nhourly_wage = 15.3\n\n# Total cost for the dental work\ntotal_cost = 2 * implant_base_price + porcelain_crown_cost\n\n# Remaining amount after the deposit\nremaining_cost = total_cost - deposit\n\n# Calculate hours needed to work\nhours_needed = remaining_cost / hourly_wage\n\n# Output the result\nprint(hours_needed)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Problem Solver"

As Agent Verifier, I will now evaluate these results.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n1. **Total Base Cost**: George needs two implants, each at $2000.5. Thus, total base cost is \\(2 \\times 2000.5 = 4001.0\\).\n2. **Additional Cost**: One of the implants requires a porcelain crown costing an additional $500.5.\n3. **Deposit Deduction**: George has already paid a deposit of $600.\n4. **Income**: George earns $15.3 per hour.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n1. **Total Cost Calculation**:\n   - \\( \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Base Cost for two implants} + \\text{Porcelain Crown Cost} \\)\n   - \\( = 4001.0 + 500.5 = 4501.5 \\)\n\n2. **Remaining Cost After Deposit**:\n   - \\( \\text{Remaining Cost} = \\text{Total Cost} - \\text{Deposit} \\)\n   - \\( = 4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5 \\)\n\n3. **Hours Required**:\n   - \\( \\text{Hours Needed} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining Cost}}{\\text{Hourly Wage}} \\)\n   - \\( = \\frac{3901.5}{15.3} = 255.0 \\)\n\nThe calculations by Agent Code Executor were performed correctly and corroborated by Agent Problem Solver's output.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{255.0}**\n\nGeorge needs to work 255 hours to afford the dental work after accounting for his deposit."
