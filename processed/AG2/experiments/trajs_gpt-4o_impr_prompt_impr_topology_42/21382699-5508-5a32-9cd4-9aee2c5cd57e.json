      "content": "To solve for Allen's age 10 years from now, let's first determine Darrell and Allen's current ages given that their age ratio is 7:11 and their combined age is 162.\n\n1. **Set up variables for their ages**:  \n   - Let \\( D \\) be Darrell's age.\n   - Let \\( A \\) be Allen's age.\n\n2. **Use the given age ratio**:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{D}{A} = \\frac{7}{11}\n   \\]\n   This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   11D = 7A \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the total age given**:  \n   \\[\n   D + A = 162 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the system of equations**:  \n   We can substitute \\( D \\) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:\n   \\[\n   D = 162 - A\n   \\]\n   Substitute into Equation 1:\n   \\[\n   11(162 - A) = 7A\n   \\]\n   Simplify and solve for \\( A \\):\n   \\[\n   1782 - 11A = 7A\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1782 = 18A\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1782}{18} = 99\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now**:  \n   Allenâ€™s current age is 99. Thus, 10 years from now, Allen's age would be:\n   \\[\n   99 + 10 = 109\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109 years. Let's discuss and verify this solution with other agents."
