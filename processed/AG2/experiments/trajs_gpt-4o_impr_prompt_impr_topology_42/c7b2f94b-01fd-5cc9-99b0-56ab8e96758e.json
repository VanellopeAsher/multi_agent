Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

      "content": "To solve the problem, let's break it down into smaller, manageable steps:\n\n1. **Identify the apples gathered by Joanne:**\n   - Tallest trees: Joanne gathers 30 apples.\n   - Shortest trees: Joanne gathers half of what she gathered from the tallest trees, so she gathers \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\) apples.\n   - Average trees: Joanne gathers 350 apples.\n\n   So total apples gathered by Joanne = 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + 350 (average) = 395 apples.\n\n2. **Identify how many apples Joanne's sister gathers:**\n   - Tallest trees: Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples as Joanne did, so she gathers \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\) apples.\n   - Shortest trees: Let's denote the number of apples her sister gathers from the shortest trees as \\( x \\).\n   - Average trees: She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.\n\n3. **Total apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister:**\n   According to the problem, both sisters together gather 500 apples.\n\n4. **Formulate the equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Apples gathered by Joanne} + \\text{Apples gathered by her sister} = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   395 + (60 + x) = 500\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Simplifying the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   395 + 60 + x = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   455 + x = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 500 - 455 = 45\n   \\]\n\n   So Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n\n6. **Determine how many times Joanne's sister gathers compared to Joanne from the shortest trees:**\n   Since Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees, the ratio of apples gathered by her sister to Joanne from the shortest trees is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{45}{15} = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees."
