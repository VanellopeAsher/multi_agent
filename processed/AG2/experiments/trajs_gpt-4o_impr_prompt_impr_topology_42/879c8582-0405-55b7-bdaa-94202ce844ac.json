      "content": "To find out how many students Miss Maria can give the remaining sports cards to, let's start by calculating the total number of cards she has and the number of cards she gives away.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of basketball cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, with 25 cards per deck.\n   - Total basketball cards = \\( 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of baseball cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has 5 boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards per box.\n   - Total baseball cards = \\( 5 \\times 40 = 200 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of soccer cards:**\n   - Miss Maria has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards.\n   - Total soccer cards = 30.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of all sports cards:**\n   - Total cards = Total basketball cards + Total baseball cards + Total soccer cards.\n   - Total cards = \\( 150 + 200 + 30 = 380 \\).\n\n5. **Determine the number of cards Miss Maria keeps:**\n   - Miss Maria keeps 50 cards.\n\n6. **Calculate the number of cards to be given to students:**\n   - Cards given to students = Total cards - Cards kept by Miss Maria.\n   - Cards given to students = \\( 380 - 50 = 330 \\).\n\n7. **Calculate the number of students who receive cards:**\n   - Each student receives 10 cards.\n   - Number of students = Cards given to students / Cards per student.\n   - Number of students = \\( 330 / 10 = 33 \\).\n\nTherefore, Miss Maria has **33 students** who each receive 10 cards. \n\nWould you like to discuss this solution or if there's anything else you'd like to add or question, let's engage in that now!"
