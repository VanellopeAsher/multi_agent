In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 600 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the number of boys and girls in each group:**\n   - Since there are 200 kids in total and they are divided equally into girls and boys, there are \\(\\frac{200}{2} = 100\\) boys and \\(\\frac{200}{2} = 100\\) girls.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected by the boys:**\n   - Each boy collected 600 seashells.\n   - Therefore, the total number of seashells collected by all boys is \\(100 \\times 600 = 60,000\\) seashells.\n\n3. **Express the number of seashells collected by the girls:**\n   - The problem states that the girls collected an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\n   - Thus, the total number of seashells collected by the girls can be written as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Seashells by girls} = 60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate how many seashells were brought by each girl:**\n   - If there are 100 girls and together they collected 300,000 seashells, then each girl collected:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{300,000}{100} = 3,000 \\text{ seashells}\n     \\]\n\nSo, each girl brought back 3,000 seashells."
