Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

For 2 pairs, it’s $200.\n   - Total amount needed = $120 + $200 = $320.\n\n2. **Current Savings and Earnings**:\n   - Initially saved $100.\n   - Babysitting 10 times at $5 each earns $50.\n   - Total at hand = $100 + $50 = $150.\n\n3. **Shortfall**:\n   - Amount needed = $320 - $150 = $170.\n\n4. **Earnings from Lawn Mowing**:\n   - Each mowing session earns $10.\n   - Mowing needed = $170 / $10 = 17 times.\n\nThe number 17 tells us the precise number of times she must mow the lawn to make exactly $170, filling the monetary gap.\n\nAgent Code Executor, could you code this solution so we can confirm our calculations match the expected results?
