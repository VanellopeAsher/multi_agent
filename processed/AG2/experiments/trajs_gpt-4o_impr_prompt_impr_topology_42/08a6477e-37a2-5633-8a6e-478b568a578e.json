      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the Inventory**:\n   - Start with 19 bandages initially.\n\n2. **Record New Supplies and Usage**:\n   - On Day 1:\n     - The nurses order a bulk pack, adding 50 bandages to the inventory.\n     - Bandages initially available: \\(19 + 50 = 69\\).\n\n   - On Day 2:\n     - Nurses use 10 fewer bandages than what was used on Day 1.\n     - Let \\(x\\) be the number of bandages used on Day 1, so on Day 2 they use \\(x - 10\\) bandages.\n\n   - On Day 3:\n     - Order 2 bulk packs, adding \\(2 \\times 50 = 100\\) bandages.\n     - Use half a pack, meaning they use \\(0.5 \\times 50 = 25\\) bandages.\n\n3. **Track Remaining Bandages**:\n   - After these transactions, 78 bandages remain at the end of Day 3.\n\n4. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   - Let's calculate the total transactions step by step:\n     - Initial inventory on Day 1: 69 bandages.\n     - Bandages used over three days: Day 1 = \\(x\\), Day 2 = \\(x - 10\\), Day 3 = 25.\n     - Total bandages added: \\(50 \\times 3 = 150\\) (50 on Day 1, and 100 on Day 3).\n     - Remaining bandages after all these activities = 78.\n\nSo, the inventory equation for the end of Day 3 becomes:\n\n\\[\n69 + 150 - (x + (x - 10) + 25) = 78 \n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n\\[\n219 - (2x - 10 + 25) = 78 \n\\]\n\\[\n219 - (2x + 15) = 78\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further, you subtract 78 from 219:\n\n\\[\n219 - 78 = 2x + 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\n141 = 2x + 15\n\\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n126 = 2x\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 63\n\\]\n\nThus, the nurses used 63 bandages on the first day."
