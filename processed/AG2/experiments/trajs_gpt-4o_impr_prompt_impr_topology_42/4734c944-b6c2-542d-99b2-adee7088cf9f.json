In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine Daily Spending**: Peter has $70 to spend equally over 7 days in a week. Therefore, his daily budget is $70/7 = $10 per day.\n\n2. **Days and Costs**:\n   - From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures costing $5 each.\n   - From Thursday through Saturday, Peter purchases plastic action figures costing $2.5 each.\n\n3. **Calculate Action Figures for Each Day Type**:\n   - **Sunday through Wednesday (4 days)**:\n     - Daily budget on action figures: $10.\n     - Number of wooden action figures per day: $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures.\n     - Total wooden action figures for 4 days: 2 action figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures.\n\n   - **Thursday through Saturday (3 days)**:\n     - Daily budget on action figures: $10.\n     - Number of plastic action figures per day: $10 / $2.5 = 4 plastic action figures.\n     - Total plastic action figures for 3 days: 4 action figures/day * 3 days = 12 plastic action figures.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Action Figures**:\n   - Total action figures = Total wooden action figures + Total plastic action figures.\n   - Total action figures = 8 wooden action figures + 12 plastic action figures = 20 action figures.\n\nTherefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 20 action figures.\n\nLet's discuss and confirm the calculations with the team."
