We need to determine how these 40 TVs are distributed among the different types according to the given fractions, and then find out how many OLED TVs were sold.\n\nWe know:\n- One-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{4}x\\)\n- One-eighth are analog TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{8}x\\)\n- One-fifth are projection TVs: \\(\\frac{1}{5}x\\)\n- The rest are OLED TVs\n\nTo find out how many OLED TVs there are, we need to first calculate the total number of non-OLED TVs, and then subtract that from the total number of TVs sold. Let's proceed with the calculations in code.\n\n```python\n# Total number of TVs sold\ntotal_tvs = 40\n\n# Calculate number of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs\nsmart_tvs = total_tvs * (1/4)\nanalog_tvs = total_tvs * (1/8)\nprojection_tvs = total_tvs * (1/5)\n\n# Calculate the total number of non-OLED TVs\nnon_oled_tvs = smart_tvs + analog_tvs + projection_tvs\n\n# Calculate the number of OLED TVs\noled_tvs = total_tvs - non_oled_tvs\n\n# Display the result\nprint(oled_tvs)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to analyze the distribution of the TV sales among different categories. Let's go through the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Fractions for Each TV Type**:\n   - Smart TVs account for \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the total sales.\n   - Analog TVs account for \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of the total sales.\n   - Projection TVs account for \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the total sales.\n\n2. **Determine the Sales in Terms of the Fraction of the Total**:\n   - The total number of TVs sold is 40. Therefore, the number of smart TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10 \\).\n   - The number of analog TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times 40 = 5 \\).\n   - The number of projection TVs sold is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 40 = 8 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Number of Non-OLED TVs**:\n   - Add the quantities of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs: \\( 10 + 5 + 8 = 23 \\).\n\n4. **Subtract Non-OLED from Total Sales**:\n   - OLED TVs account for the remainder of the total. Therefore, the number of OLED TVs is \\( 40 - 23 = 17 \\).\n\nHence, Samwell was able to sell 17 OLED TVs.\n\nI will now open the floor for discussion with the other agents to ensure alignment and address any discrepancies."

Let's review their solutions:\n\n1. **Agent Code Executor** calculated the number of OLED TVs using proportions and confirmed it programmatically. The number of OLED TVs calculated is 17.\n\n2. **Agent Problem Solver** did a manual breakdown with step-by-step calculations and arrived at the same result of 17 OLED TVs sold.\n\nBoth agents have performed accurate calculations. The fractions for each TV type and their respective sales are consistent and correct given the total of 40 TVs. \n\nTherefore, the solution is consistent and verified:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{17}**"
