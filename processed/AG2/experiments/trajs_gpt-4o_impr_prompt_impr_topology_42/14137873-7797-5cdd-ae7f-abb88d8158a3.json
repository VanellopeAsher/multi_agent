  "problem": "Dave purchased a big packet of french fries and consumed fourteen before a ravenous seagull snatched the packet from his grasp. Upon landing, the seagull devoured half the quantity of french fries that Dave had consumed. Subsequently, three pigeons chased him away from the meal, and each pigeon consumed three fries. Later, a raccoon pilfered two thirds of the remaining fries. A single french fry was then carried away by ants, leaving only five behind. What was the initial quantity of french fries in the packet that Dave purchased?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to carefully trace each step of the consumption of the french fries to find the initial quantity.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Let's denote the initial number of french fries as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Fries After Dave's Consumption**:\n   - Dave consumed 14 french fries.\n   - Fries left after Dave: \\( x - 14 \\)\n\n3. **Seagull's Consumption**:\n   - The seagull consumed half of what Dave consumed. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull consumed \\( \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\) fries.\n   - Fries left after the seagull: \\( (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21 \\)\n\n4. **Pigeons' Consumption**:\n   - Three pigeons came and each consumed 3 fries, totaling \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) fries.\n   - Fries left after the pigeons: \\( (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30 \\)\n\n5. **Raccoon's Consumption**:\n   - The raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries.\n   - Fries left after the raccoon: \\( (1 - \\frac{2}{3})(x - 30) = \\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \\)\n\n6. **Ants and Remaining Fries**:\n   - The ants took 1 fry.\n   - Fries left after the ants: \\( \\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \\)\n\n7. **Equation Setup and Solve**:\n   - We set up the equation based on the remaining fries:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6\n     \\]\n   - Multiply both sides by 3:\n     \\[\n     x - 30 = 18\n     \\]\n   - Add 30 to both sides:\n     \\[\n     x = 48\n     \\]\n\nThus, the initial quantity of french fries that Dave purchased was 48."
