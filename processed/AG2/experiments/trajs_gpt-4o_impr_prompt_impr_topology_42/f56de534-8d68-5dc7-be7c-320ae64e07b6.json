Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Lego Set**:  \n   The first set has 500 pieces.  \n\n2. **Second Lego Set**:  \n   The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first one.  \n   So, \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\) pieces.  \n\n3. **Third Lego Set**:  \n   The third set has \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the pieces of the first set.  \n   So, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 500 = 125\\) pieces.  \n\n4. **Fourth Lego Set**:  \n   The fourth set has 125 more pieces than the first set.  \n   So, \\(500 + 125 = 625\\) pieces.  \n\n5. **Calculating Total Number of Pieces**:  \n   Add up the pieces from all the sets:  \n   \\(500 + 1500 + 125 + 625 = 2750\\)\n\nTherefore, Johnny picks up a total of 2750 Lego pieces."
