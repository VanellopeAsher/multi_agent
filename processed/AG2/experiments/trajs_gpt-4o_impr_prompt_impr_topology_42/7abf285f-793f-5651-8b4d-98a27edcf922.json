Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays for her debts each month when she pays 50% more than the minimum required payments. Finally, we'll compute the total annual payment based on her monthly expenses. Here's how to solve it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Minimum Monthly Payments**:\n   - Student Loans: $300/month\n   - Credit Card: $200/month\n   - Mortgage: $500/month\n\n2. **Calculate 50% More than Each Minimum**:\n   - For Student Loans: \\( 300 + (300 \\times 0.5) = 300 + 150 = 450 \\)\n   - For Credit Card: \\( 200 + (200 \\times 0.5) = 200 + 100 = 300 \\)\n   - For the Mortgage: \\( 500 + (500 \\times 0.5) = 500 + 250 = 750 \\)\n\n3. **Total Increase Monthly Payments**:\n   - \\( 450 (Student Loans) + 300 (Credit Card) + 750 (Mortgage) = 1500 \\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Annual Debt Payments**:\n   - Each month Jessica pays \\(1500\\) for her debts.\n   - Over 12 months: \\(1500 \\times 12 = 18000\\)\n\nThus, Jessica will pay a total of $18,000 for her debts in a year, considering she pays 50% more than the minimum on each debt. The payments for subscriptions like Netflix do not affect this debt payment calculation, as the coupon offsets the cost completely."
