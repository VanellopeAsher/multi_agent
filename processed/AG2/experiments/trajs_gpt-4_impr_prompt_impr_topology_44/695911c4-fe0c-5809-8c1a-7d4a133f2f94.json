As she visited the museum three times a year and each visit cost $10, the cost for a year was 3 * $10 = $30. Therefore, for 10 years she spent 10 * $30 = $300.\n\nIn the next 3 years, every visit cost was increased by 150%, which means each ticket cost now $10 + $10 * 150/100 = $25. Therefore, the cost for a year increased to 3 * $25 = $75. So, for 3 years she spent 3 * $75 = $225.\n\nSumming up the costs for all the years, Pauline spent on all visits to the museum $300 + $225 = $525."

As she visited the museum three times a year and 1 visit costed $10, the cost for a year was 3 * 10 (visits per year * ticket price). Therefore, for 10 years she spent 10 * 3 * 10 (years * visits per year * ticket price).\n   \n2. In the next 3 years, every visit cost was increased by 150%, which means each ticket cost now 10 (original price) + 10 * 150/100 (increased by 150%). Therefore, the cost for a year increased to 3 * (10 + 10 * 150/100) (visits per year * increased ticket price). So, for 3 years she spent 3 * 3 * (10 + 10 * 150/100) (years * visits per year * increased ticket price).\n   \n3. To get the total amount spent, add the amounts spent during the first ten years and the next three years after the ticket price increase.\n\nLet's write this to the code:"
