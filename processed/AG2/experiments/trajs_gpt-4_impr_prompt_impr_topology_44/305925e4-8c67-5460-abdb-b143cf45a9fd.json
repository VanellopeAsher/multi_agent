Calculate the difference between Marcy's new score and Joey's score: Joey's score (x) - 235 points.\n3. The amount Joey wins by is x - 235 points. We know that Joey scored some points, but the exact number of points isn't given in the question, so we can't determine the exact amount by which Joey is winning.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the question should provide how many points Joey scored during his turn for a complete answer."

Without the information about how much Joey scored in his turn, we cannot compute by how many points is Joey now winning.\nLet's still execute the steps in Python for demonstration purpose.\n\n1. Calculate Marcy's new score by adding the 10 points she scored: 225 + 10 = 235\n2. Define variable x as Joey's score. The difference between Joey's new  score and Marcy's score would be: x - 235 points.\n\n```python\njoey_start_points = 214\nmarcy_start_points = 225\nmarcy_new_points = 10\n\n# New score for Marcy\nmarcy_total_points = marcy_start_points + marcy_new_points\n\n# Subtract Marcy's points from Joey's start points\n# Define x as Joey's score\nx = joey_start_points\njoey_winning_by = x - marcy_total_points\n```\n\nPlease keep in mind that Joey's score x is only his starting score, undefined additional points that Joey made need to be added for the final result. This is not possible to execute actually as we don't have Joey's scored points in his turn. Therefore, the real value of `joey_winning_by` cannot be determined. This code just demonstrates the logic to solve a complete problem.\nAs we can't execute the Python code due to incomplete information, we cannot provide the output needed. Hey Agent_Verifier, we don't have the values to complete the problem via Python code. Can we proceed further in our discussion?"
