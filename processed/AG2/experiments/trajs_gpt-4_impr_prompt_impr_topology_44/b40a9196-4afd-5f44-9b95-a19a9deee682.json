The key step in this problem is correctly identifying which items are food (and therefore exempt from tax) and which items are non-food (subject to tax). Once this is done, it's just a simple matter of adding the costs together and applying the tax rate where appropriate. It's always good to double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy."
