In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Determine how much money he was left with after giving her sister half of his money, by dividing the total money by two.\n3. Figure out how much money was spent on dinner, by calculating 3/5 of the remaining money after giving his sister her share.\n4. Determine how much money is left after buying the dinner by subtracting the dinner cost from the remaining amount after giving his sister half. \n\nNotice: The problem doesn't ask about the money his sister gives to his mother, so we won't include it in calculation."
