Compute the total amount of time John spent watching shows by multiplying the number of shows by the length of each show.\n3. Determine the total amount of time John spent by dividing the total time watching shows by the percentage this activity made up of his total time.\n4. Finally, calculate the amount of time John spent sightseeing by multiplying the total time he spent on vacation by the percentage of time he spent sightseeing.\n5. Provide the answer.\n\nLet's start by performing these calculations."

They also both computed the time John spent sightseeing to be 40% of the total vacation time. The executed code returned 800 hours, which supports the problem-solving approach.\n\nSo, the solution is: John spent 800 hours sightseeing. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{800}."
