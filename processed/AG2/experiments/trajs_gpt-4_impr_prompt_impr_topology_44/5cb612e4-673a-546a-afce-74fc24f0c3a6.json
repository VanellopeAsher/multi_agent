In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "I suggest we use algebra to solve this problem. Here's my proposed solution. \n\nLet's denote the number of bags the trader sold as X.\n\n- The cost of each bag was $20, so the total cost was $20*X\n- The cost of transportation for each bag was $2, so the total cost of transportation was $2*X\n- The selling price for each bag was $30, so the total income from selling the bags was $30*X\n- The profit is the total income minus the total expenses. In other words, $30*X - $20*X - $2*X = $400\n\nBy solving this equation, we will get the value of X, which represents the number of bags sold."
