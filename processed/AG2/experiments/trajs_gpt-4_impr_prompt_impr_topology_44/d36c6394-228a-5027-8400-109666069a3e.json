So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus, taking the total to 40(old passengers) + 40(new passengers) = 80 passengers.\n- But, before the bus departs, 2 of the new passengers get off. So, we now have 80 - 2 = 78 passengers on the bus.\n- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 78 - 21 = 57 passengers on the bus.\n- Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus as compared to the number who got off. So, 21/3 = 7 passengers get on the bus.\n- Therefore, the total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 57(old passengers) + 7(new passengers) = 64 passengers."
