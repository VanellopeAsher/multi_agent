So, multiply 2 (the number of remoras) by 6 (the length of each remora).\n\n2. The combined length of the remoras represents 10% of the shark's body length. Therefore, the shark's length is the total length of the remoras divided by 10%.\n\nLet's put these steps in mathematical format:\n\n1. total_length_of_remoras = 2 * 6\n2. length_of_shark = total_length_of_remoras / 0.1\n\nOnce we have these calculations, we can get the shark's length."

Both agents correctly derived that the total length of the remoras is 12 inches (6 inches each). Since this total length is said to be equal to 10% of the shark's length, they correctly calculated the shark's length to be 120 inches by dividing the total remoras' length by 0.1 (equivalent to 10%). Therefore, based on the evidence provided, I declare that the shark's length is 120 inches. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{120} inches."
