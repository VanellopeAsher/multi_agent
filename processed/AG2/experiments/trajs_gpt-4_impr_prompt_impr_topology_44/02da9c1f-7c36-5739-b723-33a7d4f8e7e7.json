She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 for her friends and 2 for her teachers. So we add these numbers together to find the total number of gifts.\n2. Then, we divide the total amount of ribbon that Monica has by the total number of gifts to find out how much ribbon she can use for each gift bow.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation:"
