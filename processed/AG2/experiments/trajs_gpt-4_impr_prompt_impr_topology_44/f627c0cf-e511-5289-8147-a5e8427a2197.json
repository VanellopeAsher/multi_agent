Mark lost 10 pounds per month.\n\nHowever, the information about the duration for which Mark was unwell and therefore losing weight is missing. This duration is necessary to find out his initial weight.\n\nWe can represent the problem mathematically as follows:\n\n(FinalWeight) = (InitialWeight) - (WeightLostPerMonth * DurationInMonths)\n\nWe need the DurationInMonths to find the InitialWeight.\n\nSo, in order to answer the question, the following equation would apply:\n\n(InitialWeight) = (FinalWeight) + (WeightLostPerMonth * DurationInMonths)\n\nUntil we know the value of DurationInMonths, we cannot solve this equation. The problem statement needs to provide this information."

The equation to calculate the initial weight from the final weight and the weight loss rate requires the duration as an input.\n\nTherefore, we may conclude that it is impossible to find Mark's initial weight without this critical piece of information. The calculation would be straightforward if we had the duration: we would simply add the amount of weight lost (which is the product of the rate of weight loss and the duration) to the final weight. But without it, we can't proceed.\n\nAll agents' solutions align with this conclusion."
