  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",

      "content": "Here are the steps for calculating the number of truck trips needed to transport all the feed:\n\n1. Determine the total weight of each type of feed. For sugar cubes, multiply twenty 10-pound boxes by 10 pounds each. For carrots, multiply forty 120-pound bags by 120 pounds each. For hay, multiply four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales by 750 pounds each. For oats, multiply two hundred 650-pound sacks by 650 pounds each.\n\n2. Sum up the total weights of all types of feed to get the overall weight of the feed the farmer needs to transport.\n\n3. Divide this total weight by the capacity of the truck. Since we're dealing with discrete trips (you can't have part of a trip), round this number up to the nearest whole number if it's not precisely a whole number."

      "content": "The first step is to calculate the total weight of each type of feed. Here's what that looks like:\n\n```python\n# The total weight of the sugar cubes\nsugar_cubes_weight = 20 * 10  # in pounds\n\n# The total weight of the carrots\ncarrots_weight = 40 * 120  # in pounds\n\n# The total weight of the hay\nhay_weight = 420 * 750  # in pounds\n\n# The total weight of the oats\noats_weight = 200 * 650  # in pounds\n```\n\nNext, we'll add all of these weights together to get the total weight of all of the feed:\n\n```python\n# The total weight of all feed\ntotal_weight = sugar_cubes_weight + carrots_weight + hay_weight + oats_weight\n```\n\nFinally, we'll divide the total weight of the feed by the load capacity of the truck. Since we can't have a fraction of a trip, we'll round the result up to the nearest whole number:\n\n```python\nfrom math import ceil\n# The truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time\ntruck_capacity = 22500\n\n# The number of trips needed to transport all feed\nnumber_of_trips = ceil(total_weight / truck_capacity)\n\nprint(number_of_trips)\n```\n\nThe `ceil` function from Python's `math` module rounds up a number to the nearest whole number. Using this function ensures that we're not underestimating the number of trips needed. For example, if the total weight of the feed is 45001 pounds, dividing by the truck's load capacity gives approximately 2.00004. Rounding down to 2 would mean one pound of feed doesn't get transported, so we round up to ensure that all feed is accounted for."
