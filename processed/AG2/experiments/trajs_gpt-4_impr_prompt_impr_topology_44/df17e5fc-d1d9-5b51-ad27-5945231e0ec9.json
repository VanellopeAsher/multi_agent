The other half (50%) of the mural is shared equally among red, white, and purple. This means that each of these colors constitutes one-third of the remaining 50%, making each approximately 16.67% of the total mural.\n3. To find the amount of red paint, you need to calculate 16.67% of the total 12 pints of paint used.\n\nThis approach should effectively answer your query. Please carry on with calculating the exact quantity in pints."

We calculate one-third of 50%, 50% / 3 = 16.67%.\n\n3. To find out the pints of red paint used, we need to find 16.67% of the total paint used, i.e., 12 pints.\n\nLet's calculate this now."
