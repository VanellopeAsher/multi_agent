      "content": "Here is my step-by-step solution:\n\n1. From the problem, we know that:\n   - Combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 0.1 times of one thousand = 100 years.\n   - Paul is 0.1 times of one hundred years older than John = 10 years older.\n   - Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.\n\n2. We can represent every statement in the form of equations as follows:\n   - Let P represents Peter's age, PJ represents Paul's age, J represents John's age.\n   - From the first statement, we have P + PJ + J = 100.\n   - From the second statement, we have PJ = J + 10.\n   - From the third statement, we have P = PJ + J.\n   \n3. Now, we substitute equation 2 (PJ = J + 10) and equation 3 (P = PJ + J) into equation 1 (P + PJ + J = 100):\n\n   J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \n   or equivalently, \n   3J + 20 = 100\n\n4. Solving this equation can find John's age. Once John's age is determined, Peter's age can be found by substitifying John's age into equation 3 (P = PJ + J), and Paul's age can be found by substituting John's age into equation 2 (PJ = J + 10).\n\n5. Finally, check these values satisfies equation 1 (P + PJ + J = 100) to validate the solution. The ages must constitute 100 years  as the condition of the challenge states.\n\nThis plan will help decipher the mathematical solution/model to find the ages of Peter, Paul and John from the problem-based details given."

P = Pj + J\nWe can solve this system of equations using sympy package.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Defining the symbols P, Pj, J\nP, Pj, J = symbols('P Pj J')\n\n# Defining the equations\nequation1 = Eq(P + Pj + J, 100)\nequation2 = Eq(Pj, J + 10)\nequation3 = Eq(P, Pj + J)\n\n# Solving the system of equations\nsolutions = solve((equation1, equation2, equation3), (P, Pj, J))\n\nprint(solutions)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the ages of Peter, Paul, and John."
