Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Next, we would divide each of the 4 parts by 5. This would result in 20 equally sized pieces. \n\n3. The length of each final cut would be the result of these calculations.\n\nWe must have the value or total length of the ribbon to complete this calculation, which isn't provided in the question. Could you provide the total length of the ribbon?"

This value was not provided in the original problem statement; it was simply assumed by Agent Code Executor and used by both agents. Since this value was not explicitly given, we cannot proceed with the calculation as it stands. It would be helpful to know the total ribbon length, and we don't have this information right now.\n\nTherefore, the problem is unsolvable due to the lack of information.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: None"
