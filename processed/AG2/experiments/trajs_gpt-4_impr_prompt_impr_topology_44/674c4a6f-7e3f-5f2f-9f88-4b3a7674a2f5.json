Both the Agent Code Executor and the Agent Problem Solver concur that the grade should be calculated by finding the mean of these scores, an approach that aligns with the information provided in the problem statement. This is accomplished as follows:\n\n1. Sum all of Wilson's scores: 70 + 95 + 88 + 90 + 78 = 421\n2. Divide the sum by the number of scores: 421 / 5 = 84.2\n\nTherefore, Wilson's current math grade is 84.2.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 84.2"
