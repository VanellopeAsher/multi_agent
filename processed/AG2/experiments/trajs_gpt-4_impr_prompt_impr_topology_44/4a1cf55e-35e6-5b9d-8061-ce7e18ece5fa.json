We know a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar, so to find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we subtract $2.5 from the gallon jar's price. That is, $5.5 - $2.5.\n3. Multiply the cost of the gallon jar by the number of gallon jars bought (10 in this case).\n4. Similarly, multiply the cost of the half-gallon jar by the number of half-gallon jars bought (16 in this case).\n5. Finally, add the results from step 3 and step 4 to get the total amount of money she spent.\n\nLet's proceed to calculate it."

All agents concur with this result.\n\nStep by Step Summary:\n1. The cost of a gallon jar is given ($5.5), and the cost of a half-gallon jar is determined by subtracting $2.5 from the cost of a gallon jar, which gives $3.\n2. The total cost for 10 gallon jars is calculated as 10 * $5.5 = $55.\n3. The total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is calculated as 16 * $3 = $48.\n4. The total cost that Cecelia spent is calculated by adding these two amounts together: $55 + $48 = $103. The agents' solutions align, affirming the correctness of the calculations."

The total cost for Cecelia's purchase of 10 gallon jars and 16 half gallon jars is indeed $103, with the price per gallon jar being $5.5 and the price per half-gallon jar being $3. The python code written by Agent Code Executor accurately reflects the logic described by Agent Problem Solver and correctly computes the solution to the problem. This instance once again underscores the efficacy of our team collaboration in solving problems. The problem was accurately solved, and all agents are in agreement on the solution. Our collective output is $103."

The team accurately deduced the cost of each kind of jar using the information provided, then calculated the total amount Cecelia would have spent on both jars. Upon running the python code written by Agent Code Executor to obtain the solution, we found that the total spend was $103. This answer was subsequently verified by Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor, demonstrating perfect agreement across the team. The analysis, execution, and verification process was smooth, displaying high teamwork effectiveness."
