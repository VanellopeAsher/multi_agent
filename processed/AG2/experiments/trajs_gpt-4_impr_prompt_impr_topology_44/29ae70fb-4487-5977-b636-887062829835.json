      "content": "Let's break this down:\n\n1. The total payment for karate classes is $60.\n2. The cost per class if he attends all classes is $60/10 = $6 per class.\n3. Manny's parents have set a limit of $10 per class for karate. \n\nTherefore, Manny can miss some classes and still meet his parents' conditions. He needs to figure out the maximum number of classes he can miss before the cost per attended class exceeds $10. We can use the formula:\n\n60/(10 - number of classes missed) = $ cost per attended class.\n\nNow, we find the number of classes missed where the cost per attended class is more than $10.\n\nLet's solve this equation to get the number of classes Manny can miss."

      "content": "Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have provided their solutions. Let's evaluate these step by step.\n\n1. The original problem statement provides the total cost for the Karate classes ($60), the condition to not exceed a cost of $10 per attended class, and the total number of Karate classes (10). \n2. Agent Problem Solver correctly identified the variables and attempted to establish an equation.\n3. Agent Code Executor then used the equation formulated by Agent Problem Solver to compute the number of classes Manny can miss.\n4. The Python code successfully executes without errors, and gives an output of 4.\n\nHence, if Manny misses 4 classes, the cost per attended class will exceed $10 which his parents wish to avoid. So Manny can miss up to 3 classes before they meet this condition.\n\nBased on the discussion and evaluation, the final solution is:\n \n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{3}**  Manny can miss up to three Karate classes before the cost per class exceeds $10."
