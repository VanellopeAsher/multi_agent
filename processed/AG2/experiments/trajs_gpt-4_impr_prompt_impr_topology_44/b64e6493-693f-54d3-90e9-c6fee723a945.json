      "content": "To solve the problem we need to find out how much money Colby has in total and then divide it by the price of a gumball. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Colby has. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, each dime is worth 10 cents, each nickel is worth 5 cents, and each penny is worth 1 cent. Therefore, the total amount of money Colby has in cents is (80 quarters x 25) + (60 dimes x 10) + (140 nickels x 5) + (150 pennies x 1).\n2. Compute how many gumballs Colby can buy. Each gumball costs 5 cents, so the total amount of money divided by the price would give the number of gumballs."
