Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age 11x, since their ages are presented to us as ratios.\n2. The given problem tells us that the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162. So, we can write the equation 7x + 11x = 162.\n3. Solve the equation for x.\n4. Use the value of x to find Allen's age by multiplying it by 11.\n5. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to Allen's current age.\n\nLet's now move forward to the calculations."

They rightly set up an equation based on the age ratio to find the value of x, which is 9. They then calculated Allen's current age by multiplying x by 11, which gives 99. By adding 10 to Allen's current age of 99, we find that Allen will be 109 years old in ten years. Therefore, the final solution is: \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{109}**."
