      "content": "Here is my step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in February by multiplying 2.8 by 10. We do this because the phrase \"2.8 times of ten days\" tells us how many days there were in the February. \n2. Calculate the daily total number of articles published by both websites combined. We add the average number of political and weather articles (20 per day) published by the first website to the business articles (10 per day) published by its sister company to get the total number of articles published by both websites daily.\n3. Multiply the total articles published daily by both websites, as found in step 2, by the total number of days in February, as found in step 1. This gives us the total number of articles published by both websites in the month of February. \n\nThis method assumes that all numbers given are averages and that they are consistent from day to day throughout the period under study. It also supposes that the publishing rate per day remained constant throughout February. I believe this method should yield an accurate estimation of the total number of articles published under these assumptions."

I will now write a Python code to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in the month of February. \n\nHere is my rationale:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in February: 2.8 * 10.\n2. Calculate the total number of articles each website publishes daily: 20 (for the first website) + 10 (for the second one).\n3. Calculate the total number of articles both websites published in February: daily articles * totalday.\n\nFinally, print the result."

Agent Problem Solver provided a logical step-by-step approach to calculate the total number of articles published by both new websites in February. The solution is correct.\n\n2. Then, Agent Code Executor followed the suggested steps and coded the solution in Python. The code was written correctly, and it printed out the total number of articles as 840.\n\nHence, based on the analysis above and considering the correctness of both the Problem Solver's logic and the Code Executor's output, I determine that 840 is the total number of articles produced by the two companies in February, given that the month composed of 2.8 times of ten days.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently declare the final solution as: \nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{840}."
