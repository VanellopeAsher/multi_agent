  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds\n3. Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds\n4. Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds\n\nThe next step is to add up all the weights to find out the total pounds of food:\n\n2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)\n\nThis sum will provide the total weight of food.\n\nThe problem says that this weight will be transported in 2 trips, so the truck's weight capacity for each trip will be half the total weight of the feed. To find this, we will divide the total weight of the food by 2. The result of this operation will be the truck's weight capacity for each trip.\n"

      "content": "Both Agent_Problem_Solver and Agent_Code_Executor have indeed taken the right steps in order to solve the problem. \n\nHere was their process:\n\n1. Calculate the weight of each kind of feed. They arrived at the following:\n     * Sugar cubes: 2 boxes×1 pound/box = 2 pounds\n     * Carrots: 4 bags ×12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds\n     * Hay: 42 bales ×75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds\n     * Oats: 20 sacks ×65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds\n2. Sum up all the weights to find the total weight:\n     * 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds\n3. Divide the total weight by 2 to represent the 2 trips it takes to transport all the feed. This gives the maximum weight the truck can carry in a single trip.\n     * 4500 pounds / 2 = 2250 pounds\n\nUpon verification, the approach is correctly implemented and yields the correct results. So, the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds of feed per trip."
