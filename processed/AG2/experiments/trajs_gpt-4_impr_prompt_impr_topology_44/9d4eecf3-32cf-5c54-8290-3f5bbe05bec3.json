Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard.\n\nWe can form the following equations:\n\nLet's denote:\nRch = the number of cherries Richard has,\nJch = the number of cherries Jerry has,\nRbch = the number of cherries Robert has. \n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n\n1. Rbch = 3000 (Robert has 3000 cherries),\n2. Rbch = Rch + 1000 (Robert has 1000 more cherries than Richard),\n3. Rch + Jch + Rbch = 6000 (they altogether have 6000 cherries).\n\nIt's a system of linear equations. We can solve this system to find the number of cherries each person has and then we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. \n\nStep 1: solve Rch from the equation (2):\nRch = Rbch - 1000.\n\nStep 2: substitute Rch in the equation (3):\nRch + Jch + Rbch = 6000,\n(Rbch - 1000) + Jch + Rbch = 6000,\n2*Rbch + Jch = 7000.\n\nStep 3: solve Jch from equation (4):\nJch = 7000 - 2*Rbch.\n\nSubstituting the initial value of Rbch (Rbch = 3000), we get the final number of cherries Jerry has.  \n\nStep 4: find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:\ndifference = Rbch - Jch.  \n\nLet's execute this exact scenario."
