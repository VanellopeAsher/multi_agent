This means Billy works for 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.\n\nIf Billy works 3 hours per day, the total hours he works in all these days is 40 * 3 = 120 hours.\n\nGiven that Billy helps 240 people in total, the number of people he helps per hour is hence 240 / 120 = 2 people per hour. This is the answer."

After finding this value, they calculated the number of days Billy works based on him taking 20% of the days off. Multiplying these working days by the daily working hours (3 hours), they obtained the total number of hours Billy worked. Lastly, they divided the total number of people he helped (240 people) by the total number of hours he worked. Both found that Billy helps 2 people per hour. \n\nBoth solutions are correct and congruent. Their methods match, calculation steps are accurate, and the final answer is the same: Billy helps 2 people per hour. Good job, team!"

Calculating the total number of days between March 1 and April 19, then adjusting it by the working rate of 80% gave us the working days. Multiplying the working days by the daily work hours gave us the total working hours. Finally, dividing the total number of helped people by the total working hours produced the correct answer. The number of people Billy helps per hour is found to be 2. Therefore, the final solution is:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2}**."
