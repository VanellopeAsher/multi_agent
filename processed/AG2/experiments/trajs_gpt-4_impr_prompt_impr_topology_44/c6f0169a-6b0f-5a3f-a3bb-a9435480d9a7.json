Determine the number of automatic cars (12), the number of manual cars (4), and the number of semi-automatic cars (20 - 12 - 4 = 4).\n3. Calculate the number of unavailable cars, which includes the automatic cars that are rented out (3) and the manual cars under maintenance (2).\n4. Subtract the number of unavailable cars from the total number of cars to get the number of available cars (20 - 3 - 2 = 15).\n5. Determine the number of semi-automatic cars among the available cars, which would still be 4 as semi-automatic cars didn't have any changes.\n6. Calculate the percentage of the semi-automatic cars among the available cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of available cars and multiplying by 100 ((4/15) * 100% = 26.67%). \n\nTherefore, 26.67% of the remaining cars available for rent are semi-automatic."

Here we are given that there are 12 automatic and 4 manual cars. We can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the sum of the automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars. So there are 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.\n3. Then we need to figure out how many cars are currently available. We know that 3 automatic cars are rented and 2 manual cars are under maintenance, so 5 cars are not available. Therefore, we currently have 20 - 5 = 15 available cars.\n4. After that we need to identify the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available cars. This can be done by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of available cars and multiplying by 100. This will give us (4 / 15) * 100 = 26.67%.\n\nLet's execute this in code."
