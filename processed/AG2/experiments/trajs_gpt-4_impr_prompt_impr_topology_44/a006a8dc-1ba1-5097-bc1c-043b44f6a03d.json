      "content": "We can solve the problem through the following steps:\n\n1. First, determine the number of boys and girls. Since it was stated that the children were divided into equal groups, we divide the total number of children (20 kids) by 2. This gives us 10 boys and 10 girls. \n\n2. Next, we find the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Per the information given, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.\n\n3. The next step is to calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl. It was stated that the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys. Hence, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 600 shells + 4.5 * 600 shells = 600 shells + 2700 shells = 3300 shells.\n\n4. Finally, to determine the number of shells brought by each girl, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls (3300 shells) by the number of girls, which is 10. Therefore, each girl brought back 3300 shells / 10 girls = 330 shells. \n\nSo, each girl brought back 330 seashells. "
