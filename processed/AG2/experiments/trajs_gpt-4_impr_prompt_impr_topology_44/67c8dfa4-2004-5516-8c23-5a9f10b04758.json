      "content": "To solve this problem, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. We first need to figure out how many bags Tara sold in total to make her profit. Since she sold each painted bag for $8 and made a profit of $160, she would have sold $160/$8 = 20 bags.\n2. Each pack purchased by Tara contains 5 bags. To get the number of packs, we divide the total number of bags by the number of bags in each pack. So, she bought 20/5 = 4 packs. \n\nSo Tara bought 4 packs of 5 canvas bags."

Let's write a Python program to solve this.\n\n- First, let's calculate the total profit ($160) divided by the selling price of each bag ($8) to find out the total number of bags sold.\n- Then, let's divide the total number of bags sold by the number of bags in each pack (5) to find out the number of packs bought.\n\n```python\n# calculate the total number of bags sold\ntotal_bags_sold = 160 / 8\n\n# calculate the total number of packs bought\ntotal_packs_bought = total_bags_sold / 5\n\nprint(total_packs_bought)\n```\nSo, Tara bought 4 packs of 5 canvas bags.
