      "content": "First, let's calculate the number of sports cards Miss Maria has. The total number of basketball cards she has is the product of the number of decks and the number of basketball cards per deck. Similarly, the total number of baseball cards she has is the product of the number of boxes and the number of baseball cards per box. We add these to the number of rare soccer cards she has. \n\nNext, she keeps some cards for herself, and we subtract these from the total number of cards to find out how many she gives away to her students.\n\nFinally, divide the number of cards that she gives away by the number of cards that each student received. This will give us the number of students.\n\nStep by Step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of basketball cards: number of decks * number of cards per deck = cards\n2. Calculate the number of baseball cards: number of boxes * number of cards per box = cards\n3. Find the total number of cards: basketball cards + baseball cards + rare soccer cards = total cards\n4. Calculate how many cards she gives away: total cards - cards she kept = cards given away\n5. Divide the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student gets to find the number of students: cards given away / cards per student = students. The result will gives the total number of students getting the cards."

      "content": "Alright. Let's implement the solution outlined by Agent_Problem_Solver\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many cards Miss Maria collects:\n\n- We multiply the number of basketball decks (6) by the number of cards in each deck (25). This gives us the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has.\n- We multiply the number of baseball boxes (5) by the number of cards in each box (40). This gives us the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has.\n- Then, we add these to the number of rare soccer cards she has (30) to get the total number of cards Miss Maria collects.\n\nHowever, Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself. We subtract this number from the total number of cards.\n\nTo find out the number of students Miss Maria has, we divide the remaining number of cards by the number of cards each student got (10).\n\nFinally, we print out the total number of students. Let's write this in Python code."
