Calculate the amount of time John spent watching shows and use that to figure out the total time he spent on vacation.\n3. Use the total time and the percentage of time he spent sightseeing to find out how much time he spent sightseeing."

Calculate the total time spent watching shows.\n3. Add the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows to get the total time spent on known activities.\n4. Since the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time spent on vacation, calculate the total time spent on vacation.\n5. The time spent sightseeing is 40% of the total time spent on vacation, calculate the time spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this."

Upon running the python code, Agent Code Executor has proposed that John spent approximately 23.2 hours sightseeing.\n\nIn terms of interpretation, it appears that approximately is justified given that the calculation output is `23.200000000000003`. This minute discrepancy is likely due to the nature of computer calculations and doesn't have a huge impact on the overall finding.\n\nHence, based on the analysis, it can be determined that John spent approximately 23.2 hours sightseeing during his vacation.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** **(23.2)**"
