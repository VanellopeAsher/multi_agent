      "content": "To solve this problem:\n\n1. Figure out how many days are in 12 weeks. Since we know that each week consists of 7 days and we have 12 weeks in total, we multiply 12 weeks by 7 days/week to get a total of 84 days.\n\n2. Determine how many eggs Claire eats every day. Since we know that she makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, Claire eats 3 eggs per day.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of eggs she will eat in 12 weeks. To do this, multiply the number of days in 12 weeks (84 days) by the eggs she eats daily (3 eggs/day) to get a total of 252 eggs.\n\n4. Determine how many dozen eggs that amounts to. Since we know that each dozen consists of 12 eggs, we divide the total eggs by 12. So, 252 eggs divided by 12 eggs/dozen equals to 21 dozen eggs.\n\nSo Claire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks."

Calculate the total number of eggs Claire will eat. Since Claire eats 3 eggs every day, over 84 days she will eat 3 * 84 = 252 eggs.\n\n3. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs. Since a dozen is 12, Claire will eat 252 / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs.\n\nStep 1 and 2 gives the total number of eggs and divide it by 12 to get it in dozens. Let's implement this in code."
