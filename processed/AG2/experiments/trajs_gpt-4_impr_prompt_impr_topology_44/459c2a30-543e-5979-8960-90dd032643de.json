Since there are 4 more blue squares than red, it means there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.\n\n3. It's given that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.\n\n4. From these, we can find the total number of red, blue, and green squares, which is 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) = 56.\n\n5. The total area of the quilted comforter is 68 square feet. This means the number of white squares is 68 (total) - 56 (red, blue, and green) = 12.\n\n6. To find out how much fewer the white squares are than the green squares, we subtract the number of white squares from the green squares, which is 24 (green) - 12 (white) = 12. \n\nSo, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares."

They first calculated the number of each colored squares according to the problem statement, then computed the total number of the red, blue, and green squares. The total area of the comforter was given as 68 square feet, so by subtracting the total number of red, blue, and green squares from this, they found the number of white squares. Then, they calculated the difference between green squares and white squares, which is indeed 12, as shown by both their results. \n\nTherefore, after verifying the solutions provided, I can confidently say that the final solution to this problem is 12. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}**"
