      "content": "This problem can be solved using the following steps:\n\n1. Establish the relationship between Carver's age and his son's age. According to the problem, Carver's age is \"15 years less than ten times the age of his son.\"\n\n2. Translate this relationship to a mathematical equation. Here, Carver's age is represented as C and his son's age as S. The relationship can be represented algebraically as:\n\n    C = 10S - 15\n\n3. Given that Carver's age (C) is 45 years, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n    45 = 10S - 15\n\n4. Solve the equation for S, which represents the son's age:\n\n    Move -15 to the other side by adding 15 to both sides of the equation, we get\n\n    45 + 15 = 10S\n\n    Simplifying that yields\n\n    60 = 10S\n\n5. Then, divide both sides of the equation by 10:\n\n    S = 60 / 10\n    \n    Simplifying that gives:\n\n    S = 6\n\n6. Therefore, Carver's son is 6 years old."
