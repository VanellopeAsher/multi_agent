The coral pieces cost $2.00 each, and she bought three pieces, so $2.00 * 3 = $6.00.\n4. The fish cost $0.50 each, and she bought 20 fish, so $0.50 * 20 = $10.00.\n5. Finally, the fish food cost $2.00.\n\nNow, let's add all the costs together:\n\n$10.00 (fish tank) + $5.00 (stones) + $6.00 (coral pieces) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = Total spent.\n\nLet's calculate the total now."

They broke down the problem into individual purchases, correctly multiplying the price per unit by the number of units purchased.\n\n2. They then calculated the total spent by adding the costs of individual items.\n\nThe Python execution resulted in a total of $33.00, which confirms Agent Problem Solver's analysis. Therefore, I can validate that the total amount Scarlett spent is indeed $33.00. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{33.00}"
