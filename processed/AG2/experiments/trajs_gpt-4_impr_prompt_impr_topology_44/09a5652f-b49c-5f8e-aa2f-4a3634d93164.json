Determine the total time John spends running each week:\n    - Since he runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days, his total running time each week would be 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.\n\n2. Calculate his speed using the formula: speed = distance / time\n    - This can be calculated by dividing the total distance John runs each week (60 miles) by his total running time each week (6 hours).\n\n3.

To solve the problem, they first calculated the total time John spent running each week by adding the hours he ran: 3 hours on the first day and 1.5 hours on both the second and third days, obtaining a total of 6 hours. Subsequently, they calculated his speed using the formula: speed = distance / time. So, after running for a total distance of 60 miles, John's speed was ascertained to be 10 mph. Therefore, the agent's finding is that John runs at a speed of 10 mph."

They then divided the total miles (60 miles) by the total running time (6 hours), yielding a running speed of 10 mph.\n\nTherefore, the final solution to the problem is: John runs at a speed of 10 mph.\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10}."
