      "content": "Here is my approach to solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem - We are given that 60 potatoes make 360 hash browns. We need to find out how many hash browns 960 potatoes would make. This seems like a simple proportional relationship.\n\nStep 2: Identify the proportion - From the given information, we know that 1 potato makes 360/60 = 6 hash browns.\n\nStep 3: Apply the proportion to the new question - Since we know that 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, we can multiply 960 (the number of potatoes) by 6 (the number of hash browns per potato) to find out how many hash browns can be made from 960 potatoes.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the result - Perform the multiplication to get the answer.\n\nThat's how I would solve this problem."

To find the proportion, we can divide the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes. This value can then be multiplied by 960 to find the number of hash browns made from 960 potatoes.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Find the proportion of potatoes to hash browns\nhash_browns_per_potato = 360 / 60\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the proportion by 960 to find the number of hash browns\nhash_browns = hash_browns_per_potato * 960\n\nprint(hash_browns)\n```"

First, they understood that this is a problem of proportionality, where the number of hash browns made, is proportional to the number of potatoes used.\n2. They found the ratio of potatoes to hash browns by dividing the given number of hash browns (360) by the given number of potatoes (60), giving us 6 hash browns per potato.\n3. This ratio was then multiplied by the new number of potatoes (960), giving us the number of hash browns that can be made from these potatoes.\n\nThe python code executed by Agent Code Executor correctly used this approach to find the solution, which is 5760 hash browns from 960 potatoes. Therefore, the answer is 5760."
