      "content": "Let's denote:\n\n- The number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday as M. We know from the problem description that M = 5.\n- The number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday as T. According to the problem, T = 7 (which is 2/5 times more than the number of articles written on Monday).\n- The number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday as W. We don't yet know this number.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can establish two equations based on the information provided in the problem:\n\n1. The total time Meredith spent writing over the three days is 104 hours: 4M + 4T + 4W = 104.\n2. The number of articles written on Wednesday was a certain times more than the number written on Tuesday: W = kT, where k is the number we're trying to find.\n\nWe can now substitute 5 for M and 7 for T in the first equation and simplify to find W:\n\n4M + 4T + 4W = 104\n20 + 28 + 4W = 104\n4W = 104 - 20 - 28\n4W = 56\nW = 56 / 4\nW = 14\n\nWe now substitute 7 for T in the second equation and solve for k:\n\nW = kT\n14 = k7\nk = 14 / 7\nk = 2\n\nSo, Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday."

      "content": "We will solve this problem as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of articles written on Monday and Tuesday.\n2. Convert this total into the time used to write them since we know one article takes 4 hours to complete.\n3. Subtract the total time used on Monday and Tuesday from the provided total time (104 hours) to find the time used on Wednesday.\n4. Since we know 4 hours equals one article, we can convert the Wednesday time into the number of articles.\n5. Finally, divide the number of Wednesday articles over the number of Tuesday articles to get the ratio.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Number of articles written on Monday\nM = 5\n\n# Number of articles written on Tuesday (2/5 times more than Monday)\nT = M + (2/5 * M)\n\n# Time spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday\ntime_mon_tue = 4 * (M + T)\n\n# Total time spent writing is 104 hours, so find the time spent on Wednesday\ntime_wed = 104 - time_mon_tue\n\n# As 4 hours is used to write each article, the number of articles written on Wednesday is time_wed/4\nW = time_wed / 4\n\n# The number of articles written on Wednesday as a ratio of the articles written on Tuesday\nratio = W / T\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
