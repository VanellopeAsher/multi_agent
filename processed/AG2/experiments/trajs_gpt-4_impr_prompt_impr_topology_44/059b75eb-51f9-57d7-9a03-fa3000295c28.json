After a day of intense rainfall, the water volume becomes twice as much. So, we multiply the initial volume (4000 gallons) by 2 to find the volume after the first day. \n3. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow. So, we add this amount to the volume of water from the second day to find the total water volume on the third day. \n\nThis procedure will work for any initial water volume, rainfall amplification factor, and additional water volume. I'll await the equivalent code solution before I demonstrate the calculation with numerical values."

After a day of intense rainfall, the volume becomes twice as much. So, we multiply the initial volume by 2: \n   Volume after first day = 4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons\n3. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added to the flow: \n   Total volume on third day = Volume after second day + additional volume = 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons\n\nSo, there are 14000 gallons of water flowing through that point in the river on the third day."
