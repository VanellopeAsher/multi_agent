She made 20 cards, and it's stated that her father brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, but the number of cards in each box is not stated. \n\nI am unable to establish an accurate total without this information. \n\nErica gave out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, which sums up to 29 cards she no longer has. She also received 17 cards. \n\nTo find out the total number of cards Erica now has, I'll need to know how many cards were in each box her dad gave her. Can you please provide that information?"

Otherwise,  I can't write appropriate Python code to solve this problem. Could you please provide the number of cards in each box?"
