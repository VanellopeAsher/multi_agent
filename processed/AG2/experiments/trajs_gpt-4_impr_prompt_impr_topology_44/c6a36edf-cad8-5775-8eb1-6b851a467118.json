Determine the total number of crayon muffins that Kate can make.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money she can earn by selling these crayon muffins.\n\nFirst, we know that each container of crayons contained 64 crayons. Since all of these crayons were reduced to fragments, we can assume that one crayon equals one fragment. Therefore, she has 3 containers * 64 crayons per container = 192 crayon fragments in total.\n\nNext, we know that she makes each crayon muffin using 8 fragments. So, she can make a total of 192 fragments / 8 fragments per muffin = 24 crayon muffins.\n\nFinally, as each crayon muffin can be sold for $1.50, she can earn a total of 24 muffins * $1.50 per muffin = $36.00"
