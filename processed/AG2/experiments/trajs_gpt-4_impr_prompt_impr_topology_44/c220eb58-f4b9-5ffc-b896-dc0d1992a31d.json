Ms. Thompson received 84 messages. So, we multiply 84 by 1/3 to find out how many messages were delivered to Mr. Yu.\n\nOnce we have the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu, we can find the total number of messages delivered by adding the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu."
