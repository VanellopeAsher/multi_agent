      "content": "Now, let's evaluate the proposed solution:\n\n1. Mrs. Rylan purchased 20 packets of tomato seeds, each costing $40. The total cost of these is therefore 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.\n2. She also bought 80 packets of celery seeds, each priced at $30. The total cost for these is thus 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.\n3. By adding up the two amounts, we find that Mrs. Rylan spent $800 (for tomato seeds) + $2400 (for celery seeds) = $3200 in total on the seeds.\n\nConsidering the correctness of the calculated amounts for both the tomato and celery seeds packets, and given the successful execution of Agent Code Executor's Python code (which produced the output 3200), I can confirm that Mrs. Rylan spent $3200 in total for the purchases.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3200}**. This amount is in dollar units, as per the provided price information in the problem statement."
