First, count the number of lines for each part that is his. \n   He has 54 lines in the lyrics of his solo song. \n   In the first scene, his part has one third of the lines, and the scene is twice the song, meaning his lines are (1/3) * 2 * 54 = 36.\n   In the second scene, he has four-fifths of all lines, and the scene has six more lines than the song, meaning his lines are (4/5) * (54 + 6) = 48.\n\n2. Add the extra 15 lines he has to cover due to the missing actor.\n\n3. Sum all the lines to get the total number of lines he needs to memorize. \n\nLet's call for Agent_Code_Executor to help verify this with code."

Then calculate the number of lines for his first scene, which is (1/3) * 2 * 54.\n3. Next, calculate the number of lines for his second scene, which is (4/5) * (54 + 6).\n4. Also, remember to add the 15 extra lines he needs to memorize.\n5. Finally, sum all the lines to get the total number of lines he needs to memorize. \n\nLet's proceed:\n\n```python\n# define number of lines for his song\nlines_song = 54\n\n# calculate lines for first scene\nlines_scene1 = (1/3) * 2 * lines_song\n\n# calculate lines for second scene\nlines_scene2 = (4/5) * (lines_song + 6)\n\n# lines for the missing actor\nlines_missing_actor = 15\n\n# total lines he needs to memorize\ntotal_lines = lines_song + lines_scene1 + lines_scene2 + lines_missing_actor\n\nprint(total_lines)\n``` \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
