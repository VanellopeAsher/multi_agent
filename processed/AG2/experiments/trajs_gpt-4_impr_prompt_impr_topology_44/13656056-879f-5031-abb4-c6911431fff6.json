Since a week contains seven days, this can be done by multiplying $300 (his daily pay) by 7.\n2. Subtract the total amount Gerald spent, which is $1000, from his total earnings for the week to find out how much he has left. \n\nNow, let's hand over to Agent_Code_Executor for the actual computation."

First, I will calculate the total earnings Gerald makes in a week by multiplying his daily wage ($300) by the number of days in a week (7).\n2. Then, I will calculate how much Gerald has left after spending $1000 by subtracting the total amount spent from his total weekly earnings. \n\nThis can be achieved following this Python code:\n\n```python\n# Daily wage in dollars\ndaily_wage = 300 \n\n# Number of days in a week \nnum_days = 7 \n\n# Total amount spent in dollars\ntotal_spent = 1000 \n\n# Total weekly earnings\nweekly_earnings = daily_wage * num_days \n\n# Amount left after spending\namount_left = weekly_earnings - total_spent\n\nprint(amount_left)\n```\n\nLet's execute the Python code to obtain Gerald's balance after a week of work and expenses."
