      "content": "To find out the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of steps Elliott took to and from school: Elliott completed half of his steps during this walk, so that is 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps.\n2. Then add the number of steps he took during his walk with a friend and shopping: 5,000 steps (school) + 1,000 steps (friend) + 500 steps (shopping) = 6,500 steps.\n3. Since we know that Elliott had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can subtract this from the total daily goal of 10,000 steps. So, 10,000 steps (daily goal) - 2,000 steps (remaining) = 8,000 steps.\n4. To find out how many steps Elliott did during his jog, subtract the total steps done before the jog (6,500 steps) from the total steps done after the jog (8,000 steps). So, 8,000 steps - 6,500 steps = 1,500 steps. \n\nSo, Elliott took 1,500 steps during his jog."
