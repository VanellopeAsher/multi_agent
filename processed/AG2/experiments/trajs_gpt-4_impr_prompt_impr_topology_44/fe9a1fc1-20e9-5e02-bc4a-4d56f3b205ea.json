      "content": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many cookies Katarina has by decoding the information given. It is stated that Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies, meaning she has 6.8 * 10 = 68 cookies.\n\n2. Determine the number of cookies Max has by adding the value of cookies Katarina has with the difference between Max's cookies and Katarina's cookies. It is stated that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max's cookies = 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.\n\n3. Determine how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. This can be done by calculating the reverse of how Max's cookies are calculated. Since Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies by = (73 - 10) / 1.2 = 52.5 cookies.\n\n4. Lastly, compute how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's cookies since it is stated that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, Summer has = 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.\n\n5. Add the number of cookies everyone has to find the total. Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies = 68 + 73 + 52.5 + 96 = 289.5 cookies.\n\nSo, in total, they have 289.5 cookies. The .5 could possibly stem from a cookie being shared or split."
