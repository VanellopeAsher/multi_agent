We know 1 quarter equals 25 cents and 1 dime equals 10 cents.\n   So, Kelly has 5 * 25 (quarters) + 2 * 10 (dimes) cents = 125 + 20 cents. \n\n2. Calculate the amount Kelly spent. She bought a can of pop for 55 cents and a candy bar for 45 cents. \n   So, Kelly spent 55 (pop) + 45 (candy bar) cents = 100 cents.\n\n3. Calculate the remaining amount Kelly is left with after the purchase.\n   From step 1, Kelly had 145 cents initially.\n   From step 2, she spent 100 cents.\n   So, remaining cents = initial cents - spent cents = 145 - 100. \n\nThe calculated value from step 3 will be the amount of cents Kelly is left with."

We did this by converting the quarters and dimes to cents (since 1 quarter is 25 cents and 1 dime is 10 cents). The total came to 145 cents.\n\nKelly spent 100 cents on a can of pop and a candy bar (55 cents and 45 cents respectively).\n\nWe then subtracted the amount spent (100 cents) from the initial amount (145 cents), which gave us 45 cents. \n\nTherefore, Kelly is left with 45 cents."

The conversion was performed considering that 1 quarter is equivalent to 25 cents and 1 dime is equivalent to 10 cents. It resulted in 145 cents.\n\n2. Kelly spent 55 cents on a can of pop and 45 cents on a candy bar, which totals to 100 cents. \n\n3. The total money spent was subtracted from the initial total amount Kelly had. \n\nHence, Kelly is left with 45 cents. \n\nThe Python code and logic used to solve the problem are correct."
