      "content": "Agent Problem Solver's Solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total for the first half of the year: Since Aleena pays $200 each month, and there are 6 months in half a year, the total amount for the first half of the year would be 200 * 6 = $1200.\n\n2. Calculate the discount for the second half of the year: The streaming service decreased the price by 15% for the second half of the year. To calculate this amount, we can find 15% of $200, which is (15/100) * 200 = $30. Therefore, Aleena pays 200 - 30 = $170 each month for the second half of the year.\n\n3. Calculate the total for the second half of the year: With the new monthly price of $170 and 6 months in half a year, the total for the second half of the year is 170 * 6 = $1020.\n\n4. Calculate the total for the year: To find the total amount Aleena paid for the year, we add the total for the first half of the year and the total for the second half of the year, which is 1200 + 1020 = $2220.\n\nThus, Aleena paid $2220 for the streaming service by the end of the year."
