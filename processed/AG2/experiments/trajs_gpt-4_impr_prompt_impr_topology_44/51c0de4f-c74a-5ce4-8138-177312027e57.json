The lawyer offered to donate three times as much as everyone else, so he must have donated three times the $2000 Walter had collected. Therefore, the lawyer was expected to donate 3 * $2000 = $6000. \n3. But the lawyer donated a total of $6600, which is $600 more than expected. This extra amount of donation must be three times the amount Walter's friend gave. \n4. Therefore, the amount Walter's friend must have given is $600 / 3 = $200.\n\nSo, Walter's friend gave him $200."
