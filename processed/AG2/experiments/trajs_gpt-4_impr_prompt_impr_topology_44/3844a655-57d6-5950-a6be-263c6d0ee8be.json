The cost for the first venue is a flat fee of $2000 + $50 for each guest. For the second venue, the cost is $250 per guest.\n\n2. To find out when these costs would be equal, we can set up the equation: \n   2000 + 50 * G = 250 * G\n   Here, G stands for the number of guests. \n\n3. Finally, solve the equation for G to get the number of guests at which the costs are equal. \n\nThis way we can find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost. Let's proceed to the calculation part to get the answer."

Agent Code Executor implemented this proposed solution in Python using sympy, a well-regarded library for symbolic computation. The Python code successfully declares the variable, sets up and solves the equation.\n\nBased on the given problem, both agents concluded that the costs of both venues would be equal if there are exactly 13 guests.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{13}**"
