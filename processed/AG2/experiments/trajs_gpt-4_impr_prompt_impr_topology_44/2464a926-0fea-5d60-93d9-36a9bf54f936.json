The code calculates the total number of balloons prepared by multiplying the number of sets by the number of balloons in each set. Then it calculates the number of balloons used by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total number of balloons prepared. \n\nThe code produced a result of 288, which means that 288 balloons were used in the water balloon fight.\n\nHence, the final solution is: \n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{288}** balloons were used in their water balloon battle."
