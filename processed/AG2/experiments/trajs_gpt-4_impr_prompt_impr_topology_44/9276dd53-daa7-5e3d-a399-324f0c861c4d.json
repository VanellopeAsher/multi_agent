So if we have 2000 helmets, we have 2000/2 = 1000 robots.\n2. The problem also states that there are half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore, if we have 2000 helmets, we must have 2 * 2000 = 4000 footballs.\n3. So, to find the total number of items, we just add the number of robots, helmets and footballs. \n\nTotal items = number of robots + number of helmets + number of footballs\n\nLet's calculate that."
