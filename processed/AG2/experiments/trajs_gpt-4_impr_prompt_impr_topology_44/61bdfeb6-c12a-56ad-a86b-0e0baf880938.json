So, we multiply the total TVs sold by these fractions:\n\n- For smart TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/4.\n- For analog TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/8.\n- For projection TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/5.\n\nThen, we sum up these results to find the total number of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs sold.\nFinally, we subtract this total from 40 TVs to find the amount of OLED TVs sold."

After reviewing them, I agree with their approach and the calculations seem correct. \n\nThey calculated the amount of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs sold by multiplying the total TVs sold with the corresponding fractions. After summing up these numbers, they subtracted that from the total TVs sold to find the amount of OLED TVs sold. The resulting value is 17.\n\nTherefore, Samwell was able to sell 17 OLED TVs in his appliance store in a week. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{17}**."
