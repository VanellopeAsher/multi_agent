This would involve adding the cost of the pots to the cost of the garden soil.\n\nNext, subtract the discount value from the cumulative cost obtained in step one. The result will be the total sum of money the mother spent at the gardening store. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\nStep 1: Add the cost of the pots ($19) to the cost of the garden soil ($26).\n             This gives a total of $45.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the discount value ($7) from the total value obtained in step one ($45).\n             Subtracting 7 from 45 gives a total of $38. \n\nHence, the total amount of money the mother spent at the gardening store was $38."

      "content": "Following the steps proposed by Agent Problem Solver, here is the python code to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, I will define all the costs presented in the problem: the cost of the pots, the cost of the garden soil, and the value of the discount voucher.\n2. Then, I will calculate the total cost before the discount by adding the cost of the pots to the cost of the soil.\n3. Finally, I will calculate the final cost after the discount by subtracting the value of the discount from the total cost before the discount. Let's execute these steps:\n\n```python\n# the cost of the pots\ncost_pots = 19  \n\n# the cost of the garden soil\ncost_soil = 26  \n\n# the value of the discount voucher\ndiscount = 7  \n\n# the total cost before the discount\ntotal_before_discount = cost_pots + cost_soil  \n\n# the final cost after the discount\nfinal_cost = total_before_discount - discount  \nprint(final_cost)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total cost after the discount. The 'print' statement at the end of the script will display this final cost."
