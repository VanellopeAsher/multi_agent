Calculate the number of hours worked on Wednesday. The problem describes this as double the hours worked on Tuesday. Therefore, we multiply Tuesday's hours (5) by 2 to get the number of hours worked on Wednesday.\n3. Calculate the number of hours worked on Thursday. The problem describes this as 2 hours less than the work duration on Wednesday, so deduct 2 from the number of hours worked on Wednesday.\n4. Finally, sum the work hours of all three days to achieve the total number of hours Bruce has worked over these three days. \n\nNow, let's move forward with these calculations."
