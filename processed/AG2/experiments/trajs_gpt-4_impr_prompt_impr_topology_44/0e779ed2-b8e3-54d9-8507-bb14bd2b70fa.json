In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Let's first calculate the age of each sibling individually:\n\n1. Since all sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten, each sister is 1.6 * 10 = 16 years old. As there are 3 sisters, the total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48 years.\n\n2. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, so his age is 3/5 * 20 = 12 years.\n\n3. The other brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so he is 2 * 12 = 24 years.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total age by adding up the ages of all the siblings: 48 (for the sisters) + 12 (for the younger brother) + 24 (for the older brother) = 84 years. So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years.\n"

This gives us a total of 3*16 = 48 years for all the sisters. \n\nOne brother is 3/5 of 20 years, which translates to 12 years.\nThe other brother is said to be half the age of the older brother, making him 24 years old.\n\nWe can add up these ages to get the total combined years of the siblings.\n\nLet's calculate using Python."
