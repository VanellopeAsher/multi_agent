  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "Here's the step-by-step plan to solve this problem algebraically:\n\n1. Define the problem's variables: \n    - Let Friday's number of car tyre repairs be C2.\n2. Set up the equation: \n    - According to the problem, the mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The Thursday earnings were $60*6 + $40*4. The Friday earnings were $40*C2. This gives us the equation: $60*6 + $40*4 = $40*C2 + 40.\n3. Rearrange the equation and solve for C2: \n    - Subtract 40 from both sides to get $60*6 + $40*4 - 40 = $40*C2. \n    - Therefore, the solution will be C2 = ($60*6 + $40*4 - 40) / $40. \n\nThis solution will provide the number of car tires the mechanic repairs on Friday."
