      "content": "Firstly, let's calculate how many smores are needed in total. Each child wants 2 smores, so for 9 children that's 9*2 = 18 smores. Each adult wants 1 smore, so for 6 adults that's 6*1 = 6 smores. Therefore, in total, 18 + 6 = 24 smores are needed.\n\nSecondly, let's calculate how many smores we can get from one box. Each packet makes 8 smores and a box contains 3 packets, so one box makes 8*3 = 24 smores.\n\nComparing the total smores needed and the quantity produced by one box, we can see that one box will exactly meet the needs of the whole group. Therefore, 1 box of graham crackers is necessary."
