This gives 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of cards in each box. This gives 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards.\n\nStep 3: Sum the total number of basketball and baseball cards to get the overall total number of sports cards that Miss Maria has. \n\nStep 4: Subtract the number of cards that Miss Maria kept from the total number of cards. This gives the number of cards given to the students.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student received. \n\nThis will give us the total number of Miss Maria's students."

According to Agent Problem Solver, Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards each. That makes 6*25=150 basketball cards which is correct.\n   \n2. Then Miss Maria has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards each. That makes 5*40=200 baseball cards. This is correct.\n   \n3. Adding the total basketball and baseball cards, Miss Maria has 150+200=350 cards in total, which is correct.\n   \n4. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards and gives the rest to her students, which means she gives out 350-50=300 cards to her students. This is correct.\n   \n5. If each student got 10 cards, the number of students can be calculated as 300/10=30. This is correct.\n   \nThe solution proposed by the Agent Code Executor is also correct, returning a result of 30 students.\n\nFINAL SOLUTION: Miss Maria has **30** students.\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{30}**"
