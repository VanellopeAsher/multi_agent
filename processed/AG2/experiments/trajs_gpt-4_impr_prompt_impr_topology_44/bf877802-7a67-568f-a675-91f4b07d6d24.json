      "content": "Since the sun is initially moving upward at a rate of 5 degrees an hour for 10 hours, this translates to a total movement of 5 * 10 = 50 degrees. So, at the end of the 10th hour, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 (initial angle) + 50 = 82 degrees.\n\nAfter 10 hours, the rate of the sun's movement changes to 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours, leading to an additional upward movement of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Adding this to the previous total, we find that the total angle from the ground to the sun after the entire time period will be 82 (after 10 hours) + 6 = 88 degrees. Therefore, there will be 88 degrees from the ground to the sun."
