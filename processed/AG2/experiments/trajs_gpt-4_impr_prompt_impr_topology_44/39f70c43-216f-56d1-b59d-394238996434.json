In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate the total cost of hamburgers by multiplying the price of a hamburger ($4) by the number of hamburgers (5).\n2.

Note that the cost for cans of juices isn't mentioned. We can't proceed until we have the cost for the cans of fruit drinks.\n4. Once we have the total cost for everything, subtract the total cost from the fifty-dollar bill Carly has. This will result in the change she will get back."
