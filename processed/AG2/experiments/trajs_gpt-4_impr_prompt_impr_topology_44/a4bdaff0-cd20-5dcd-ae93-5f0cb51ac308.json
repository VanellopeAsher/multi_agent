      "content": "I suggest we tackle this problem by first calculating Jessica's total minimum monthly payment. This can be done by adding the minimum monthly payments for each of her debts: the student loans, credit card, and mortgage. \n\nOnce we have that, we can calculate 50% more of that figure to find out how much Jessica wants to pay per month.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, we can find out the total yearly payment by multiplying the monthly payment Jessica wants to make by 12.\n\nThe steps would be as follows:\n 1. Add up the three minimum payments to get the total minimum payment per month.\n 2. Calculate 50% more of the total minimum payment to get Jessica's monthly payment. \n 3. Multiply Jessica's monthly payment by 12 to get the total payment for the year. \n\nLet's assign the values:\n\nStudent loans minimum payment = $3000/month\nCredit card minimum payment = $2000/month\nMortgage minimum payment = $5000/month\n\nThen proceed with the calculations."

The calculations were performed correctly:\n1. The total minimum monthly payment was calculated by adding the three individual minimum payments.\n2. Jessica's increased (by 50%) monthly payment was calculated by multiplying the total minimum monthly payment by 1.5.\n3. The annual cost was determined by multiplying Jessica's monthly payment by 12.\n\nTherefore, by following these steps, Agent Code Executor computed a total annual payment of $180,000. Hence, as I confirm the correctness of this solution, **SOLUTION_FOUND** is \\boxed{180000}."
