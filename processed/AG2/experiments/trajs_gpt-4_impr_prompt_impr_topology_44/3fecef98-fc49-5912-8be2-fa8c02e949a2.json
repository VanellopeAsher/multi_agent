      "content": "To solve this problem, we have to add up the surface area of the two pieces of fabric Jim needs for the comforter and the fabric he needs for the duvet cover. \n\nThe respective lengths and widths of the pieces of fabric required for the comforter, as provided, are 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet and 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet. Hence, the area for each piece equals length x width = 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet. But Jim needs two such pieces, so the total area for the comforter is 2 x 80 square feet = 160 square feet. \n\nThe area of fabric for the duvet cover is also calculated as length x width = 9 feet x 11 feet = 99 square feet. \n\nAdding up all the areas, Jim needs 160 square feet (for the comforter) + 99 square feet (for the duvet cover) = 259 square feet of fabric in total."
