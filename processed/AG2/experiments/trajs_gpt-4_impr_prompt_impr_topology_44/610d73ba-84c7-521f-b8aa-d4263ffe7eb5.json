Determine the distance Reggie ran based on the problem statement. According to the statement, Reggie ran a distance five times that of Paisley's distance. This gives us a total of 5 * Paisley's distance.\n3. To find the distance Lynn ran is a bit more tricky. The statement gave us another clue: Reggie ran 3 miles more than what Lynn ran. Given the distance Reggie ran, we can determine Lynn's distance as the difference of Reggie's distance and 3 miles.\n4. Therefore, the distance that Lynn ran is given by (Reggie's distance - 3 miles)."

Given that we calculated Reggie's running distance as 5 times the distance Paisley ran (i.e., 4 miles) equaling 20 miles, subtracting 3 miles gives us Lynn's running distance of 17 miles.
