This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

      "content": "I'll approach this problem by working out the time John spent on each activity, then find the total time spent.\n\n1. Boating time: 6 hours\n2. Swimming time: half the boating time, so it's 6/2 = 3 hours\n3. Shows time: 3 shows of 2 hours each, so it's 3 * 2 = 6 hours\n4. The total time spent thus far is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours\n5. Based on the problem, this 15 hours is 30% of the total time. Therefore, to find the total time, you would calculate 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours\n6. Sightseeing time is said to be 40% of the total time. So, to find out the sightseeing time, you calculate 40% of 50 hours i.e. 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours\n\nAs such, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
