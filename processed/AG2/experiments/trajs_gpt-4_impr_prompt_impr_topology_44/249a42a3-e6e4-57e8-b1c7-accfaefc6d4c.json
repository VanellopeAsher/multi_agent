Calculate the number of days Billy works. Subtract 20% of the total days from the total number of days.\n3. Determine the total hours Billy works by multiplying the number of days by 3.5 hours each day.\n4. Calculate how many people Billy can assist. Given he can help 2 people per hour, multiply the total number of hours he works by 2. This will give us the total number of people he helps."

Calculate the number of days Billy works by subtracting 20% of the total days from the total number of days.\n3. Calculate total hours Billy works (number of days he works times 3.5 hours per day).\n4. Multiply the total hours Billy works by 2 (because he helps 2 people per hour) to find out how many people he helps during this period.\n\nLet's execute this plan via Python code:\n\n```python\n# total days from March 1st to April 19th\ntotal_days = 31 + 19\n\n# calculating how many days Billy works\nworking_days = total_days * (1 - 0.2)\n\n# calculating total hours Billy works\ntotal_hours = working_days * 3.5\n\n# calculating how many people Billy helps\npeople_helped = total_hours * 2\n\nprint(people_helped)\n```\nLet me execute this code."
