In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

The third Lego box has 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.\n4. The fourth Lego box has 125 more pieces than the 500 piece set, so it has 500 + 125 = 625 pieces.\n\nWe sum up all of these numbers to get the total number of pieces. \n\nThe total number of legos would then be:            \n                  500 (first box) + 1500 (second box) + 125 (third box) + 625 (fourth box)"
