On Wednesday, the water level decreases to two-thirds of what it was the previous day. \n\nTo solve this, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Tuesday's water level by adding the additional water (7 feet) to the original depth (17 feet). \n2. For Wednesday's depth, multiply Tuesday's depth by two-thirds. \n\nUsing this formula,\n\nDepth_Tuesday = Depth_Monday + Additional_Depth\n\nDepth_Wednesday = 2/3 * Depth_Tuesday\n\nWe can substitute the given values and calculate the depth on Wednesday. \n\nLet's solve it."
