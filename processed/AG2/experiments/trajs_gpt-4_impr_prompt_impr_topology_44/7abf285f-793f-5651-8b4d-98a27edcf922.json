Begin by adding the monthly bare minimum payments for all debts: student loans is $300, credit card is $200, and mortgage is $500. This totals $1000. \n\n2. Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts. To find this, we multiply the total minimum payment of $1000 by 50%, which is 0.50, then add the result to the initial total minimum payment. \n\n3. After that, we figure out how much Jessica pays per month by adding her Netflix subscription to her total monthly debt payment from step 2. \n\n4. Last, we calculate the annual payment by multiplying the monthly total from step 3 by 12 (as there are 12 months in a year). \n\nThis will give us Jessica's total annual debt payment. \n\nLet's implement this now.
