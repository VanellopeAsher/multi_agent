T + T + 2T = 500\nStep 2: Simplify the left-hand side of the equation to get 4T = 500.\nStep 3: Solve for T to get the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday.\nStep 4: The solution of T will be the number of chimichangas made by the Burrito Shop on Tuesday. \nLet's solve it."

Create a variable, T, to represent the unknown number of units made on Tuesday.\n2. Given that the same amount of units are made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice as many units are made on Friday, the sum of units made over the three days is represented by the equation 4*T = 500.\n3. Isolate T in the equation to find the number of units made on Tuesday.\n\nLet's proceed to execute the Python code for this. \n\n```python\n# Total chimichangas made across Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday\ntotal_chimichangas = 500\n\n# Coefficient coming from the equation T + T + 2*T = 500\ncoefficient = 4\n\n# Number of chimichangas made on Tuesday\ntuesday_chimichangas = total_chimichangas / coefficient\n\nprint(tuesday_chimichangas)\n```"
