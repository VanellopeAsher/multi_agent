      "content": "Steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total price without any discounts. The total price is the quantity purchased multiplied by the price per itemâ€”in this case, 10 gallons of gas purchased multiplied by $3.00 per gallon. \n\n2. Apply the cashback. The cashback is .20 per gallon, and 10 gallons were bought, so multiply .20 by 10 to find the total cashback.\n\n3. Subtract the cashback from the total price to find the new total. \n\n4. Apply the coupon. The coupon is a 10% discount, and you find 10% by multiplying by 0.10. \n\n5. Subtract the coupon discount from the total after cashback to find the final price. \n\nLet's proceed to execute these steps."

      "content": "The final cost after both cash back and coupon discount is $25.20. We calculated this by first finding the initial cost of gas before any discounts ($3.00 per gallon*10 gallons=$30.00), then subtracted the total cashback ($0.20 per gallon*10 gallons=$2.00), we got $28.00. Then we applied the coupon discount to the $28.00 (10% of $28.00=$2.80), and subtracted that from the cost after discount, resulting in the final cost of $25.20. I hope this helped!

By defining the variables and calculating the total cost, cash back, the cost after cash back, the coupon discount amount, and the final cost, the agent arrived at a solution of $25.2, which aligns with the original problem statement.\n\n2. **Agent Problem Solver:** The agent provided a clear breakdown of the process for calculating the final cost of gas after applying both cashback and the coupon. It followed the steps of calculating the total cost before any discounts, applying cash back, calculating the cost after cash back, applying the coupon discount and calculating the final cost, which all aligns with the original problem statement.\n\nTherefore, after reviewing both agents' proposed solutions, I am confident that the final solution is correct. The person will pay $25.2 for the gas after applying both the cashback and coupon. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{25.2}**."
