Cost of the parts used.\n\nGiven:\n- Service fee = $40\n- Labor charge per hour = $35\n- Hours worked = 2.25 hours\n- Cost of parts = $60\n\nSince the labor charge is made for each hour or fraction of an hour, we need to round up the number of hours worked. Given 2.25 hours of work, we have 3 hours to be billed, as labor is charged in full hours.\n\nSolution steps:\n1. Calculate the total labor cost. For 3 hours, the labor cost = labor charge per hour * number of hours billed = $35 * 3.\n2. Calculate the total service fee. As given, the service fee = $40.\n3. Calculate the cost of the parts used. As given, that cost = $60.\n4. Add up the labor cost, service fee, and the cost of parts to get the total amount billed by Patty. \n\nLet's calculate this now."

This is calculated by adding the service fee ($40), parts cost ($60), and labor cost ($105 for 3 hours). The labor cost is based on 3 hours because Patty charges for each hour or fraction of an hour, so 2.25 hours is rounded up to 3 hours."

The Python code correctly computes the total bill as $205, considering all costs: service fee of $40, the cost of parts of $60, and labor costs for 3 hours billing time (2.25 hours rounded up) at $35 per hour, totalling $105.

With a 2.25-hour job duration, the labour costs round up to be $35 * 3 = $105 due to the billing policy covering each hour or fraction of an hour. The cost of parts is $60. Therefore, the calculated total is $40 (service fee) + $105 (labour cost) + $60 (parts) = $205.\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{205}."
