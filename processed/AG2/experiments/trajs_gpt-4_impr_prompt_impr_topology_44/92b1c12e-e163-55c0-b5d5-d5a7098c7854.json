Set up equations based on the information provided: \n\n     Let's denote:\n       c  = Carver's age\n       d  = Daughter's age\n       s  = Son's age\n\n     From the problem, we know that:\n\n       c = 45 (Carver just turned 45 years old)\n       c = 2d - 5 (Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter)\n       d = 3s + 4 (The daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son)\n\n2. Solve the equations:\n\n     We have c = 2d - 5 and c = 45, which means 2d - 5 = 45. Solving for d (daughter's age) gives d = 25.\n\n     Now we can use d in the third equation: d = 3s + 4, which now is 25 = 3s + 4. Solving for s (son's age) gives s = 7. \n\n Therefore, Carver's son is 7 years old. \n\nWe can discuss this result further if necessary."
