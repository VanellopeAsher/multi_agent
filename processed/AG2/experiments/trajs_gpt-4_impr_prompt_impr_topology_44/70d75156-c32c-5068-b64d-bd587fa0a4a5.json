      "content": "To find the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, this problem needs to be solved in several steps:\n1. Calculate how many boxes she gave to her mom and sister. Since she gave 2 boxes each to her mom and sister, this means she gave away 2*2 = 4 boxes. \n2. Assuming she started with X boxes, this means she was left with X - 4 boxes.\n3. She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which means she sold 3/4 of them. So the number of oranges she sold is 3/4 * (X - 4) * 20.\n4. But we know that the number of oranges sold needs to be a whole number, so (X - 4) has to be divisible by 4.\n5. Given this information, we need to find the value of X that satisfies the conditions mentioned above.\nPlease note: this is not a complete solution because we don't know the total number of boxes that Mrs. Harrington bought (i.e., the value of X). With the given data, many possible scenarios could exist. If we are given the total number of boxes bought, then we will have a full solution. For now, the solution will be in terms of X."

      "content": "The solution of Agent Problem Solver is correct but incomplete because we are missing the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought initially. Using Python and the SymPy package, let's write a piece of code that calculates the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold. \n\nSince the initial number of boxes is not given, we will keep it as X. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\nX = symbols('X')  # Number of boxes initially bought\n\n# Number of boxes she gave to her mom and sister\ngift_boxes = 2 + 2\n\n# Number of boxes left with Ms. Harrington\nleft_boxes = X - gift_boxes \n\n# Number of oranges sold by Ms. Harrington\nsold_oranges = 3/4 * left_boxes * 20\n\nprint(sold_oranges)\n```\n\nSo the number of oranges she sold is represented by `15*X - 60`.\n\nAlthough the expression gives us the number of oranges sold in terms of X, we still don't know the exact number of oranges she sold without knowing the initial number of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought (X). We can say that for each box Mrs. Harrington bought initially, she sold 15 times the amount of oranges in a box minus 60. \n\nThe solution to the problem as stated is `15X - 60`, where X is the number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought. Mrs. Harrington sold `15X - 60` oranges.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

      "content": "Mrs. Harrington sold `15X - 60` oranges, where X represents the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought at the market. So, for each box she bought initially, she sold 15 times the amount of oranges in a box, subtracting 60 oranges.\n\nHowever, we must clarify that without knowing the initial number of boxes (X) that Mrs. Harrington bought, we can't determine the exact number of oranges she sold.\n\nThis discussion provides the most comprehensive answer to the given problem, considering the missing information. As a solution, we have provided an equation that allows us to calculate the number of oranges sold for any given initial number of boxes.\n\nDo bear in mind that it would be impossible for Mrs. Harrington to sell a negative amount of oranges in the case where X is less than 4. For real-life interpretation, X should always be greater than or equal to 4."

      "content": "The solutions proposed by the other agents are valid given the information provided in the problem statement. As it stands, the problem does not provide the initial quantity of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought, hence we cannot provide an explicit answer but only a formula.\n\nThe formula derived by Agent Code Executor, `15X - 60` provides the number of oranges sold for any initial number of boxes X. For practicality, X should be greater than or equal to 4, as Mrs. Harrington should have at least 4 boxes: two for her mother, two for her sister, and some to keep for herself and sell.\n\nGiven these considerations, please note that the solution and its application in a real-world context depend on an unknown variable. The problem-solving process led to this formula, but the explicit numerical answer is undefined due to the missing information about X.\n\nTherefore:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
