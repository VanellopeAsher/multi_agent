This is twice the initial amount of 4000 gallons which gives 2*4000 = 8000 gallons.\n\n2. Determine the total amount of water that is passing through the river on the third day which is 14000 gallons.\n\n3. To find out the increased amount on the third day, subtract the amount of water passing through on the second day from the total amount on the third day. This is done as follows: 14000 - 8000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the amount of water that increased on the third day was 6000 gallons.\n"
