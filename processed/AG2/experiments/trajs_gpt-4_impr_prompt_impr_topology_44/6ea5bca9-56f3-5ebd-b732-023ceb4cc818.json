In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Becca has 0.12 hundred more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3X + 0.12.\n4. We know that the total number of cards is 3.41 hundred. So, PJ's cards (X) + Smendrick's cards (3X) + Becca's cards (3X + 0.12) should be equal to 3.41 hundred.\nSo, we have the following equation: X + 3X + 3X + 0.12 = 3.41.\n\nLet's solve this equation to find the number of cards Becca has. To make it easier, we can multiply the whole equation by 100 so that we will find the answer in the number of cards rather than hundreds of cards. The equation will then be: 100X + 300X + 300X + 12 = 341."
