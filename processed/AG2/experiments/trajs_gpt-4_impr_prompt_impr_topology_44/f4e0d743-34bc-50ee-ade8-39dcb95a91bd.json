      "content": "Based on the information given, here's the breakdown of Madeline's yearly expenses on her dog:\n\n1. Food: It's given that food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, every month, she spends $25 * 4 = $100 on food. Since there are 12 months in a year, she spends $100 * 12 = $1200 per year on food.\n2. Treats: It's mentioned that treats cost $20 per month. Therefore, she spends $20 * 12 = $240 per year on treats.\n3. Medicine: Given that medicine costs $100 per month, she spends $100 * 12 = $1200 per year on medicine.\n4. Shampoo: The cost of shampoo is $15 per month. Thus, she spends $15 * 12 = $180 per year on shampoo.\n5. Toy: A toy costs $10 every two months. So, over 12 months, she will buy the toy 12/2 = 6 times. Therefore, she spends $10 * 6 = $60 per year on toys.\n\nAdding all these expenses, Madeline spends $1200 (food) + $240 (treats) + $1200 (medicine) + $180 (shampoo) + $60 (toys) = $2880 per year on her dog."

      "content": "To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate each item's annual cost and sum them up as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the weekly cost of food for a year: As there are 4 weeks in a month, and 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks in a year will be 4*12 = 48 weeks. As food costs $25 per week, the total cost of food for a year will be 48 * $25.\n\n2. The yearly cost for treats ($20 per month): we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year, so the total will be $20 * 12.\n\n3. The yearly cost of medicine ($100 per month): we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year, so the total will be $100 * 12.\n\n4. The calculation for the yearly cost of shampoo ($15 per month) is similar to the previous steps, so we have to multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the total cost for a year, so we will have $15 * 12.\n\n5. Finally, for the toys, we need to consider that a toy is bought every two months. Since there are 12 months in a year, the number of toys bought in a year will be 12/2 = 6 toys. As each toy costs $10, the total cost for toys for a year will be 6 * $10.\n\nWe sum up these costs to get the total annual spendings.\n\nLet's solve this using Python."
