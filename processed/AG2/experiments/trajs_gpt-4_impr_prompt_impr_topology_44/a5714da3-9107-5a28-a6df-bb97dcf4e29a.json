In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

The cost for the rocks can be calculated by multiplying the price per bag ($2.50) by the number of bags (2).\n3. The cost for the coral pieces can be calculated by multiplying the price per piece ($2.00) by the number of pieces (3).\n4. The cost for the fish food is already known, which is $2.00.\n5. The cost for the fish is not provided in the problem, so we assume that it is not included in the total cost she spent.\n\nFinally, we add up all these costs to get the total amount that Scarlett spent."
