      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. We first determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone, which gives her the ability to throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.\n2. We have been told that Polly can throw the javelin a distance of 4000 ft, so holding the gemstone she should be able to throw it 4000 x 3 = 12000 ft.\n3. To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames, we subtract the dragon's flame range (10000 ft) from Polly's throwing range with the gemstone (12000 ft). \n\nSo, using these steps we calculate that Polly can stand 12000 - 10000 = 2000 ft outside of the dragon's flame range and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin if she is holding the gemstone. This means that even when Polly is outside the range of the dragon's flames she can still hit the dragon thanks to the power of the sapphire gemstone."

After holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther (4000 ft * 3), which results in a distance of 12000 ft. Subtracting the dragon's flame range (10000 ft) from this distance, we find that Polly can stand 2000 ft outside of the dragon's flame range and still hit the dragon, which matches the calculated result. \n\nHence, I conclude:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2000} ft**."
