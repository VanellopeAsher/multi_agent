We know that two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer at home. Therefore, the remaining students (1 - 2/3 = 1/3) do not have a desktop computer at home.\n2. We also know that the number of students without desktop computers is 30.\n3. So, we can set up the equation: (1/3) * total number of students = 30. \n\nBy solving this equation for the total number of students, we will find the answer."

      "content": "So, based on the Python code execution done by Agent_Code_Executor and Agent_Problem_Solver's explanation, we can say that there are 90 students in the grade level. The process was as follows:\n\nWe computed the total as the number of students who do not have a computer (30) divided by the fraction of students who do not have a computer (1/3). This returns 90.0. Because the number of students cannot be a fraction, we understand this to mean 90 students.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that there are 90 students at that grade level."

Hence, to find the total number of students, we divided the number of students without computers (30) by the fraction of students without computers (1/3) which gives us 90. \n\nTherefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 90."
