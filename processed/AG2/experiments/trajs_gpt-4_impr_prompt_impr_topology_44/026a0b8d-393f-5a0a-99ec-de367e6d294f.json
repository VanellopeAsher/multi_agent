She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

Subtract the total cost of celery seeds from the total amount spent, which would give us the amount spent on tomato seeds.\n3. Finally, find the number of packets of tomato seeds by dividing the amount spent on tomato seeds by the cost per packet of tomato seeds.\n\nLet's compute these steps."
