Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to consider that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs. This means:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. This is 2 (for the two twins) times 30 (the number of eggs each twin found), which is 60.\n\nStep 2: We know that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, so we subtract 10 from the total number of eggs, which gives the number of eggs found by the friends. \n\nHence, the formula to determine the number of eggs found by the friends is:\n\nNumber of eggs found by friends = Total number of eggs - Number of eggs found by Smith twins - Number of eggs that were not found\n\nWhen we have values for all the variables, we would substitute them in to get the solution."

This means the friends found the total number of eggs minus the ones found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found. Attached is the Python code solution to the problem:\n\n```python\n# defining the number of eggs each twin found\neggs_each_twin_found = 30\n\n# defining the number of twins\nnumber_of_twins = 2\n\n# calculating total eggs found by both twins\ntotal_eggs_twins_found = eggs_each_twin_found * number_of_twins\n\n# defining the number of eggs not found\neggs_not_found = 10\n\n# the total eggs hidden would be the eggs found by twins plus the eggs not found plus the eggs found by friends\n# therefore, the number of eggs found by friends would be total eggs hidden minus the ones found by twins and the ones not found\n# assuming eggs_found_by_friends is x, we form the equation:\n\n# total_eggs_twins_found + eggs_not_found + x = total_eggs_hidden\n# Solving above equation for x (eggs found by friends) we get:\n# x = total_eggs_hidden - (total_eggs_twins_found + eggs_not_found)\n\n# We don't know the total number of eggs hidden. The problem cannot be solved without knowing or being able to infer that piece of information.\n```\n\nThe question isn't providing enough information to solve the problem. The total number of eggs hidden is missing. Therefore, it's impossible to calculate the number of eggs the friends found."
