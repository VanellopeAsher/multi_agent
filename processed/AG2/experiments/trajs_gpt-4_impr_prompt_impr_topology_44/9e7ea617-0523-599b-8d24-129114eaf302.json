Determine the height of the second tree by adding 50 feet to the height of the shortest tree: 60 + 50 = 110 feet.\n3. Calculate the combined height of the two shorter trees: 60 + 110 = 170 feet.\n4. Figure out the height of the tallest tree by doubling the combined height of the two shorter trees: 2 * 170 = 340 feet.\n\nSo, the tallest tree is 340 feet high."

Then, we will define the height of the second tree, `second_tree`, which is the height of the shortest tree plus 50 feet.\n3. Next, we will calculate the combined height of the two trees, `combined_height`, by adding `second_tree` and `short_tree`.\n4. Finally, we will determine the height of the tallest tree, `tallest_tree`, by multiplying the `combined_height` by 2.\n\nLet's write the Python code and find the height of the tallest tree."
