In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Step 1: Count the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought\n\nMrs. Harrington bought a dozen boxes of oranges. Knowing that a dozen equals 12, she bought 12 boxes. If each box contains 20 oranges, then she purchased 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of oranges gifted out\n\nMrs. Harrington gifted her mother and sibling with two boxes each. Since each box has 20 oranges, this means that each family member received 2*20 = 40 oranges. In total, she gave out 40 oranges * 2 family members = 80 oranges.\n\nStep 3: Determine the remaining number of oranges after gifting\n\nSubtract the gifted oranges from the total amount that Mrs. Harrington bought. This equals 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges. \n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington retained\n\nA quarter of the remaining oranges were kept by Mrs. Harrington. This is calculated as a quarter of 160 oranges, which equals 0.25 * 160 = 40 oranges.\n\nStep 5: Determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold\n\nSubtract the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington retained from the number remaining after the gifts. This equals 160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges.\n\nSo Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."

      "content": "The code provided by Agent_Code_Executor returns a float number for the number of oranges sold, which is inappropriate as the number of oranges should be an integer. The correct implementation should use integer division `//` instead of float division `/`. \n\nWhen comparing the different solutions proposed by Agent_Problem_Solver and Agent_Code_Executor, there is consistency; both agents propose the same solution for the given problem. The simple math calculations behind the problem allow each step to be carefully evaluated and confirmed. \n\nAgent_Problem_Solver's solution is a five-step solution where each step correlates directly to the steps taken by Mrs. Harrington. It accurately deciphers the problem and the solution without going outside the provided variables. \n\nAgent_Code_Executor's proposed code correctly implements the solution into python code. The values used are correct because they are directly sourced from the problem, and as such, no issues are raised due to assumed values.\n\nAfter carefully evaluating the steps to their solutions, I conclude that there's consistency in the logic followed, and the final result proposed is valid for the problem. Based on the established processes and the solutions provided, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND : \\boxed{120}"
