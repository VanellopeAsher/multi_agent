Calculate the total cost for each type of expense: the spaying cost is $200; for vaccines, the cost is $20 x 3 (number of vaccines), but there's a 10% discount on this total; for the broken vases, the cost is $12 x 4 (number of vases).\n3. Subtract the discount from the vaccine cost: $60 x (10/100) = $6 discount, so the total for vaccines is $60 - $6 = $54.\n4. Add up all the expenses to get the total cost of the kitten so far: $200 (spaying) + $54 (vaccines after discount) + $48 (broken vases) = $302. \nSo, Leah has spent $302 on her new kitten so far."

This total is computed as follows:\n\n1. Spaying = $200\n2. Vaccines = $60 - $6 (10% discount) = $54\n3.

Assumptions of values for the total cost calculation were not made as the values for spaying cost, vaccine cost and discount, number of vaccines, vase cost, and the number of broken vases were provided. No conflict arose in proposing solutions.\n\nThe final solution is the total cost Leah has spent so far on her new kitten. Both solutions proposed that the total cost is $302, which was obtained by adding the spaying cost $200, the total cost for vaccines after a 10% discount $54, and the total cost for broken vases $48.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{302}"
