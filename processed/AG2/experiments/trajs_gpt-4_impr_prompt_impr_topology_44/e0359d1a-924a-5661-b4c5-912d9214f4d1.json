To find out how much candy each of them would have, we need to add all the candy they have and then divide it by 3 (the number of people).\n\nSo, we would add Robert's 3 pounds of candy, Cindy's 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron's 4 pounds of candy, giving us a total. We would then divide that total by 3 to get the amount each person would receive.\n\nLet's calculate this in Python."

They suggest adding up the total amount of candy Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have, which is 3 pounds, 5 pounds, and 4 pounds respectively. After totalling it, they divide it by 3 (number of people), getting the result of 4.0. This answer is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{4}** pounds of candy for each person. \n\nPlease note that rounding is not required in this case as the result is a whole number."
