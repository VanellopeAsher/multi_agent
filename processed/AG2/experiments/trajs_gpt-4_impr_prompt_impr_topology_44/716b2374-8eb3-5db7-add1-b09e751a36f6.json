He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

This would be the initial 3 clients plus the 5 potential ones. \n\n2. Compute the total weekly expense on bleach by multiplying the number of clients by the number of bottles of bleach required for each client and by the cost of each bottle of bleach. \n\n3. Subtract the expenses on bleach and the profit from the total income. This should give us the total weekly cost for cloths.\n\n4. Finally, divide the total weekly cost for cloths by the number of clients to determine the cost of each pack of cloths. \n\nThese steps should allow us to calculate the cost of each pack of cloths that Kim requires for his housekeeping business."

This is the product of the total number of clients, the number of bottles of each bleach required by each client and the cost of each bleach.  \nStep 3: Subtract the total bleach cost and the profit from the total income. This gives us the total spending on cloths.  \nStep 4: Finally, find the cost of each pack of cloths by dividing the total spending on cloths by the total number of clients. \n\nThis should give us the cost of each pack of cloths."
