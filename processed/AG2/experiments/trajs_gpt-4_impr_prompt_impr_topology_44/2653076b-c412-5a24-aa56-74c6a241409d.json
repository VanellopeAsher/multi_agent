Calculate the total cost for each type of item: \n   - The cost for croissants is 5 items * $3.50/item = $17.50.\n   - The cost for cinnamon rolls is 4 items * $2.50/item = $10.00.\n   - The cost for mini quiches is 3 items * $4.50/item = $13.50.\n   - The cost for muffins is 13 items * $1.50/item = $19.50.\n\n2. Sum the total cost for all items to get the subtotal before discount: $17.50 + $10.00 + $13.50 + $19.50 = $60.50.\n\n3. Apply the loyalty card discount to the subtotal: $60.50 * 10% = $6.05.\n\n4. Subtract the discount from the subtotal to get the final total: $60.50 - $6.05 = $54.45.\n\nSo, Marcus's total bill, after the loyalty card discount, is $54.45."

The Agent defined the costs for the various items ordered, calculated the subtotal, computed the discount, and finally derived the total amount after the discount. The code also produced the same result, $54.45.\n\nTherefore, I verify that the solution given by both agents is correct and consistent. After applying his loyalty card discount, Marcus' total bill would indeed be $54.45."
