Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each boy as B and the number of seashells brought by each girl as G. \n\nBased on the problem description, we know that B = 600. \n\nThe problem statement also says that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (B) plus four times as many seashells as the boys. In mathematical terms, this means G = B + 4 * B. \n\nTo find out the number of seashells each girl brought, we can substitute B = 600 into this equation:\n\nG = 600 + 4 * 600. \n\nSolving this equation will give us the number of seashells each girl brought."

I will define the number of shells brought by each boy (B) as 600 per the problem statement. \n2. Then, I will use this, B, to calculate the number of shells each girl (G) brought, which as per the problem statement is 600 + 4*600.\n3. Once I compute the value of G via this method, I will print the value.\n\n```python\n# Defines the variable B to represent the number of shells each boy brought\nB = 600\n# Defines the variable G to represent the number of shells each girl brought\n# The value of G equals the sum of B and 4 times B\nG = B + (4 * B)\n# Prints the calculated value of G\nprint(G)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

B represents the number of shells each boy brought and G represents the number of shells each girl brought. They both utilized the given information in the problem to conclude that B = 600 and that G = B + 4 * B.\n\nAfter substituting B = 600 into the equation for G, they come to the conclusion that G = 3000. \n\nTherefore, according to the problem statement, the number of seashells each girl brought is 3000.
