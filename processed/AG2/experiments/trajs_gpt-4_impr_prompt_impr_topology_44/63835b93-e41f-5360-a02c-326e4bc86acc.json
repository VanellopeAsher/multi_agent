      "content": "To solve this problem, you need to add up the cost of neutering, vaccines, and broken vases as this represents the total cost that Leah has to endure.\n\nHere are the detailed steps to calculate the total cost:\n\n1. The cost of neutering is $150.\n2. There are 2 vaccines each costs $30, so the cost for vaccines = 2 * 30 = $60.\n3. The kitten broke 3 vases each costs $15, so the cost for the broken vases = 3 * 15 = $45.\n\nAfter you have calculated each cost, add them together to get the total cost: Total cost = cost of neutering + cost for vaccines + cost for broken vases.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost."
