Using integer division by the price of a gumball gives us the exact number of gumballs Colby can afford.\n\nSo I learned that if the price of a gumball is 25 pennies, then with 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies, Colby can purchase 13 gumballs.\n\nThis task is a good reminder of the importance of accurately converting to a common denomination when working with different units of value. Here, converting all coin values to pennies made the calculation much easier. Ensuring to use integer division was crucial to get the correct number of gumballs that can be bought, since you can't purchase a fraction of a gumball. Great teamwork!"

Start by determining the miles per gallon (mpg) the aircraft gets, which is the distance it travels for each gallon of fuel consumed.\n2. To do so, we know that the aircraft burns 5 gallons for every 50 miles it travels. Therefore, the miles per gallon is 50 miles / 5 gallons = 10 miles/gallon.\n3. Once we know the miles per gallon, we can determine how many gallons are needed for the aircraft to travel 600 miles.\n4. To find this, we divide the total miles (600) by the miles per gallon (10), resulting in the total gallons of the tank. \n\nIn a Python-esque outline:\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters\nmiles_travelled = 50\nfuel_consumed = 5\n\n# Calculate miles per gallon\nmpg = miles_travelled / fuel_consumed\n\n# Define total distance to travel\ntotal_miles = 600\n\n# Calculate total gallons needed\ntotal_gallons = total_miles / mpg\n```\n\nThe total_gallons variable will hold the answer for how many gallons the aircraft's tank can hold."

A dilution reduces the concentration of a solute in solution by adding more solvent (in this case, saline with 0% salt). Therefore, we can solve this problem by setting up an equation that represents the conservation of mass. \n\nThe initial amount of salt is equal to the final amount of salt, so the volume of the initial solution * initial concentration = volume of the final solution * final concentration.\n\nWe know that the pharmacist starts with a 30 ml saline solution at 10% salt concentration. We are looking for the final volume of the solution once diluted to a 5% salt concentration.\n\n1. We can start by calculating the initial amount of salt: 30 ml * 10% = 3 ml.\n2. Next, we can form and solve our equation. We know the final concentration and the amount of salt, so we can solve for the final volume: 3 ml / 5% = 60 ml.\n3. Since we know that the final volume should be 60 ml and we originally had 30 ml, the pharmacist needs to add: 60 - 30 = 30 ml of pure saline.\n\nThis can be implemented in Python as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define initial volume and concentration\ninitial_solution_volume = 30\ninitial_salt_concentration = 10 / 100\n\n# Calculate initial amount of salt\ninitial_salt_amount = initial_solution_volume * initial_salt_concentration\n\n# Define final salt concentration\nfinal_salt_concentration = 5 / 100\n\n# Calculate final volume\nfinal_solution_volume = initial_salt_amount / final_salt_concentration\n\n# Calculate the volume of saline to add\nvolume_to_add = final_solution_volume - initial_solution_volume\n```\n\nThe volume_to_add variable will contain the answer for how much pure saline the pharmacist needs to add."
