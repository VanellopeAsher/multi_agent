From these total earnings, we should subtract the total amount he spent on groceries and other necessities.\n\nThe Python code implementation of this would be:\n\n```python\n# define the variables\ndaily_pay = 30\ndays_worked = 7\nbabysit_pay_hour = 0\nhours_per_day = 2\nexpenses = 100\n\n# calculate total earnings from the daycare\nearnings_daycare = daily_pay * days_worked\n\n# calculate total earnings from babysitting\nearnings_babysitting = babysit_pay_hour * hours_per_day * days_worked\n\n# calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = earnings_daycare + earnings_babysitting\n\n# calculate remaining amount after expenses\nremaining_amount = total_earnings - expenses\n\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nWhen we run this code, we should get $110 as the result."
