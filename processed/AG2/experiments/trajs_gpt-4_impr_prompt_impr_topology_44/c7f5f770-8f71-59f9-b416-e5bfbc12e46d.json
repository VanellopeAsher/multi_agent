In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Let's break down this problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. Griffin had 30 french fries.\n2. Kyle took 6 of them, so Griffin had 30-6 = 24 fries left.\n3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. That means Billy took 2*6 = 12 fries. So Griffin had 24-12 = 12 fries left.\n4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, we don't know how many she gave yet.\n5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. Kyle took 6, so Colby took 6-3 = 3 fries. After this, Griffin had 12-3 = 9 fries.\n6. In the end, Griffin had 33 fries.\n\nSo to find out how many fries Ginger gave to Griffin, we need to subtract the number of fries Griffin had before she gave him some from the number Griffin had in the end. So the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin is 33-9 = 24 fries."
