Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum and each cost $2, the total cost would be 2 packs * $2/pack = $4.\n\nStep 2: Find the cost of the apple gum. Suzie paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum. Given the grape gum cost $2, the green apple gum would have cost $2/2 = $1.\n\nStep 3: Finally, we can calculate the total amount Suzie paid by summing up the cost of all the different packs of gum she bought. Total cost = cost of strawberry gum + cost of grape gum + cost of green apple gum = $4 + $2 + $1 = $7. \n\nTherefore, Suzie paid $7 in all for the packs of gum."

Calculation of the total cost for the strawberry gum as $2 * 2 = $4.\n2. Determination of the grape and green apple gum costs as $2 and $2/2 = $1, respectively.\n3.
