This seems to fit with the initial problem description since if you subtract 3 years from both Seth and Brooke's present ages, it would mean Seth was 17 and Brooke was 8, and Seth indeed is more than twice as old as Brooke at that point. So, this answer is consistent with the initial problem statement. Now, I will check the code logic and the calculations.\n\nThe logic of the Python code seems to be solid. The sympy module was employed to represent the algebraic equations and perform the calculations, which is a good way to handle algebraic problems via Python.\n\nSo, the outputs of the Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor are consistent with the problem statement's solution. Both of them offered sound reasoning and have maintained a logical workflow. \n\nTo conclude and verify, the age of Seth is 20 years old. Both the manual solution and the Python code agreed on this result. Great work!"

In real life, such problems may not always be as straightforward but the basic principles of defining the problem accurately, translating it into a solvable equation or a set of equations, and then solving it efficiently are universal. \n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that different programming languages can handle algebraic equations differently, and Python's sympy module makes it very easy and practical in Python. In essence, it shows how mathematical problems can be automated via programming.\n\nAnd yes, Seth is indeed 20 years old."

Seth is twice as old as Brooke (Let's represent Brooke's age as B). This leads to our first equation, S = 2B.\n2. In 3 years, the sum of Seth and Brooke's ages would be 36. We can represent Seth's age in 3 years as (S+3), and Brooke's age in 3 years as (B+3). So, the second equation is S + B + 6 = 36.\n\nWe now have two equations that, with some simple algebra and substitution, should be able to help us find S (Seth's current age): \n\nS = 2B \nS + B + 6 = 36\n\nSolving this would give us the desired answer."
