      "content": "This problem involves fraction multiplication and subtraction. Here are the steps to solve it:\n\n1. **Calculate the quantity of water the girls received**: Each girl got 1/4 of the total 32 liters of water. So to find out how much water the two girls got in total, you multiply 1/4 (the fraction each girl received) by the total 32 liters of water, and then multiply the result by 2 (the number of girls). This gives you the total quantity of water the girls got.\n\n2. **Subtract the quantities of water the girls and the boy got from the total**: You deduct the total quantity of water the girls got and the 8 liters the boy got from the initial 32 liters of water. The result gives you the quantity of water remaining.\n\nWould you like me to calculate this for you?"
