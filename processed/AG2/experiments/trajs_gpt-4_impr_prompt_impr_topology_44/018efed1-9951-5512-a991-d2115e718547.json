In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Since he works 7 days a week, and earns $30 every day, to get how much he earns in a week you would multiply 30 by 7. \n\n2. Having found the total earning, the next step would be to find out how much Gerald spent. You can get this by subtracting the total amount saved from the total earnings in a week.\n\nLet's move on to the calculation:"
