Since DIY saves 20%, this means that the cost of making it is 80% of the cost of buying it. We can express this mathematically as:\n\nDIY_cost = 80% * bought_cost\n\nLet's plug in the given values and solve for the DIY_cost."

So, using the equation:\n\ntotal_cost = bought_price * 80%\n\nWe can substitute the given bought_price of $120 to find the total cost."
