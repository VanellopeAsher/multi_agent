Set up a relationship between Harry and Sam's shares of the fence: According to the problem statement, Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam. Thus, if we denote Sam's share as 's', then Harry's share will be 's + 80'.\n2. Express the total length of the fence as an equation: The total length of fence jointly owned by Sam and Harry is 200 feet. Therefore, adding Sam's and Harry's shares should equate to this total length. The equation expressing this relationship is 's + (s + 80) = 200'.\n3. Solve the equation: In order to find out Sam's share, we need to simplify and solve this equation."

You are designing a sequence of colored instructions and want to standardize the outcomes. \n\nWhen you spin the wheel to a color, then follow a colored path that leads to another color on the wheel. Due to different colored paths, a single color could lead to multiple colors. The problem is as follows:\n\nColors on the wheel: Blue, Yellow, Silver, Green, Orange\n\nThe colored paths and where they lead:\n\nBlue: Yellow, Silver\nYellow: Green\nSilver: Orange, Green\nGreen: Blue\nOrange: Silver, Yellow\n\nThe sequence of spins must start and end on the same color.\n\nYou need to standardise the outcome so that it always comes back to Orange in maximum three spins.\n\nVerify if it is possible considering the above colored paths, if yes then provide the sequences."

The color wheel shows that it's possible to spin from Orange to Silver or Yellow.\n2. For each spin from Orange, list all possible second spins:\n   For Orange -> Silver, the possible spins are Green and Orange.\n   For Orange -> Yellow, the possible spin is Green.\n3. For the second spin outcomes (Green or Silver), again list all possible third spins:\n   For Silver -> Green, the possible spin is Blue.\n   For Silver -> Orange, we have already reached back at Orange, no need to spin further.\n   For Yellow -> Green, the possible spin is Blue.\n4. Check if any of the third spins land on Orange:\n   For Green -> Blue, no more spins can be taken as we have exhausted the three-spin limit and are not at Orange.\n5. Once all viable pathways have been tried, compile a list of sequences that start and end at Orange.\n\nConsidering that we wish to come back to Orange in a maximum of three spins/turns, let's look at the possible way to achieve this on the color wheel, if any."
