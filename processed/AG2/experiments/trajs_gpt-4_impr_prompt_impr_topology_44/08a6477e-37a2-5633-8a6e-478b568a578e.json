      "content": "This is a simple subtraction problem. Here are the steps to solve it:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bandages at the start: The nurses' station started with 19 bandages and got an additional bundle of 50 bandages on the first day, so total bandages = 19 + 50 = 69 bandages\n\n2. Next, calculate how many bandages the station would have at the end of the second day if they didn't use any. The station got two bundles of 50 bandages on the third day, so total bandages = 69 + 2*50 = 169 bandages.\n\n3. Calculate the number of bandages used on the third day: Since the station used half a bundle (50/2 = 25) on the third day, the station have 169 - 25 = 144 bandages at the end of the third day.\n\n4. Since the station has 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, the station used 144 - 78 = 66 bandages on the first and second days.\n\n5. Given they used 10 fewer bandages on the second day than the first, if the number of bandages used on the first day is X, then X + (X -10) = 66.\n\nSolving that equation will give the number of bandages used on the first day."
