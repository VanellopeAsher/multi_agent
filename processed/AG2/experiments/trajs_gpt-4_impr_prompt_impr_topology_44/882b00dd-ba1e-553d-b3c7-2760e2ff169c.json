On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.

      "content": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Billy's starting hourly pay was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50, making his hourly pay $10.50. Then on his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00, making his current hourly pay $11.50.\n   \n2. Sally's starting hourly pay is $0.50 more than Billy's starting pay, which makes it $10.50. Then she got a raise of $0.50 after two months, making her current hourly pay $11.00.\n\n3. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours each, then Billy will earn $11.50 * 20 = $230 and Sally will earn $11.00 * 20 = $220.\n\n4. Therefore, Billy will earn $230 - $220 = $10 more than Sally. \n\nSo, Billy will earn $10 more than Sally for the same amount of hours worked."
