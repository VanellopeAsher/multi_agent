In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate the total miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday. This is 5.5 miles * 2 = 11 miles.\n3. Add the two totals to find the total miles Sam ran the whole week. This is 10.5 miles + 11 miles = 21.5 miles.\n\nSo, Sam ran a total of 21.5 miles during the week."
