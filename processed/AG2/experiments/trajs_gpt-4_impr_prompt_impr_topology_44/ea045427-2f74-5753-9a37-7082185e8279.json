Add the cost of the ballpen to the cost of the notebooks: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.00\n3. Calculate the total cost of the pencil case, which is twice the cost of one notebook and two ballpens: 2 * ($1.50 + 2*$0.5) = $4.00\n4. Add together the cost of the notebooks, ballpen, and pencil case to find the total cost: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00\n\nSo, William spent a total of $12.00."

      "content": "Based on the solutions provided by both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor, there is a conflict. The first solution Agent Problem Solver provided totaled $12, while the Python code executed calculation proposed by Agent Code Executor resulted in a total of $13. By carefully analyzing the problem, we can see where the discrepancy is.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The cost of 5 notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50\n- The cost of a ballpen: $0.50\n- The cost of a pencil case, which costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens: 2 * ($1.50 notebook + 2 * $0.50 ballpen) = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00\n\nAdding these up, we obtain the total cost: $7.50 notebooks + $0.50 ballpen + $5.00 pencil case = $13.00\n\nConclusion:\nThe solution provided by Agent Code Executor is correct. William spent a total of $13. So the final answer is **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{13}**. Note that although Agent Problem Solver's method was correct, they made a calculation error when determining the price of the pencil case."
