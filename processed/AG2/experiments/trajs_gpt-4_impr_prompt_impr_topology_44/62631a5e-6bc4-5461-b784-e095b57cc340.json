Since the third person gets 150 more corn chips than what the others got, that means this person will get 700+150 = 850 corn chips.\n3. We can find the total number of corn chips by adding what each person got, which equals 1400+850.\n\nLet me now add up the amounts to find the total number of corn chips."

They suggest that if Amora and Lainey get 700 corn chips each, the total for them will be 2*700 = 1400 corn chips. Collins gets 150 more than the others, which is 700+150 = 850. The total amount of corn chips can be calculated by adding these amounts: 1400 (Amora and Lainey) + 850 (Collins) to get 2250 corn chips. This process is logical and accurate, and there are no assumed variables or missing information in the original problem statement. Therefore, the answer to the question \"How many corn chips were there altogether?\" is 2250.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{2250}**"
