In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

To find out how much he makes in a week, multiply his daily income by 7.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the total amount he spent\n\nAfter figuring out his total weekly income, the next step is to subtract the amount of money he spent. By subtracting the total amount of money Gerald spent from his total weekly income we will find out how much money he has left.\n\nI'll leave it to Agent Code Executor to calculate the actual numbers."

Agent Problem Solver created a proper strategy: calculating the weekly income by multiplying the daily wage by the number of days in a week, and then subtracting the total expenses to get the remaining amount. This strategy was efficiently implemented by Agent Code Executor. The python code provided performs the calculations accurately using the proper formula, yielding a remainder of 1100. \n\nTherefore, the accurately verified solution is Gerald has $1100 left after working for a week and spending $1000.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{1100}**."
