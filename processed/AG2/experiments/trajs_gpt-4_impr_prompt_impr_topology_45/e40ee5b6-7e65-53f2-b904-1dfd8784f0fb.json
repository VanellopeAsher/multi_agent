      "content": "We can also solve this by implementing the above problem solving steps into a Python code as follows:\n\nFirst, we calculate the price of half-gallon jar. We know that the price of one-gallon jar is $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, we subtract $2 from $5 to get the price of half-gallon jar.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for one-gallon jars by multiplying the price of one-gallon jar($5) with the number of one-gallon jars(10).\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the total cost for half-gallon jars by multiplying the price of half-gallon jar with the number of half-gallon jars(16).\n\nFinally, we calculate the total sum of money expended by adding the total cost for one-gallon jars and half-gallon jars.\n\nLet's see this in action:\n\n```python\n# price of one gallon jar\nprice_one_gallon = 5 \n\n# calculate price of half gallon jar\nprice_half_gallon = price_one_gallon - 2 \n\n# quantity of one gallon jars\nquantity_one_gallon = 10 \n\n# quantity of half gallon jars\nquantity_half_gallon = 16 \n\n# calculating total cost for one gallon jars\ntotal_one_gallon = price_one_gallon * quantity_one_gallon \n\n# calculating total cost for half gallon jars\ntotal_half_gallon = price_half_gallon * quantity_half_gallon\n\n# calculating total sum of money spent\ntotal_spent = total_one_gallon + total_half_gallon\n\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

In the process, they determined the price of a half-gallon jar ($3) based on the problem statement. They then calculated the total cost of one-gallon jars (10 jars * $5/jar = $50) and half-gallon jars (16 jars * $3/jar = $48). The total expenditure is the sum of these two amounts ($50 + $48), which equals $98. \n\nBoth solutions align and are valid, hence no further discussion is required. Therefore, the final solution is: \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{98}**. \n\nCecelia expended a total of $98 on purchasing the jars. This is the final step needed to complete the task above."
