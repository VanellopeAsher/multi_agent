In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate the total number of crayons Kate received. She got 3 boxes and each box had 64 crayons. That's a total of 3*64.\n\n2. Next, calculate how many muffin crayons Kate can make. For this, divide the total number of crayons by 8 (since she melts 8 small pieces to make each muffin crayon).\n\n3. After this, calculate the price per muffin crayon. For this, divide the total money she made ($36) by the total number of muffin crayons she made.\n\nThese steps will give us the price per muffin crayon."

She got 3 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 64 crayons. Total crayons are 3 * 64.\n\n2. Kate used 8 small pieces of crayons to make a muffin crayon. So, we need to divide the total crayons by 8 to get the total number of muffin crayons.\n\n3. Then, we'll calculate the price per muffin crayon by dividing the total money Kate made ($36) by the total number of muffin crayons.\n\n```python\n# total number of boxes\ntotal_boxes = 3\n\n# number of crayons per box\ncrayons_per_box = 64\n\n# total crayons\ntotal_crayons = total_boxes * crayons_per_box\n\n# number of crayon pieces needed to make a muffin crayon\npieces_per_muffin = 8\n\n# total muffin crayons\ntotal_muffin_crayons = total_crayons / pieces_per_muffin\n\n# total money made\ntotal_money = 36\n\n# price per muffin crayon\nprice_per_muffin = total_money / total_muffin_crayons\n\nprint(price_per_muffin)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent_Code_Executor"

By first determining the total number of crayons (3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons), then the total number of muffin crayons (192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffin crayons), and finally the price per muffin crayon ($36 / 24 muffin crayons), we arrive at the solution. The final result is $1.5 per muffin crayon.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: $1.5"
