Given the monthly electricity cost of $100 and there are 5 people sharing this cost evenly, we divide the total monthly cost by the number of people. \n\nStep 2: Once we have the monthly contribution of each roommate, we can calculate their annual contribution by multiplying this monthly amount by 12 (the number of months in a year). \n\nLet's compute these steps."

And so, over a year (12 months), the annual contribution per person would be $20/month * 12 months = $240.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is that each of the roommates would have to contribute $240 annually towards the electricity bill.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{240}."
