      "content": "To solve this problem, I will go through the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. We know that she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than she did on Monday, and that she wrote 5 articles on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 additional articles on Tuesday, for a total of 7 articles on Tuesday.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total time Meredith spent writing on Monday and Tuesday. Since we know that each article takes her 4 hours to write, we can calculate the time she spent writing articles on these two days as (5 articles on Monday + 7 articles on Tuesday) * 4 hours/article = 48 hours.\n\nStep 3: Determine the time Meredith spent writing on Wednesday. We know that she spent a total of 104 hours writing over the three days, so she must have spent 104 total hours - 48 hours spent on Monday and Tuesday = 56 hours writing on Wednesday.\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday. Since each article takes 4 hours to write, Meredith must have written 56 hours / 4 hours/article = 14 articles on Wednesday.\n\nStep 5: Determine how many times as many articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday. This can be calculated as 14 articles on Wednesday / 7 articles on Tuesday = 2 times as many articles. \n\nThus Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday."

We'll calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.\n5. We'll find out how many times as many articles were written on Wednesday as on Tuesday.\n\nLet's initiate the Python execution of these steps:\n\n```python\n# Number of articles written on Monday\nmonday_articles = 5\n\n# Number of articles written on Tuesday\ntuesday_articles = monday_articles + (2/5 * monday_articles)\n\n# Total hours spent writing on Monday and Tuesday\nmonday_tuesday_hours = (monday_articles + tuesday_articles) * 4\n\n# Total hours spent writing in the three days\ntotal_hours = 104\n\n# Time spent writing articles on Wednesday is total hours subtracted by the Monday and Tuesday hours\nwednesday_hours = total_hours - monday_tuesday_hours\n\n# Number of articles written on Wednesday\nwednesday_articles = wednesday_hours / 4\n\n# How many times more articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday\ntimes_more_articles = wednesday_articles / tuesday_articles\n\n# Printing the final result\nprint(times_more_articles)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor.\n"

The Code Executor agent has run Python code that successfully reproduces this calculation and also outputs 2.\n\nBy leaning on the information provided in the problem statement (no variable values were assumed for this calculation), the proposed solution is valid and dependable. Both solutions are correct, and an agreement is found. Thus, the final solution is that Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND**: \\boxed{2}."
