      "content": "Here is how I would solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Let's denote Carver's son's age as x. According to the problem, Carver is 8 years less than twice the age of his son. In mathematical terms, Carver's age is expressed as 2x - 8.\n\nStep 2: We know that Carver just turned 60 years old. So we can equate 2x - 8 to 60.\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation 2x - 8 = 60 to find the value of x, which represents the son's age. The steps to solve the equation are:\n                i)   Add 8 on both sides of the equation. The equation then becomes 2x = 68.\n                ii)  Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x.\n\nStep 4: The obtained value of x from Step 3 is the age of Carver's son."

This will give us the age of Carver's son. I will use SymPy, a Python package for symbolic computation, to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the variable x. This represents the age of Carver's son.\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# define the equation according to the problem. Carver's age, 60, is equal to twice the age of his son minus 8 years.\nequation = Eq(2*x - 8, 60)\n\n# use sympy's 'solve' function to find the value for x.\nson_age = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# print the age of Carver's son.\nprint(son_age)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

      "content": "The solution proposed by Agent Problem Solver is to model the problem using mathematical equations and solve for the unknown, which is the age of Carver's son. Agent Problem Solver used the equation 2x - 8 = 60, where x is the son's age, and solved it step by step. The steps used to solve the equation are logically sound and are based on elementary algebra rules.\n\nAgent Code Executor then executed Python code that uses the SymPy library to solve the equation - which is a programming DoE equivalent of the mathematical DoE proposed by Agent Problem Solver. The execution was successful, resulting in an age of 34 for Carver's son.\n\nThe solutions proposed by both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor align with each other, and their methodology is sound. Hence, I can confirm that the final solution, i.e., the age of Carver's son, is 34.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{34}**.\n"
