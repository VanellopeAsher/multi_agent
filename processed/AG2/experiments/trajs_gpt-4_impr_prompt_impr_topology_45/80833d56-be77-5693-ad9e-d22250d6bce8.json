      "content": "To find John's speed we need to figure out how many hours he runs in a week and then divide the total miles by the total hours. \n\n1. Start by finding how long he runs for the non-first days. He runs half as much as the first day, which is 10 hours, so he runs 10/2 = 5 hours on the second and third day. \n\n2. Now that we have how long he runs each day, add all these hours together to find the total hours he runs in a week. So the total hours he runs is 10 (first day) + 5 (second day) + 5 (third day) = 20 hours. \n\n3. Now we can find his speed by taking the total miles he runs and dividing it by the total hours. His speed is therefore 100 miles / 20 hours = 5 miles per hour. \n\nSo, John runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour."

Here is how we can break it down:\n\n1. **Calculation of daily running time**: Both agents accurately computed the daily running times, with 10 hours for the first day and 5 hours each for the second and third days.\n2. **Total running hours per week**: The total of these daily running hours per week was summed up correctly as 20 hours.\n3. **Speed calculation**: Both agents then correctly applied the formula for speed calculation as distance/time, leading to the answer 5 miles/hour.\n\nGiven that all steps have been followed correctly, we can conclude with certainty that John's running speed is 5 miles per hour. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5}.**"
