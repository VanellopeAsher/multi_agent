The news website publishes 20 political and weather articles, and its sister company publishes 10 business news articles. Therefore, their combined average daily articles count is 20+10=30 articles.\n\nGiven that 2.8 multiples of 10 days pass in February, the total number of days in the month would be 2.8*10=28 days. \n\nGiven the average daily count and the number of days in the month, we can calculate the total number of articles published in February. This would be done by multiplying the total number of days by the average number of articles published daily.\n\nTherefore, the overall number of articles published by the two companies in February will be 30 articles/day*28 days= 840 articles."
