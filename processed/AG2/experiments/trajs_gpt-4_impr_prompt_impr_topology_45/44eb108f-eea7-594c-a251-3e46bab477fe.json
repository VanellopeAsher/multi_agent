To do that, we multiply the total length in feet by 12, as there are 12 inches in a foot.\n\nStep 2: After converting the length of the wire to inches, we find out the length of each piece by dividing the total length of the wire by the number of pieces.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to solve the problem."

This calculation was made by first converting the total 4 foot length of the wire to inches (4 feet = 48 inches) and then dividing this total length by the number of pieces (48 inches / 8 pieces = 6 inches/piece). Thus, the Python computation verifies the accuracy of the provided solution."
