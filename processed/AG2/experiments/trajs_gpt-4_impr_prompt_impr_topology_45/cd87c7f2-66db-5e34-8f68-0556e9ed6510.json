In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

In this case, the total is given by the number of packs times the number of balloons in each pack. \n\n2. After getting the total number of balloons filled, finding out how many were thrown is as simple as subtracting the balloons remaining from the total filled.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps."

The calculations correctly correspond to the problem requirements: Jolene and her friends threw 880 water balloons in their water balloon fight.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 880 balloons were thrown in their water balloon fight."
