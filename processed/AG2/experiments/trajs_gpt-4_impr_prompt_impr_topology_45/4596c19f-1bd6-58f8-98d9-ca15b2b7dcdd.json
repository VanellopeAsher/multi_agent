      "content": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate the cost of the ingredients per jar:\n   - 2 pounds of passion fruit costs: 2 * $6 = $12.\n   - 1.5 pounds of jackfruit costs: 1.5 * $8 = $12.\n   - 2 pounds of special honey costs: 2 * $10 = $20.\n   \n   So the total cost per jar is: $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44\n\n2. Now, calculate the profit per jar by subtracting the cost per jar from the selling price:\n   - Profit per jar = $50 (selling price) - $44 (cost price) = $6\n\n3. The profit from selling 10 jars will then be: 10 * $6 = $60.\n\nSo, Tim earns $60 profit from selling 10 jars of this blend."

      "content": "From the problem, we can see that we need to calculate the profit for selling 10 jars of the blend. Consequently, to obtain the total profit, we can subtract the total cost of the ingredients for 10 jars from the total revenue from selling the 10 jars.\n\nLet's start by calculating the cost of ingredients for one jar:\n- Cost of passion fruit = weight of passion fruit for one jar * cost per pound of passion fruit,\n- Cost of jackfruit = weight of jackfruit for one jar * cost per pound of jackfruit,\n- Cost of special honey = weight of honey for one jar * cost per pound of honey.\n\nThen, we sum these costs to calculate the total cost for one jar.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars by multiplying the cost for one jar with 10.\n\nSubsequently, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars by multiplying the selling price per jar with 10.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit from selling 10 jars.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step."
