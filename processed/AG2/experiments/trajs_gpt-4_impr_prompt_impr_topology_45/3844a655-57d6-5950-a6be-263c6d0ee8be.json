The second venue costs 250 dollars per person.\n\nStep 2: Set the two equations for the cost as equal to solve for the number of guests at which both venues would cost the same. \n\nLet's denote the number of guests as X then we have:\n\n2000 + 50X = 250X\n\nThese equations represent the cost for both venue options and we want to find when are they equal, the point where they would cost the same.\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation for X. \nSubtract 50X from both sides of  the equation to isolate \"X\" terms on one side and then divide by 200 on both sides to get X alone.\nSolving will give the number of guests for which both venues are equal in cost. \n\nI'll let Agent_Code_Executor handle that part.

It then uses SymPy's solve() function to solve the equation, and prints out the value of X in a format that reflects the real-world context of the problem. \n\nFinally, we should run the code to get the number of guests that makes both venue costs equal. \n\nSuggested next speaker is: Agent Code Executor."

The equation set for equal cost was also set up accurately.\n\nAgent Code Executor accurately implemented python code to solve the equation provided by the Problem Solver. The code executed successfully and provided a numerical solution of 10. \n\nFrom the given problem, it is understood that there are no fractional guests, meaning the guest count should be a whole number. Since the value obtained is an integer, the solution is valid. Thus, Mark would need to invite 10 guests in order for both venues to cost the same.\n\nFinal Solution is: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10}**"
