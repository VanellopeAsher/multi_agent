Afterward, this needs to be subtracted from the total area of the quilt to figure out the left over area that needs to be filled with small shirts.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Determine the total area of Medium shirts: With each medium shirt being 4 square feet and 8 shirts used, the total area covered by medium shirts = 4 * 8 = 32 square feet.\n2. Compute the total area of Large shirts: Each large shirt being 6 square feet and 6 shirts used, total area = 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.\n3. Add the total areas of Medium and Large shirts: 32 + 36 = 68 square feet.\n4. Subtract this total area from the total area of the quilt to find the area that will be covered by Small shirts: 101 - 68 = 33 square feet.\n5. Since each small shirt covers an area of 3 square feet, the number of small shirts used = 33 / 3 = 11 shirts. \n\nSo, Octavia used 11 small shirts to make the quilt."

Calculate the total area covered by the 6 large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet\n3. Add these two amounts together to find the total area already covered: 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 68 square feet\n4. Subtract this amount from the total area of the quilt to get the area that needs to be covered by the small shirts: 101 square feet - 68 square feet = 33 square feet\n5. Finally, divide this area by the size of a small shirt to find out how many are needed: 33 square feet / 3 square feet/shirt = 11 shirts\n\nSo, Octavia used 11 small shirts to make the quilt."
