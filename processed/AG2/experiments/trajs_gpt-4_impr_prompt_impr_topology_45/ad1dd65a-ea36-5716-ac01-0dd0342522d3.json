In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here is my step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the phones: 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500\n2. Add the cost of the tablet and the headphones: $3500 + $330 + $137 = $3967\n3. Subtract the total cost of the items from the amount the electronics seller received: $4000 - $3967 = $33\n\nSo, the seller will give back $33 in change."

Both used the prices and quantities provided in the problem without making any assumptions, ensuring an accurate solution. The arithmetic was correctly executed, with the total cost of the phones, tablet, and headphones subtracted from the total amount given to find the change.\n\nThe consistent results from both agents confirm the accuracy of the solution. Both the explanation from Agent_Problem_Solver and the Python code from Agent_Code_Executor have been verified and align with the findings, so we can be confident in the final solution."
