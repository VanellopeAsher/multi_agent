Calculate the total amount Terry makes from selling the milkshakes: \n    To do this, we multiply the number of milkshakes sold (6) by the price per milkshake ($5.50).\n2. Calculate the total amount Terry makes from selling the burger platters:\n    To do this, we multiply the number of burger platters sold (9) by the price per burger platter ($11.5).\n3. Calculate the number of sodas Terry sells: \n    To do this, we take half of the total number of sodas (40 / 2 = 20).\n4. Calculate the total amount Terry makes from selling the sodas: \n    To do this, we multiply the number of sodas sold (20) by the price per soda ($1.50).  \n5. Add up the total amounts Terry makes from the milkshakes, the burger platters, and the sodas to obtain the total amount of money Terry makes."
