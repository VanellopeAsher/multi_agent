This will give you the cost of each class.\n\n2. If the result from step 1 is more than $10, determine how many classes Manny can miss so that the cost per attended class doesn't exceed $10.\n   \n3. This can be done by dividing the total cost of the classes by $10 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. This will give the maximum number of karate classes Manny can attend without exceeding a $10 cost per class.\n\n4. The number of classes he can miss is then the total number of classes minus the maximum number of classes he can attend from step 3."

After that, we can calculate the number of classes Manny can miss to keep the cost per class below or equal to $10 which could be calculated by subtracting the result of dividing the total cost by $10 from the total number of classes.\n\n```python\n# The total cost of the classes\ntotal_cost = 60 \n\n# The total number of classes\ntotal_classes = 10 \n\n# Calculate the cost per class\ncost_per_class = total_cost / total_classes \n\n# Calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend to keep the class cost <= $10\nmax_classes_attendable = total_cost // 10 \n\n# Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss\nclasses_missable = total_classes - max_classes_attendable \n\n# print the results\nprint(\"Base cost per class: \" + str(cost_per_class))\nprint(\"Number of classes Manny can miss: \" + str(classes_missable)) \n```\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKERS: \n- Agent Code Executor\n- Agent Verifier\n- Agent Problem Solver"

Agent Problem Solver suggested a comprehensive approach to evaluate the cost per Karate class and then determine how many classes Manny can miss so that the average cost of attended classes doesn't exceed $10. \n\n2. Agent Code Executor executed the Python code based on the logic provided by Agent Problem Solver. The output showed that each class costs $6, so Manny can miss up to 4 classes to keep the cost of attended classes up to $10.\n\nAfter reviewing all the information, I agree with the solution. The number of Karate classes Manny can miss and still maintain a cost-per-class ratio that his parents are willing to pay is 4 classes. \n\nHence, \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{4}**."
