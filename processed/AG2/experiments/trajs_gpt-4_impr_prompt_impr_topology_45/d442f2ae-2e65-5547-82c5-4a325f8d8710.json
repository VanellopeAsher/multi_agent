      "content": "The total amount of money John spent at the market can be calculated with the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the goats by multiplying the number of goats by the cost of each goat. In this case, the calculation is 3 * $500 = $1500.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the cows by multiplying the number of cows by the cost of each cow. The calculation is 2 * $1500 = $3000.\n3. Since John decided against buying the horse, he did not spend any money on the horse, so the cost for the horse is $0.\n4. Finally, add up the total costs calculated in steps 1 and 2 to find the total amount of money John spent at the market. \nThe calculation is $1500 (total cost of goats) + $3000 (total cost of cows) = $4500.\n\nSo, the amount of money John spent at the market is $4500."
