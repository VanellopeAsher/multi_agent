We can put the value of P in equation (3) to find S, and then put the value of S in equation (2) to find B. \n\nThis will give us the number of cards Becca has. This final number will be in hundreds as the original problems specifies the total in hundreds. For the total number of cards, we'll simply multiply our result with 100."

We used the relation between the amount of cards that each person has, as well as the total amount, to find Becca's share. I concur with the result that Becca has 168.0 magic cards. This result was determined by forming and solving a system of linear equations based on the given relationships. It appears that we've arrived at the correct conclusion."
