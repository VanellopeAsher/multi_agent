So, 50% of $10,000 is $5000. Thus, Jessica will be paying $5000 extra each month.\n\nStep 3: Thus, the total monthly payment Jessica needs to make is:\n         $10,000 (Base Payment)\n       + $5,000 (Extra Payment)\n       = $15,000 (Total Monthly Payment)\n\nStep 4: Now, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year. There are 12 months, so multiply $15,000 by 12.\n\nSo, Jessica pays $15,000 * 12 in a year. Let's calculate that. "

      "content": "To summarize, Agent Problem Solver proposed the correct approach to solve this problem. It involves calculating the total of the minimum monthly payments, finding out what 50% more would amount to, and then adding that to the total minimum payment to get the total amount Jessica needs to pay each month. Multiplying that total by 12 gives us the amount she would pay in a year.\n\nAgent Code Executor implemented this approach in Python code and the result turned out to be $180,000 per year. \n\nAs per my verification, both agents' solutions are correct. So, Jessica would be paying $180,000 in a year if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts each month."
