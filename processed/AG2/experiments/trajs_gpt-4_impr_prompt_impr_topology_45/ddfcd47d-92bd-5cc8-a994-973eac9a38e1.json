This gives you Kassidy's amount.\n\nStep 2: Now, find how much money Rayna has. If Kassidy has a certain amount and Rayna has $70 more, you add $70 to Kassidy's amount. \n\nStep 3: Add together how much Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna have. This gives you the total amount of money.\n\nStep 4: Count the number of participants, which is three - Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna.\n\nStep 5: If they want to share the total amount equally, you would divide the total amount by the number of participants. This gives you the amount that each person would have after sharing equally.\n\nThis plan should permit to find out how much would each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them."

Calculate Kassidy's amount:\nThis can be done by multiplying Aurelia's amount (150 dollars) by 2/3.\n```python\nkassidy_amount = 150 * (2/3)\n```\n\n##### 2. Calculate Rayna's amount:\nThis can be found by adding 70 dollars to Kassidy's amount.\n```python\nrayna_amount = kassidy_amount + 70\n```\n\n##### 3. Calculate total amount:\nSimply add the amounts of Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna.\n```python\ntotal_amount = 150 + kassidy_amount + rayna_amount\n```\n\n##### 4. Calculate number of people (`num_people`):\nIn this case, num_people is 3, as we are dividing the total amount between Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna.\n\n##### 5. Calculate the equal share out of the total amount:\nThis equals to the total amount divided by the number of people.\n```python\nequal_share = total_amount / num_people\n```\n\nNow, let's put it all together in code."

So according to the given information and calculations:\n\n- Aurelia has $150.\n- Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia which is $100.\n- Rayna has $70 more dollars than Kassidy which is $170.\n\nTheir total is $420.
