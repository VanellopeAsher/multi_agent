Determine how much he spends each day: Since Peter wants to spend an equal amount each day, divide his total money ($70) by 7 days in a week.\n\n2. Identify how many action figures he can buy in the first half of the week: From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures, each at $5. To find out how many he can buy with his daily allowance, we divide his daily spending by the price of a wooden action figure.\n\n3. Compute the total number of wooden action figures: Multiply the number of action figures he can buy per day by 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday). \n\n4. Identify how many action figures he can buy in the second half of the week: For the rest of the week (i.e., Thursday through Saturday), Peter buys plastic action figures, each at $2.5. To determine how many he can buy with his daily allowance, we divide his daily spending by the price of a plastic action figure.\n\n5. Calculate the total number of plastic action figures: Multiply the number of action figures he can buy per day by 3 days (Thursday through Saturday).\n\n6. Compute the total number of action figures he will have by week's end: Add up the total wooden action figures and plastic action figures. This would be the number of action figures Peter would have by the end of the week."

The result indicates that Peter will have a total of 20 action figures by the end of the week. This total comes from 4 days of buying wooden action figures and 3 days of buying plastic action figures, with his expenditure being equally distributed across all 7 days. Well done, team!\n\nHowever, in practical terms, it's important to note that the calculated daily quantity of action figures includes fractions, which are not realistic as you can't purchase a fraction of an action figure. But since the question doesn't entail dealing with only whole action figures, the solution remains valid in this context."

While the actual solution would involve only purchasing whole action figures, resulting in a different distribution and potentially a different total count of action figures, the question allows us to consider fractions of action figures.

This includes both the wooden action figures purchased from Sunday through Wednesday and the plastic action figures bought from Thursday to Saturday. Well done, team."

Based on the question, we have concluded that Peter will have 20 action figures by the end of the week.\n\nA key point in the discussion was the potential discrepancy between the mathematical solution and real-world application due to fractional results. In real life, Peter would not be able to buy fractions of an action figure. But for the purpose of this problem, the fractional values were justified.\n\nAll agents contributed equally and did an excellent job. Each agent's intervention was instrumental in the resolution of this task. I am looking forward to our next problem-solving session."
