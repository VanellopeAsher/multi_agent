So, there are 2000 / 2 = 1000 robots.\n    - The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. So, there are 2 * 2000 = 4000 footballs.\n\n2. Sum the quantities of each item to calculate the total number of items:\n    - 2000 (helmets) + 1000 (robots) + 4000 (footballs)  = 7000 items. \n\nSo, Dominick saw a total of 7000 items."

We can calculate the number of robots as half the number of helmets.\n3. We can calculate the number of footballs as twice the number of helmets (since it is given that there are half as many helmets as footballs).\n4. To find the total number of items, we sum the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.\n\nLet's calculate this."

The step-by-step solution provided by Agent_Problem_Solver and the Python code offered by Agent_Code_Executor both suggest that the total number of items Dominick saw is 7000. This comprises 2000 helmets, 1000 robots, and 4000 footballs. Therefore, we can confidently confirm that the total number of items Dominick saw is indeed 7000.\n\nI also appreciate the clear explanation provided by both agents.
