Substitute the second equation (Pa = J + 0.1 * 100) into the first equation to get the second equation in terms of P and J.\n2. Substitute the third equation (P = Pa + J) into the new equation from first step to get an equation in terms of J.\n3. Solve for J\n4.

However, we already have a relationship for Paul's age (Pa) from the problem statement, which is Pa = J + 0.1 * 100.\n\nTo find the actual numeric value of Peter's age, we need to substitute Paul's age (Pa = J + 0.1 * 100) into the dependent solution we got (P = 0.666666666666667*Pa + 30.0).\n\nThis will reduce our solution to just numerical values, thereby providing the solution we need.\n\nHence, the next step would be:\n\n4.
