To do this, we multiply the number of packets of celery seeds she bought (80) by the price per packet ($30).\n\nStep 2: Once we have the total spent on celery seeds, we subtract this amount from the total amount spent on all seeds ($3200). This will give us the total amount spent on tomato seeds.\n\nStep 3: Finally, to calculate the number of packets of tomato seeds purchased, we divide the total amount spent on tomato seeds by the price per packet of tomato seeds ($40).\n\nLet's discuss this approach with the other agents."

We subtract the cost of the celery seeds from the total cost to find out how much was spent on tomato seeds. Then, by dividing this amount by the price of a packet of tomato seeds, we can find out how many packets of tomato seeds were bought. Each step will be laid out separately in the code.\n\nLet's look at the commented code now."

The problem has been correctly solved as follows:\n\n- We determined the total spent on celery seeds by multiplying the number of packets (80) by the cost per packet ($30) to $2400.\n- We subtracted this amount from the total amount spent to $800, which is the amount spent on tomato seeds.\n- Finally, we divided this by the cost per packet of tomato seeds ($40), resulting in 20 packets.\n\nSo Mrs. Rylan purchased 20 packets of tomato seeds."
