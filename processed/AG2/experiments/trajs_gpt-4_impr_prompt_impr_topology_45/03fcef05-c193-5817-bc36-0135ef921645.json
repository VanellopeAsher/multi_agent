This includes $500 on a comic book and $1900 on a puzzle.\n\nLet's summarize this in a mathematical equation: \n\nMoney_Left = Initial_Money + Saved_Money - (Cost_of_Comic_Book + Cost_of_Puzzle)\n\nGiven:\n\nInitial_Money = $2100\n\nSaved_Money = $1100\n\nCost_of_Comic_Book = $500\n\nCost_of_Puzzle = $1900\n\nLet's replace the values in the equation:\n\nMoney_Left = $2100 + $1100 - ($500 + $1900)"
