      "content": "To solve this, we first need to establish how long both remoras together are. We're told each remora is 6 inches long, so two remoras will be 12 inches long. \n\nSecondly, we know that the combined length of the remoras is equal to 10% of the shark's body length. \n\nTo find the length of the shark, we can use the formula: \nRemora Length  = 10/100 * Shark Length.\n\nAnd rewrite the formula to solve for the shark's length as:\nShark Length = Remora Length / (10/100).\n\nSubstituting the remora length (12 inches), we get:\nShark Length = 12 inches / (10/100) = 120 inches.\n\nTherefore, the shark is 120 inches long."
