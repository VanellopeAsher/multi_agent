In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Sure, please allow me a moment to calculate this for you.\n\nStep 1: Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.\n\nStep 2: On the first stop, 8 passengers get off the bus, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.\n\nStep 3: Then, 5 * 8 = 40 new passengers get on the bus, increasing the total to 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.\n\nStep 4: However, 2 of these new passengers decide to get off before the bus departs. So, the total becomes 80 - 2 = 78.\n\nStep 5: On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 78 - 21 = 57 passengers on the bus.\n\nStep 6: Then, 3 times fewer passengers than those who got off get on the bus. So, the number of new passengers is 21 / 3 = 7 and the total becomes 57 + 7 = 64.\n\nSo, 64 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop. Please correct me if I made a mistake in my calculations. Thank you."
