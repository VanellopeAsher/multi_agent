  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

      "content": "Here is how to solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate the total number of clients Kim has by adding the current number of clients and the potential clients. \n\n2. Then calculate the total cost of bleach needed to clean all the homes by multiplying the total number of bottles by the cost per bottle.\n\n3. Use the formula: \n\n   Profit = Total Income - Total Expense \n\n   and rearrange to find:\n\n   Total Expense = Total Income - Profit \n\n4. Calculate the total cost of the cloths by subtracting the total cost of the bleach from the total expenses.\n\n5. Finally, find the cost per pack of cloths by dividing the total cost of cloths by the total number of clients, which will also equal the total number of packs used since each client's home requires one pack.\n\nLet's apply values to the steps:\n\n1. Total clients = Current clients (3) + Potential clients (5) = 8\n2. Total cost for bleach = Total number of bottles (2*8) multiplied by the cost per bottle ($2) = $32 (2 bottles per client).\n3. Total Expense = Total Income ($92) - Profit ($20) = $72\n4. Total cost for cloths = Total expenses ($72) - Total cost for bleach ($32) = $40\n5. Cost per pack of cloths = Total cost for cloths ($40) divided by the total number of clients (8) = $5\n\nSo each pack of cloths costs $5."
