Identify the time spent on the known activities. \n    - Boating = 60 hours\n    - Swimming = Half of boating = 60 / 2 = 30 hours\n    - Watching shows = 30 shows * 20 hours each = 600 hours        \n2. Calculate the total hours spent on the known activities.\n    - Total = Boating + Swimming + Watching shows = 60 hours + 30 hours + 600 hours = 690 hours\n  \n3. Given that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time spent \n    - Therefore, the total time spent = Time spent watching shows / 30% = 600 hours / 0.3 = 2000 hours\n  \n4. Given that 40% of the total time was spent sightseeing\n    - Therefore, the time spent sightseeing = Total time spent * 40% = 2000 hours * 0.4 = 800 hours\n\nBased on the above calculations, John spent 800 hours sightseeing."

      "content": "John spent 800 hours sightseeing. Here's the step-by-step solution to this problem:\n\n1. Total time John spent boating and swimming: 60 hours (boating) + 30 hours (swimming) = 90 hours\n2. Total time John spent watching shows: 30 shows * 20 hours/show = 600 hours.\n3. So, he spent a total of 90 + 600 = 690 hours boating, swimming, and watching shows. This was 70% of his total time (Because 30% of his time was spent watching shows only).\n4. Therefore, his total vacation time = 690 hours / 0.70 = 985.71 ≈ 986 hours. (considering up to 1 decimal point)\n5. It was given that, John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing will be 40% of his total vacation time. So, Time sightseeing = 0.40 * 986 hours = 394.29 ≈ 394 hours.\n\nTherefore, John spent approximately 394 hours sightseeing. It's important to note that this is an approximate figure as we're working with rounded figures. A more exact figure would need the original numbers, but this should give an idea about the time John spent.\n\nRemember that this is independent of other solutions provided by the agent team and might provide different results due to rounding or estimation."

They then calculated the total time spent on vacation. \n\nFinally, they used the percentage to calculate how much time was spent sightseeing. This is a good application of percentage calculations on real-life problems. Therefore, as per my verification, John spent 800 hours sightseeing. Great work, team!"
