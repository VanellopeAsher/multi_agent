      "content": "Here is my step by step solution:\n\n1. First, calculate the total number of basketball cards Maria has. She has 6 decks of 25 cards each, so 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards\n2. Then, calculate the total number of baseball cards Maria has. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards each, so 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards\n3. Now, add up these totals to find out how many cards in total Miss Maria has: 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards\n4. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards and gives the rest to her students. So subtract the 50 cards she kept from the total: 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards\n5. Each student gets 10 cards. So divide the total number of cards by the number of cards each student gets to find the number of students: 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students\n\nSo, Miss Maria has 30 students."

Calculate the remaining cards\nremaining_cards = total_cards - 50\n\n# Each student gets 10 cards, calculate the number of students\nnum_students = remaining_cards // 10\n\nprint(num_students)\n```\n\nOnce this python code is run, it will provide us with the number of students Miss Maria has.\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

This result was reached by calculating the total number of cards (i.e., adding Maria's basketball and baseball cards), then subtracting the cards Maria kept and finally dividing the remaining cards by the number each student received. This confirms that their solutions are indeed correct. Well done, team!"
