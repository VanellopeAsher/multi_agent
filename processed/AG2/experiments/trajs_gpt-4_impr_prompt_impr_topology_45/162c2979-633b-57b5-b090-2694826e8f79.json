      "content": "To solve this problem follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the strawberry gum: Suzie bought 2 packs and each costs  $2. Therefore, multiply 2 packs * $2/pack = $4.\n2. Determine the cost of the green apple gum: This cost half as much as a pack of grape gum, and we know the grape gum costs $2. So, 1 pack of green apple gum = $2 / 2 = $1.\n3. Sum the costs of the strawberry, grape, and apple packs: $4 (for strawberry) + $2 (for grape) + $1 (for apple) = $7.\n\nSo, Suzie paid a total of $7 for all the packs of gum."

As each pack of strawberry gum costs $2, and Suzie bought 2 packs, we will multiply these two numbers.\n2. Next, we will calculate the cost of the green apple gum. As it costs half of what the grape gum costs, we will divide the cost of the grape gum, which is $2, by 2.\n3. Finally, we will add the costs of all the three types of gum packs together - the cost of strawberry, grape, and green apple gum. \n\nThis will give us the total amount Suzie paid for all the packs of gum."
