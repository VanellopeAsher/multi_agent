      "content": "To solve this problem, we can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Determine the amount of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms: To do this, we first need to find how much protein is in one gram of mushrooms by dividing the amount of protein in 150 grams of mushrooms (which is 4 grams) by the weight of the mushrooms (150 grams). This will give us the grams of protein per one gram of mushrooms.\n2. Find the protein in 300 grams of mushrooms: We should then multiply the grams of protein per one gram of mushrooms by the number of grams John eats per day (300 grams).\n3. Find the total amount of protein John gets in a week: Since there are seven days in a week, we multiply the amount of protein John gets in a day by seven.\n\nAfter carrying out these calculations, we will be able to determine how many grams of protein John gets in a week if he eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day."
