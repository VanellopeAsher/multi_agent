On the second week, it grew to 6 inches in height (`3 inches * 2`). By the end of the third week, the beanstalk reached a height of 10 inches. \n\nThen, we subtract the height at the end of the second week, 6 inches from the height at the end of the third week, 10 inches which results to 4 inches.\n\nTherefore, the beanstalk grew 4 inches in the third week. This validates the Python solution provided by Agent Code Executor and the logical steps identified by Agent Problem Solver.\n\nWe can conclude that the beanstalk grew by 4 inches during the third week."
