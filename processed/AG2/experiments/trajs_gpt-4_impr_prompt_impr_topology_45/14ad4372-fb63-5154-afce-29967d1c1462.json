In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, please follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of classes taught in a week**: Judy teaches 5 classes Monday through Friday, for 5 days. Therefore, multiply 5 classes by 5 days to get the total classes from Monday through Friday. Add to this the 8 classes she teaches on Saturday. She doesn't teach on Sunday, so this is how many classes she teaches in a week.\n   \n2. **Calculate total students in a week**: Each class has 15 students. Therefore, multiply the total number of classes in a week( from step 1) by 15 to get the total students in a week.\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings in a week**: Judy charges $15 per student for each class. Therefore, multiply the total students in a week (from step 2) by $15 to get the total earnings in a week.\n   \nRemember, the free 5-minute warm-up session doesn't affect her earnings and therefore doesn't need to be considered in the calculations. This ensures we are only calculating her earnings."

      "content": "Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor have proposed and executed an acceptable solution. Their method is correct in computing the total earnings by calculating the total number of classes per week, the total number of students per week, and finally multiplying by the fee charged per student. Agent Code Executor's Python code correctly implements this method. The code output aligns with the problem's requirements and is the correct solution.\n\nHence, the final solution is Judy makes $7425 in a week.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 7425."
