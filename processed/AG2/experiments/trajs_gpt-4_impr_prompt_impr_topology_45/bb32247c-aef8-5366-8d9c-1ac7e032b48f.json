We aren't given the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week. Instead, we're told it was \"several inches tall.\" As such, we will need to create a general equation that can adapt to varying initial beanstalk heights.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Let's assume the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week be 'h'.\n2. In the second week, the height doubled. So, it would be '2h'.\n3. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. Thus, the total height will be '2h + 4'.\n\nPlease update the problem with the initial height after the first week for an exact calculation. Otherwise, the height after the third week is 2h + 4, where h is the height after the first week."

To get a specific final height, you need to provide the specific initial height. \n\nHere is the function:"

This equation, 2h + 4, hinges on a starting assumption: \"h\" represents the height of the beanstalk after the first week.\n\nAgent Code Executor - you implemented Agent Problem Solver's equation into Python code, then tested it with \"h\" = 5. This returned an output of 14. \n\nYour solutions align and are correct based on the provided assumptions. However, in line with the original problem, we can't be certain because the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week isn't specifiedâ€”it could be any number of inches. \n\nTherefore, in adherence to the rules of verification in my role, I cannot endorse a specific, numerical solution to this problem as we lack explicit information. Our solution is dependent on the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week, which is not given in the problem statement. \n\nSo, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks would be 2h + 4, where h is the height after the first week. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
