      "content": "Step-by-step calculation of Madeline's spending on her dog per year:\n\n1. Calculate the monthly food costs: 4 weeks/month * $25/week = $100/month\n2. Calculate the cost of toys per month: Since a toy is bought every two months, the monthly cost is $10/2 = $5/month\n3. Add all the monthly costs: $100/month (food) + $20/month (treats) + $100/month (medicine) + $15/month (shampoo) + $5/month (toy) = $240/month\n4. Calculate the annual cost: 12 months/year * $240/month = $2880/year\n\nSo, Madeline spends $2880 on her dog per year."
