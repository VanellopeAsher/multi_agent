The total volume of water on the third day is indeed 14000 gallons.\n\nVerifying this against the problem statement, it's noted that the agents followed the steps correctly. On the first day, the river's volume was 4000 gallons. The volume doubled to 8000 gallons following a day of heavy rainfall. On the third day, the volume was increased by another 6000 gallons to a total of 14000 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is correct.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{14000}"
