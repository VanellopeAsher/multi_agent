In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

According to the statement, he's buying:\n\n- 3.6 times of ten red tulips - it means he is buying 3.6 * 10 = 36 red tulips.\n- 2.4 times of ten blue tulips - it means he is buying 2.4 * 10 = 24 blue tulips.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many rows he will plant considering the fact that:\n\n- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, the number of rows for red tulips would be 36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips.\n- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, the number of rows for blue tulips would be 24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips.\n\nFinally, adding up both the rows would give us the total number of rows that Jackson will plant:\n\n- 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows. \n\nTherefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."
