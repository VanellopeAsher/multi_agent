So, to determine how many liters each girl got, we multiply 32 liters by 1/4. \n\nStep 2: There were two girls, so we multiply the result from Step 1 by 2. \n\nStep 3: We then subtract the total liters of water the two girls got (derived from Step 2) from 32 liters.\n\nStep 4: A boy got 8 liters of water. We further subtract this from the result of Step 3 to get how many liters of water were left."

The procedure followed by both of them is sound and leads to the correct answer that 8 liters of water were left. To summarize:\n\n1. Each of the two girls took 1/4 of the 32 liters of water, which results in (1/4) * 32 = 8 liters per girl or 16 liters in total.\n2. The boy then took 8 liters from the remainder.\n3. Subtracting the total amount taken by the girls and the boy from the initial 32 liters, leaves us with 32 - 16 - 8 = 8 liters."
