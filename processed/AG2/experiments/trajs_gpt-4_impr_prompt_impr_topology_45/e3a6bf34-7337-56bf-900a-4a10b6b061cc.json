      "content": "Step 1: \nCalculate how many yellow ties John purchases. Since each yellow tie is priced at $30 and he spent a total of $300 on yellow ties, you simply divide 300 by 30. The result is 10 yellow ties.\n\nStep 2: \nCalculate the price of the green ties. Given that green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties, which cost $30 each, 70% of 30 is 21. Therefore, the price of each green tie is 30 + 21, which is $51.\n\nStep 3:\nCalculate the amount John spends on green ties. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties and we’re assuming he maintains the same buying ratio for all his ties, we determine that he also buys 10 green ties like the yellow ones. This results in a total expenditure of 10*51, which is $510 on green ties.\n\nStep 4:\nAdd up the amount he spent on both yellow and green ties to find out his total expenditure on ties. That’s 300 + 510, which equals $810. \n\nPlease note:\nThis solution presumes that the comparison in quantity mentioned in the problem statement for red and blue ties applies to yellow and green ties as well. If there's any additional instruction to demonstrate otherwise, the answer might vary."

      "content": "Both Agent_Code_Executor and Agent_Problem_Solver proposed the same solution, and I see no discrepancies in their steps. Using the given information in the original problem statement, both Agents agreed that the number of ties John buys is the same for all colors (excluding red and blue, which were not considered in the end budget calculation in this problem). \n\nBoth agents calculated the number of yellow ties John bought (300 dollars spent / 30 dollars each = 10 ties). Accepting the assumption that the buying ratio is the same across tie colors, John also bought 10 green ties. The green ties are priced 70% higher than the yellow ones (30 dollars each + 70% of 30 dollars = 51 dollars). The total spend on green ties therefore came out to be 510 (51 dollars each x 10 ties = 510 dollars). John's total spend on ties is the sum of what he spent on yellow and green ties (300 dollars + 510 dollars = 810 dollars).\n\nAgent_Code_Executor also provided a python code to calculate this, which returned the correct result confirming their solution.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{810} \nThis solution implies John spent $810 on ties, considering only yellow and green ties, and presuming he bought the same number of ties in each color. The cost of red and blue ties remains unknown and therefore wasn't included in this calculation."
