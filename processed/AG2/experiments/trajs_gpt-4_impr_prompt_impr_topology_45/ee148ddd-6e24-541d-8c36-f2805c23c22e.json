This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

      "content": "Step 1: To solve this problem we will first have to determine how much time John spent overall (without rest breaks and lunch) and later calculate the 40% of that total time, which correspond to the time spent sightseeing.\n\nStep 2: We know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. So, he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming. Therefore, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.\n\nStep 3: He watched 3 shows which are 2 hours each, so he spent 3*2 = 6 hours watching shows.\n\nStep 4: The time he spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows represents 30% of his total time spent without breaks and lunch.\n\nStep 5: Using the information above, we can establish the following equation to find the total time spent. If we let T be John's total time spent (without rest breaks and lunch), we have:\n30/100*T = 9 hours (boating and swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours.\nSolving this equation for T gives us the total time spent.\n\nStep 6: Once we find T, we can calculate 40% of it which represents the time spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's proceed to solve the equation for T."
