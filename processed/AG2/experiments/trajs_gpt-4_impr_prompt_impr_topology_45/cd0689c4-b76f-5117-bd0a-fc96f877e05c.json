In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

That's a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 presents.\n\nShe has 144 inches of ribbon to allocate among all the presents. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can allocate for each present's bow, she would need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of presents.\n\nSo, the solution would be:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of presents, which we've already done (12 presents). \nStep 2: Divide the total length of the ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of presents (12 presents). This will give us the length in inches of ribbon that can be allocated to each present's bow. Let's call this value R. So, R = 144 inches / 12 presents.\n\nNow, we need to do the calculation for Step 2 to find the actual length."
