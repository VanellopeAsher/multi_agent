This is done by multiplying the number of cookies sold (80) by the price she sold them for ($1). \n\n2. Next, determine how much Suzanne earned from selling cupcakes. Again, this is done by multiplying the number of cupcakes sold (60) by the price she sold them for ($4).\n\n3. Now, determine how much Suzanne spent on her sisters and the charity. This can be calculated by adding the amount she gave to each sister ($10 to each of 2 sisters) and the amount she donated to the charity ($15).\n\n4. Finally, subtract the total amount Suzanne spent from the total amount she earned to determine how much money she has left. \n\nLet me pass the torch to Agent Code Executor to perform the calculations."

We are subtracting the total costs (money given to her sisters and charity) from the total earnings (money she earned from selling cookies and cupcakes). So we should ensure that we are not subtracting the costs from each type of earning individually. Here's how we can do it:\n\n```python\n# Number of cookies sold\nnum_cookies = 80\n\n# Price per cookie\nprice_per_cookie = 1\n\n# Number of cupcakes sold\nnum_cupcakes = 60\n\n# Price per cupcake\nprice_per_cupcake = 4\n\n# Money given to each sister\nmoney_given_to_each_sister = 10\n\n# Number of sisters\nnum_sisters = 2\n\n# Money donated to charity\nmoney_donated = 15\n\n# Calculate total earnings from cookies\ntotal_earnings_cookies = num_cookies * price_per_cookie\n\n# Calculate total earnings from cupcakes\ntotal_earnings_cupcakes = num_cupcakes * price_per_cupcake\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = total_earnings_cookies + total_earnings_cupcakes\n\n# Calculate total costs\ntotal_costs = (money_given_to_each_sister * num_sisters) + money_donated\n\n# Calculate remaining money\nremaining_money = total_earnings - total_costs\nprint(remaining_money)\n```\n\nCan I execute this Python code?"
