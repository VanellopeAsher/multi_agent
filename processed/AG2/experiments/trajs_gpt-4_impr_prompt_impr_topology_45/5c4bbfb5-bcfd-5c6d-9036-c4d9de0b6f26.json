      "content": "Here is the process to solve this problem:\n\n1. Find the price per packet of bacon by dividing the total price of the bacon by the number of packets. Kelly bought 5 packs for $10.5, so each packet cost $10.5/5 = $2.1.\n\n2. Determine the price per packet of chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a packet of bacon so each packet costs 2*$2.1 = $4.2.\n\n3. Calculate the total price for the chicken packets. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken packets is 6*$4.2 = $25.2.\n\n4. Calculate the total price for the strawberries. Kelly bought 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.5, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3*$4.5 = $13.5.\n\n5. Determine the price per pack of apples. Each pack of apples costs half as much as a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4.5/2 = $2.25.\n\n6. Calculate the total price for the apple packs. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7* $2.25 = $15.75.\n\n7. Add up the total expenditure. The total expenditure is $10.5 (bacon) + $25.2 (chicken) + $13.5 (strawberries) + $15.75 (apples) = $64.95.\n\n8. Calculate how much money Kelly has left. Subtract the total expenditure from the budget. Kelly has $65 - $64.95 = $0.05 left."

The cost per packet of chicken can be found by doubling the cost per packet of bacon. The total cost of chicken can be found by multiplying the cost per packet of chicken by the number of chicken packets.\n3. The total cost of strawberries can be found by multiplying the cost per packet by the number of packets.\n4. The cost per packet of apples can be found by halving the cost per packet of strawberries. The total cost of apples can be found by multiplying the cost per packet of apples by the number of apple packets.\n5. The total expenditure can be found by summing the costs of the bacon, chicken, strawberries and apples.\n6. The remaining amount can be found by subtracting the total expenditure from the budget.\n\nLet's go ahead and calculate it."

Agent Code Executor also provided a valid Python-based solution, confirming the correctness of the calculations. To recap, Kelly needed to purchase items within a $65 budget:\n\n1. The cost of bacon was determined to be $2.1 per pack, resulting in a total cost of $10.5.  \n2. This information was used to determine the cost of the chicken at $4.2 per pack (since each pack of chicken was twice the cost of a pack of bacon). This resulted in a total cost of $25.2 for the chicken.  \n3. The total cost of the strawberries was then found to be $13.5  \n4. Using the price of strawberries, they calculated the cost of apples to be $2.25 per pack (since each pack of apples was half the cost of a pack of strawberries) and found the total cost of apples to be $15.75.  \n5. Adding all these costs gave a total expenditure of $64.95.  \n6. Subtracting this from the available budget of $65 left Kelly with $0.05."
