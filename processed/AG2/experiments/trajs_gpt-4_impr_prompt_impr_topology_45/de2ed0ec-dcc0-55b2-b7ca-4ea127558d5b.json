Therefore, the third child is 72 - 3 = 69 inches tall.\n3. The second child is 5 inches taller than the third child. Therefore, the second child is 69 + 5 = 74 inches tall.\n4. The first child is 2 inches shorter than the second child. Therefore, the first child is 74 - 2 = 72 inches tall.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the height of the first child in feet rather than in inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert the height of the first child to feet:\n\n1. 72 inches รท 12 = 6 feet.\n\nThus, the first child is 6 feet tall."

However, looking at their methods, both agents seem to agree on the approach to solving this problem.

Finally, they're suggesting to convert the first child's height from inches to feet by dividing by 12.
