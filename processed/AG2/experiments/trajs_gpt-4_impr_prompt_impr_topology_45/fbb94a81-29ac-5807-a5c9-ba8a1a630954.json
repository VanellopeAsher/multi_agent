      "content": "First, let's break down the problem and create equations based on the information given:\n\nLet:\n- Peter's_age = P\n- Paul's_age = L\n- John's_age = J\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following clues:\n\n1. P + L + J = 100    (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years)\n2. L = J + 18           (Paul is 18 years older than John)\n3. P = L + J             (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)\n\nWhen we are trying to find the variable P (Peter's age), one of the strategies we can use is substitution:\n\nSubstitute equation 2 (L = J + 18) into equation 1 and equation 3 in place of L. So, we'll get:\n\n- J + 18 + J + J = 100  (Substituted into equation 1)\n- P = J + 18 + J          (Substituted into equation 3)\n\nThe first equation becomes:\n- 3J + 18 = 100\n- Solve for J and find that J = (100 - 18) / 3 = 27.3333 years (approximately. But since age is normally expressed in whole numbers, it would be valid to round this to 27 years)\n\nSubstitute J = 27 into equation 3 and we get:\n- P = 2 * J + 18 = 2 * 27 + 18 = 72 \n\nSo, the age of Peter is 72 years."
