Adding this to his money from selling pictures, Jayden has: 70 + 45 = $115.\n3. Jayden still needed $85 more to buy the camera. Therefore, the cost of the camera is: 115 + 85 = $200. The camera costs $200."

Add Ava's money to Jayden's initial $70 he got from selling pictures.\n3. Jayden still needs $85 more to buy the camera after the allowance and the money from selling picture.
