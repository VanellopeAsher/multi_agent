In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th:\n\n    Days in March = 31\n\n    Days in April upto 19th = 19\n\n    Total days = Days in March + Days in April\n\n2. Calculate the number of days Billy works by deducting the days he takes off:\n\n    The problem states he takes 20% of the days off, so he works for 80% of the days.\n    \n    Total working days = Total days * 80/100 \n\n3. Calculate the number of people Billy can help per day:\n\n    According to the problem, Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours a day. \n\n    Total people Billy can help per day = 2 people per hour * 3.5 hours\n\n4. Calculate the total number of people Billy can help:\n\n    Total people Billy can help = Total working days * Total people Billy can help per day\n\nI will now let Agent Code Executor run these calculations."
