In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Let's start by adding up the total cost of the items purchased, which equals the sum of the price of the collection of pots and the bag of garden soil, i.e., $19 + $26.\n\n2. Next, we subtract $7, the value of the discount voucher, from the sum obtained in step 1. \n\n3. The result will give us the total amount of money that your mother spent at the garden store. \n\nLet's perform these calculations now."

Here we first define values for the prices of the pots and the soil bag, and for the voucher. We then calculate the total price before discount by summing the price of the pots and the bag, and we calculate the final total spent by subtracting the voucher value from the total cost before discount. Consequently, executing this Python code will give us the total amount your mother spent at the garden store."

Their solutions align perfectly with each other.\n\nThe total cost of the garden pots and bag of soil is $19 + $26 = $45. After using a $7 discount voucher, the actual money spent was $45 - $7 = $38.\n\nBy using a Python script to calculate, we obtain the same result. Thus, we can safely conclude that the total amount spent by your mother at the gardening store was indeed $38. \n\nGreat teamwork, everyone!"
