      "content": "To solve this problem, we have to make two key assumptions: \n\n1. The original length of the ribbon is denoted as L (in any unit of length).\n2. Each cut is perfect, meaning non of the ribbon's length is lost during cutting.\n\nThe steps for finding out the length of each final cut are:\n\nStep 1: Cut ribbon into 4 equal parts. The length of each of these parts would be L/4. \n\nStep 2: Each of these 4 parts are further cut into 5 equal parts. The length of each of these final cuts would be (L/4)/5 = L/20.\n\nSo, each final cut will be L/20 of the original length."

      "content": "Sure, I can execute Python code for this.\n\nBut in this case, we don't know the initial length of the ribbon 'L'. However, it's clear from the problem that each final piece will be 1/20 of the original length. So, the length of each final piece will be L/20 where L is initial length of the ribbon.\n\nFor more detailed solution we need the value of 'L'. As of now, this problem can be solved mathematically without need of Python code.\n\nThe final length of each piece would be Total length/Total number of pieces. Here Total length of Ribbon = L and Total number of Pieces = 4 * 5 = 20. Therefore, Length of Each Piece = L/20."
