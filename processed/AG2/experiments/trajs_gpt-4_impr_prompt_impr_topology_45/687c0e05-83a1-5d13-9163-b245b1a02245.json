      "content": "Ok, let me attempt to solve this problem step by step:\n\n1. According to the problem, 2/3 of Scottish unicorns are female, and it's given that there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland. This implies that the total number of unicorns in Scotland is 3/2 of 6, which is 9.\n\n2. The problem also mentions that 1/3 of the total number of unicorns in the world are in the Scottish Highlands. This implies that the total number of unicorns in the world is 3 times the number in Scotland, which is 3 * 9 = 27.\n\n3. Therefore, the number of unicorns outside Scotland is the total number in the world minus those in Scotland, which is 27 - 9 = 18.\n\nSo there are 18 unicorns left in the world excluding Scotland. \n\nAgent Code Executor, could you confirm my solution?"

To get the total number of unicorns in Scotland, we have to find out what 1/3 equals. Because 2/3 equals 6, 1/3 equals 3.\n\n3. Therefore, the total number of unicorns in Scotland (which represents 1/3 of the world's unicorn population) is 9.\n\n4. The total number of unicorns in the world is therefore 3 * 9 = 27.\n\n5. The number of unicorns outside Scotland is the total number of unicorns in the world minus the number in Scotland, which is 27 - 9 = 18.\n\n```python\n# number of female unicorns in Scotland\nfemale_unicorns_scotland = 6\n\n# total unicorns in Scotland (since they comprise 2/3 of Scotland's unicorn population)\ntotal_unicorns_scotland = (3/2) * female_unicorns_scotland\n\n# total unicorns in the world (since Scotland comprises 1/3 of the world's unicorn population)\ntotal_unicorns_world = 3 * total_unicorns_scotland\n\n# unicorns outside Scotland\nunicorns_outside_scotland = total_unicorns_world - total_unicorns_scotland\nprint(unicorns_outside_scotland)\n```\nSo, there are 18 unicorns left in the world excluding Scotland."
