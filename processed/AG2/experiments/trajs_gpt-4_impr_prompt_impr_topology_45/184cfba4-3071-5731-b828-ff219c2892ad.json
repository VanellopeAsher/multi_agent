Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. \n    Given that each small stuffed animal costs $40, it means each large stuffed animal costs 3*$40= $120.\n\n2. She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.\n    This allows us to state s = 2*l.\n\n3. She earned $1200 from the sales. We represent this as a total price equation, \n    considering that the total money obtained is the sum of money from selling small and large stuffed animals: $40*s + $120*l = $1200.\n\nNow we can solve the problem in three steps:\n\n- Step 1: From the second equation, substitute the s in the total price equation with 2*l.\n\n- Step 2: Solve the obtained equation in step 1 for l.\n\n- Step 3: Substitute the obtained l value in the equation s = 2*l to get the value of s.\n\n- For verification, test the obtained s and l values in the total price equation to see if they equal $1200. \n\nLet's solve this."

The ‘s_value’ variable is an instance of the 'Equality' class which caused some issues when performing multiplication operations. The correct approach should be to get the right-hand side of the 's_value' equation and multiply it by 40 for subsequent checks.\n\nI also realize that in the check section, the equality check ('==' operator) doesn't return a simple boolean value because it returns a symbolic equality which can be either true or false depending on the particular real numbers 's_value' and 'l_value' take on.
