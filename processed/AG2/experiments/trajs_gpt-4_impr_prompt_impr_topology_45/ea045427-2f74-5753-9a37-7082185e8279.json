Calculate the cost of two ballpens which is $0.5 x 2 = $1.00\n4. Add the cost of one notebook to the cost of two ballpens to get the cost basis for the pencil case. This is $1.50 + $1.00  = $2.50.\n5. The pencil case price is twice the cost basis, so the pencil case costs 2 x $2.50 = $5.00 \n6. Sum up the cost of 5 notebooks, 1 ballpen, and the pencil case to find out the total amount that William spent. This is $7.50 + $0.5 + $5.00 = $13.00\n\nSo, William spent $13.00 in total."
