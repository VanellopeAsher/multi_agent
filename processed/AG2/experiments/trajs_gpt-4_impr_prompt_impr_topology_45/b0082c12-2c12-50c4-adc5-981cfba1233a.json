In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "The cost incurred for the kitten can be broken down into three parts - \n1. Cost of spaying which is $200. \n\n2. Cost of vaccines: Each vaccine costs $20, and there are 3 vaccines. This amounts to 3 * 20 = $60. However,  Leah received a 10% discount on the total vaccine cost, meaning Leah only pays 90% of the total vaccine cost. This amounts to 0.90 * $60 = $54.\n\n3. Cost of broken vases: Each broken vase costs $12, and there were 4 broken vases. Thus, the total cost for the broken vases was 4 * 12 = $48.\n\nTo find the total cost incurred for the kitten, the cost of each part can be added together. This amounts to $200 for spaying, $54 for vaccines, and $48 for the broken vases, which totals up to $200 + $54 + $48 = $302. Hence, the kitten has cost Leah $302 so far."

Calculate the total cost of the vaccines before discount: Multiply the cost of each vaccine by the number of vaccines. \n\n2. Calculate the total cost of vaccines after discount: Subtract the discount from the total cost of vaccines.\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of the vases broken by the kitten: Multiply the cost of each vase by the number of vases. \n\n4. Calculate the total cost incurred by the kitten: Add the cost of spaying, the total cost of vaccines after discount, and the total cost of broken vases. \n\n```python\n# Spaying cost\nspaying_cost = 200  \n\n# Cost of each vaccine\neach_vaccine_cost = 20  \n\n# Number of vaccines\nnum_vaccine = 3  \n\n# Cost of each vase\neach_vase_cost = 12  \n\n# Number of vases\nnum_vase = 4  \n\n# Vaccine discount\nvaccine_discount = 10  # it's 10%\n\n# Calculate total cost of vaccines before discount\ntotal_vaccine_cost_before_discount = each_vaccine_cost * num_vaccine  \n\n# Calculate total cost of vaccines after discount\ntotal_vaccine_cost_after_discount = total_vaccine_cost_before_discount * (1 - vaccine_discount / 100) \n\n# Calculate total cost of vases broken by the kitten\ntotal_vase_cost = each_vase_cost * num_vase  \n\n# Calculate total cost incurred by the kitten\ntotal_cost = spaying_cost + total_vaccine_cost_after_discount + total_vase_cost\n```\n\n## Display Results\nPrint the total cost incurred by Leah so far - which is stored in the variable, `total_cost`.\n\n```python\nprint(total_cost)\n``` \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
