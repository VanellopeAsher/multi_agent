      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand that a rectangle has four sides - two longer sides and two shorter sides. The length of paper that James needs to buy should be equivalent to the total perimeter of the rectangle.\n\nThe formula to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle is:\n```Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)```\n\nJames' fence is a rectangle with a length of 20.5 feet and a width of 15.5 feet. Substitute these values into the formula, we will get:\n```Perimeter = 2 * (20.5 + 15.5)```\n\nBy executing this calculation, we can find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy."
