Knowing that Jake is buying 20 T-shirts, 10 of them are full price and 10 of them are 50% off due to the buy one get one 50% off deal.\n\n    - For 10 full-priced T-shirts, the total cost would be 10 * $80 = $800. \n    - For the remaining 10 T-shirts (50% off), the total cost would be 10 * $80 * 0.5 = $400.\n\n2. We then calculate the price for the shoes. The shoes are 40% off, so the price would be $400 * 0.6 = $240.\n\n3.  Finally, we sum up the cost for T-shirts and the shoes to find out the total amount Jake spends:\n\n   - Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes\n   - Total cost = $800 (from step 1) + $400 (from step 1) + $240 (from step 2).\n\nThe total cost will be the final answer."
