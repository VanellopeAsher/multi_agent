In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Solution:\n\nLet's denote Brooke's present age as B, and Seth's present age as S.\n\nFrom the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1. S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke).\n   \n2. S + 3 + B + 3 = 36 (In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36).\n\nWe can now solve this system of equations. By substituting the first equation into the second equation, we can find the values of B and S.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 3 + B + 3 = 36\n2. Simplify the equation: 3B + 6 = 36\n3. Subtract 6 from both sides: 3B = 30\n4. Divide both sides by 3: B = 10\n\nThen substitute B = 10 into the first equation S = 2B to find the age of Seth:\n\n1. S = 2 * 10\n2. S = 20\n\nSo, Seth is 20 years old."
