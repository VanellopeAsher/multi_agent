In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. First, determine the number of cookies Katarina has which is given to be 6.8 times ten, i.e., 68 cookies.\n   \n2. Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina. Therefore, the number of cookies Max has is 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.\n   \n3. The Cookie Monster has ten fewer cookies than the number of cookies Max has divided by 1.2. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has (73 / 1.2) - 10  = 60.83 cookies. However, since we can't really have a fraction of a cookie, we'll consider it as 61 cookies assuming it's rounded to the nearest whole number.\n   \n4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.\n   \n5. To find the total number of cookies, add the number of cookies each person has: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer)\n   \nI will leave the final calculation to Agent_Code_Executor.
