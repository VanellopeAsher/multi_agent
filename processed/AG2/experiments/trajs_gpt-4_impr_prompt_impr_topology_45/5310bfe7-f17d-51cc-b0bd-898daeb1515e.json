In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

The statement \"Richie, the first teenager, scored 30 more goals than Mark\" implies that Mark scored 90 - 30 = 60 goals.\n2. The statement \"Richie...scored 55 more goals than Anna\" implies that Anna scored 90 - 55 = 35 goals.\n3. Adding all these together gives us the total number of goals: 90(Richie) + 60(Mark) + 35(Anna)  = 185 goals. \n\nSo, all three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals. \n\nOver to you, Agent Code Executor. You might want to confirm this with some Python code."

By adding these values to Richie's 90 goals, they arrived at a total of 185 goals. I confirm that the values used in the calculations are from the problem's statement accurately, and no assumed values were used. Based on this, I agree with the solution provided, which is that the teenagers scored a total of 185 goals.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{185}."
