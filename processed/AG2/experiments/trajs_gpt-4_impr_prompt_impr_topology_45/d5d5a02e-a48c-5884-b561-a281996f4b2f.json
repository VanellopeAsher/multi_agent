In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "First, we need to identify the relationships given in the question. The question tells us:\n\n- Emil is 21 years old now.\n- When Emil is 26, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother.\n\nLet's denote Emil's dad's age as A and his brother's age as B.\n\nSo, we can form 2 equations as follows:\n\n1) For Emil's dad: A - 5 (age now) = 2 * (26) (Emil's age in 5 years)\n\n2) For Emil's brother: B + 5 (age in 5 years) = 1/2 * (26) (Emil's age in 5 years)\n\nWe should be able to solve these equations to find the solutions for A and B. After finding A and B, we can then find their sum A + B to answer the question.\n\nHence, the solution path is:\n- Specify the relationships and translate them into mathematical expressions\n- Solve the formed expressions for A and B\n- Add A and B to find their sum."

The Solver proposed two equations: \n\n1) A - 5 = 2 * 26\n2) B + 5 = 26 / 2\n\nSolving these:\n\n1) A = 2 * 26 + 5 = 57 (Emil's dad's current age)\n2) B = 26 / 2 - 5 = 8 (Emil's brother's current age)\n\nThe sum of their ages is then A + B = 57 + 8 = 65, which matches the Code Executor's result.\n\nTherefore, I agree with both the Agent Problem Solver's analysis and Agent Code Executor's computation.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{65}"
