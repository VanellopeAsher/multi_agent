      "content": "The first step is to figure out the total time John spent during his vacation. This can be calculated by understanding that the non-sightseeing activities accounted for 30% of the total time. \n\nHere's how we arrive at the solution:\n\n1. Find out how much time John spent on non-sightseeing activities. We know he spent 6 hours boating and half of that time swimming. That's 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) = 9 hours. He also watched 3 different shows which are 2 hours each.  So that's 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours. Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 9 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours.\n\n2. Since the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows represents 30% of the total time John spent, we can now calculate the  total time by dividing the time spent on these activities by 30% (or 0.3). That's 15 hours / 0.3 = 50 hours.\n\n3. Finally, to find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we subtract the time spent on non-sightseeing activities from the total time. That's 50 hours (total time) - 15 hours (non-sightseeing activities) = 35 hours. \n\nSo, John spent 35 hours sightseeing."

Use the information that these activities took 30% of his total time to find the total time he spent on his vacation.\n3. Subtract the time spent on these activities from the total time to find the time spent sightseeing. \n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Time spent on boating\nboating_time = 6 \n\n# Time spent on swimming is half the boating time\nswimming_time = boating_time / 2 \n\n# Time spent on shows, 3 shows 2 hours each\nshows_time = 3 * 2\n\n# Time spent on non-sightseeing activities \nnon_sightseeing_time = boating_time + swimming_time + shows_time \n\n# Non_sightseeing time is 30% of total time\ntotal_time = non_sightseeing_time / 0.3 \n\n# Sightseeing time is total time - non_sightseeing_time\nsightseeing_time = total_time - non_sightseeing_time\n\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the time John spent sightseeing."

Both methods correctly analyzed and solved the problem. \n\nThe description was broken down into manageable parts, and the total time for the activities excluding sightseeing was calculated first. Since this was given to be 30% of the total time, the total time could then be calculated. From the total time, when the time of activities excluding sightseeing was then subtracted, we could determine the time John has spent sightseeing - which is 35 hours.\n\nAll clues provided in the problem were used, and the solution corresponds with the initial problem, hence it can be considered correct."
