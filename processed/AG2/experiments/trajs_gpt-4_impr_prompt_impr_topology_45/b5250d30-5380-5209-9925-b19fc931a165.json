      "content": "To solve this question, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Since Jill and her friends watch 4 films every Saturday, they will watch 4 films * 4 Saturdays = 16 films in 4 weeks.\n\n2. On Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays. Therefore, they watch 4 films/2 = 2 films each Sunday. So, over 4 Sundays they will watch 2 films * 4 Sundays = 8 films.\n\n3. To find the total number of films they watch in 4 weeks, add the number of films watched on Saturdays to the number of films watched on Sundays. Therefore, the total number of films they watch is 16 films (from Saturdays) + 8 films (from Sundays) = 24 films. \n\nSo, Jill and her friends can watch a total of 24 films in 4 weeks if they follow this routine."

Calculate the number of films watched on Sunday (which is half what is watched on Saturday) and multiply it by 4 (number of weeks),\n3. Finally, add the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the total number of films watched in 4 weeks.\n\n```python\n# Number of films watched on Saturdays\nfilms_on_saturday = 4\n\n# Number of films watched on Sundays\nfilms_on_sunday = films_on_saturday / 2\n\n# Number of weeks\nweeks = 4\n\n# Calculate total films watched on Saturdays in 4 weeks\ntotal_films_on_saturdays = films_on_saturday * weeks\n\n# Calculate total films watched on Sundays in 4 weeks\ntotal_films_on_sundays = films_on_sunday * weeks\n\n# Calculate total films watched in 4 weeks\ntotal_films = total_films_on_saturdays + total_films_on_sundays\n\nprint(total_films)\n```\nI suggest executing the above code.

Following the information given, they proposed that 16 films are watched on Saturdays (4 films per Saturday over 4 weeks) and 8 films on Sundays (half as many as Saturday over 4 weeks). This totals 24 films.\n\nAgent_Code_Executor proposed a similar solution translated into Python code, which when executed provided the same solution of 24.0. \n\nThe solutions align and calculations are based on factual information from the problem description.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is that Jill and her friends can watch a total of 24 films in a span of 4 weeks if they maintain their routine.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 24"
