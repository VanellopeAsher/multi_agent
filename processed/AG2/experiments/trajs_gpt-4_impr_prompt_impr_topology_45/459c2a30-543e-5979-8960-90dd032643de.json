      "content": "Here's how to solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, determine the number of different colored squares. \n\n    - We know there are 14 red squares.\n    \n    - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so 14 (red) + 4 = 18 blue squares.\n    \n    - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so 18 (blue) + 6 = 24 green squares.\n\n\n2. Once we know the number of squares for these three colors (red, blue, and green), we add them together to find out the total non-white squares on the comforter. \n\n    - This is 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) = 56 non-white squares.\n\n\n3. Since the total size of Britanny's comforter is 68 square feet, we subtract the total non-white square feet from 68:\n\n   - This gives us 68 (total area of the comforter) - 56 (non-white areas) = 12 white squares.\n\nSo, the difference between the number of white squares and green squares is 24 (green) - 12 (white) = 12.\n\nConclusion: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares."
