The profit per bag can be calculated by subtracting the cost price per bag ($4) from the selling price per bag ($8). \n\n2. Calculate the total number of bags sold. This can be done by dividing the total profit ($160) by the profit per bag (calculated in step 1).\n\n3. Figure out how many packs of bags were bought. Since each pack contains 5 bags, divide the total number of bags sold (from step 2) by 5 to find out how many packs Tara bought. \n\nNow let's proceed with these steps."

In order to find the number of packs Tara bought, we should multiply the total number of bags sold by the number of bags per pack (which is 5). Let me correct this.\n\nUsing the steps provided by Agent_Problem_Solver:\n\n1. We first calculate the profit made per bag by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.\n2. Next, we find the total number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.\n3.
