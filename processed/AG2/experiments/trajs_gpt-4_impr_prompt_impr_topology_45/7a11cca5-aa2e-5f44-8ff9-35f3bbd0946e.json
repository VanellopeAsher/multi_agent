We're told this is 4000 gallons.\n\n2. Next, we find out how much water passes through the river after a day of heavy rain. The problem tells us this amount doubles what we have on a normal day, meaning it's 4000 gallons * 2  = 8000 gallons.\n\n3. For the third day, we are given the total volume of water that passes through the river. This quantity is specified as 14000 gallons.\n\n4. To find the increase in the amount of water on the third day, we would subtract the total water volume of the second day from the total volume of the third day. Thus, the increase would be 14000 gallons - 8000 gallons.\n\n5. The result from the above calculation will tell us by how much the volume of water increased on the third day. \n\nLet's calculate it now."

On a normal day, the river flows with a volume of 4000 gallons at the given point. This volume doubles to reach 8000 gallons after a day of heavy rain. On the third day, the total volume of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons. As a result, the increase from the second day to the third day is 6000 gallons.
