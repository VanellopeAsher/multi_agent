For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "Let x represent the number of car tires that the mechanic repaired on Friday. \n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total income from Thursday would be 60(6) + 40(4) = $600.\n\nSince the mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, the total income from Friday would be $600 - $40 = $560.\n\nFrom the information provided, we know that the only source of income on Friday was from the repaired car tires. Each car tire repair is charged $40. \n\nTherefore, if we divide the total income from Friday by the cost per car tire repair, we can find the number of car tires that were repaired on Friday. This gives us: $560/$40 = 14\n\nSo, the mechanic repaired 14 car tires on Friday."
