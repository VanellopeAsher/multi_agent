Calculate the total hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week.\n2. Multiply this number by Jordan's hourly wage.\n\nIn Python, we would:\n\n- Set Jordan's daily gaming time (`hours_per_day`) to 3.\n- Set the number of days in a week (`days_per_week`) to 7.\n- Set Jordan's hourly wage (`hourly_wage`) to 10.\n\nThen, calculate total hours (`total_hours`) as `hours_per_day` multiplied by `days_per_week`.\n\nFinally, calculate total earnings as `total_hours` multiplied by `hourly_wage`.\n\nLet's implement this calculation."

He assumes that Jordan would work the same hours every day of the week that he usually spends playing video games. Then, he multiplies these total hours by Jordan's hourly wage to get the total earnings that Jordan would make if he was working instead of playing video games. According to Agent Code Executor's calculations, Jordan would make $210 in a week. \n\nThe solution from Agent Problem Solver was based on the same logic and assumptions as that from Agent Code Executor.\n\nGiven these observations and the nature of the problem, I agree with the solution. There are no leaps in logic or assumptions of unspecified variables in the given problem. The calculations are correct. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{210}**. Do note, this solution is under the assumption that Jordan would be able to work the same hours he plays video games, and his working conditions would allow it."
