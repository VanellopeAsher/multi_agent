      "content": "We need to compute the total cost of all items factoring in the 10% non-food tax. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Label the items as food or non-food. John's groceries include both food and non-food items.\n    - Food: milk, eggs\n    - Non-food: light bulbs, cups, roach traps\n\n2. Calculate the cost of all food items. We can do this by summing up the cost of all food items:\n    - Cost of milk: $2\n    - Cost of eggs: $3\n    - Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5\n    \n3. Compute the cost of all non-food items and the added tax:\n    - Cost of light bulbs: $3\n    - Cost of cups: $3\n    - Cost of roach traps: $4\n    - Total cost of non-food items before tax: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10\n    - The tax is 10% of the total cost of non-food items: 0.1 * $10 = $1. Therefore, the total cost of non-food items with tax is $10 + $1 = $11.\n    \n4. Sum up the total cost of food and non-food items to determine the overall cost: $5 + $11 = $16. So, the total cost of all the items for John is $16."
