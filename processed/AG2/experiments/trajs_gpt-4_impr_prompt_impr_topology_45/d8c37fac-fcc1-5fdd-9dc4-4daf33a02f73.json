Multiply the number of petunias per basket (30) by the cost per petunia ($3.00), and by the number of baskets (50). \n\n2. Second, calculate the total cost of sweet potato vines. Multiply the number of sweet potato vines per basket (20) by the cost per vine ($2.50), and again by the number of baskets (50). \n\n3. Finally, add the total cost of the petunias and the total cost of the sweet potato vines to find the total cost of filling all 50 hanging baskets. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculation. \n"
