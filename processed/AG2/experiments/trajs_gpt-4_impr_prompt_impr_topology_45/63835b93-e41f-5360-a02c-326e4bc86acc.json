Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

As there are two vaccines, it'll total to $60.\n    - Damaged vases cost: $15 per vase. The kitten broke 3 vases, amounting to $45.\n2. To calculate the total cost, we add all these costs. \n\nThis problem can be solved by adding these values together. It doesn't involve any complex mathematical operations, so we can do it without needing to write any code. "

Add the total vaccine cost (which is 2 vaccines times $30 each) to the total cost.\n3. Add the total cost of the broken vases (which is 3 vases times $15 each) to the total cost.\n\nFinally, print the total cost."

Now, it is time to evaluate them.\n\nAgent_Problem_Solver proposed an arithmetic solution, which seems correct:\n   - Neutering cost: $150\n   - Vaccine cost: 2 times $30 = $60\n   - Damaged vases cost: 3 times $15 = $45\n   - Total cost: $150 + $60 + $45 = $255\n\nAgent_Code_Executor proposed to solve it using Python, which should also lead to the same solution if executed. The costs are summed up in a similar way as in the non-coding solution.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the problem, both methods will work and should give us the same result. However, as this is a simple arithmetic problem that doesn't require any coding skills, I agree with Agent_Problem_Solver's solution $255. \n\nTherefore, the final solution to this problem is $255. The kitten so far has cost Leah $255. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{255}."
