To do so, we must multiply the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson, which is 84, by 1/3. \n\nSecond, we add the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu to the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson to find out the total number of messages delivered by James. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Find the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu: 84 * (1/3)\n2. Add this number to the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson: 84 + (84 * (1/3))\nThis will give us the total number of messages James delivers."

First, we had to understand that the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu was a fraction (1/3) of the ones delivered to Ms. Thompson. After we had that information, it was simple to do the calculations to get the total number of messages delivered. Python code was used to confirm the calculations. The results aligned perfectly."
