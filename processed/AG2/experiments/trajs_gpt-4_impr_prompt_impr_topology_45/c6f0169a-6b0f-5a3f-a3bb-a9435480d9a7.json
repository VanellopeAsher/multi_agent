This equals the total number of cars (20) minus the number of automatic cars (12) and manual cars (4). \n2. Then, find out the total number of available cars. You can do this by subtracting the 3 rented automatic cars and 2 under-maintenance manual cars from the total number of cars.\n3. Finally, calculate the percentage of the remaining cars that are semi-automatic. For this, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of remaining cars and then multiply by 100."

      "content": "I agree with Agent_Problem_Solver's reasoning. \n\nThe calculated percentage implies that more than a quarter of the available cars (approximately 27%) are semi-automatic. This implies that if a random car is selected from the available cars, there is about a 27% chance that it will be a semi-automatic car. \n\nThis analysis and the associated Python code can be very useful for the car rental company to manage its inventory and make data-driven decisions, such as which type of cars to purchase more of in the future."
