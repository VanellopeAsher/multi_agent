This gives us: 3 * 26 = 78 letters.\n   \n3. Elise writes half of it once. Half of 26 is 13, so 13 letters are added to her total.\n   \n4. At this point, Elise has written a total of 78 + 13 = 91 letters.\n   \n5. Elise then re-writes everything she has already written. This doubles her current total, 91 * 2 = 182.\n\nSo in total, Elise has written 182 letters."

First, the English alphabet contains 26 letters. This matches the problem statement and is a well-known fact; no assumptions were made here.\n2. Elise wrote the full alphabet three times (3 * 26 = 78 letters). This calculation is accurate.\n3. She wrote half the alphabet next, which equates to 13 letters. The calculation (26/2 = 13) is correct.\n4. At this point, Elise has written 91 letters (78 + 13), which matches what both agents propose.\n5. In the final step, Elise re-writes all the letters she has already written, doubling the total to 182 (91 * 2). This is correct and aligns with both agents' solutions.\n\nHaving assessed both solutions and found no discrepancies or assumptions, I confirm that Elise has written 182 letters in total.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{182}."
