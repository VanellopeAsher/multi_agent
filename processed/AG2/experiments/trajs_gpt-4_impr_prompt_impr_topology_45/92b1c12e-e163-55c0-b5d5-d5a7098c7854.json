The variables in this case are the ages of Carver's son and daughter. Following these steps:\n\n1. From the statement \"Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter\", we set up the following equation: 2 * daughter's age - 5 = 45. \n\n2. From the statement \"His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son\", we set up the following equation: 3 * son's age + 4 = daughter's age.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations: \n\n(i)  2 * D - 5 = 45 \n(ii) D = 3 * S + 4\n\nWhere D is the daughter's age and S is the son's age. \n\nWe can now solve this system of equations to find the son's age (S)."
