Add up these totals.\n3. Subtract this sum from the total number of TVs sold to find out the number of OLED TVs sold.\n\nLet's get started.\n\n```python\n# total no of TVs sold\ntotal_tvs = 40\n\n# calculate smart TVs sold\nsmart_tvs = total_tvs * 1/4\n\n# calculate analog TVs sold\nanalog_tvs = total_tvs * 1/8\n\n# calculate projection TVs sold\nprojection_tvs = total_tvs * 1/5\n\n# calculate total TVs sold excluding OLED\ntotal_other_tvs = smart_tvs + analog_tvs + projection_tvs\n\n# calculate OLED TVs sold\noled_tvs = total_tvs - total_other_tvs\n\nprint(oled_tvs)\n```\nNow let's execute this code.

The Agent Code Executor followed the same process and got 17 TVs as a result. Let's see:\n\nSmart TVs: 40 * 1/4 = 10 TVs - which is one-fourth of 40.\nAnalog TVs: 40 * 1/8 = 5 TVs - which is one-eighth of 40. \nProjection TVs: 40 * 1/5 = 8 TVs - This is one-fifth of 40. \n\nIf we add the smart, analog, and projection TVs, we get 23 TVs. These values confirm both agents' procedure.\n\nLet's subtract this total (23) from the total number of TVs (40), we get the correct number of OLED TVs sold - \n\nOLED TVs: 40 - 23 = 17 TVs \n\nBoth solutions satisfy the condition. Hence, the solution is correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{17}."
