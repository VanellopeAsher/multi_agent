In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

So, we multiply 3.5 miles by 3 to get the total miles ran on these days.\n2. Sam ran 5.5 miles on two days (Tuesday and Thursday). So, we multiply 5.5 miles by 2 to get the total miles ran on these days.\n3. Finally, add the total miles from step 1 and step 2 to get the total miles ran in a week.\n\nLet's calculate this in the next steps."
