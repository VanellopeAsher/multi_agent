Two packets of stones were each priced at $2.50, so 2 multiplied by $2.50 equals $5.00.\n3. There were three coral pieces, each priced at $2.00, so 3 multiplied by $2.00 equals $6.00.\n4. She bought 20 fish, each priced at $0.50, so 20 multiplied by $0.50 equals $10.00.\n5. A packet of fish food cost $2.00.\n\nAdding up all these amounts will give us the total amount that Scarlett spent."
