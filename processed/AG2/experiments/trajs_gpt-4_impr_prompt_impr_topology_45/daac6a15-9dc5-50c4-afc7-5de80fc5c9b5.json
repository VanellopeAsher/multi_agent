However, we should also take into account the number of days in June to get the total amount Derrick makes in June, which has 30 days.\n\nSo, let's calculate.\n\n1. Calculate the daily revenue: one doughnut's price multiplied by the number of doughnuts per day (2 * 500).\n2. Find the total monthly revenue for June: daily revenue multiplied by the number of days in June.\n\nLet's execute this calculation."

The Python code calculates daily revenue as $2 (price per doughnut) * 500 (number of doughnuts), then multiplies the daily revenue by 30 (number of days in June). \n\nThe executed Python code resulted in a total monthly revenue of $30000 for June. \n\nGiven both solutions, the final solution seems to be correct. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** \\boxed{30000} in dollars."
