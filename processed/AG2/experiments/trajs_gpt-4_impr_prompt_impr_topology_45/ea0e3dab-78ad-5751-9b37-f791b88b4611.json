This means 200 * 6 = $1200 for the first half of the year.\n\n2. Calculate the reduced price she had to pay for the second half of the year: the price was reduced by 15%, which means she had to pay only 85% of the initial price each month. This means 85/100 * 200 = $170 each month. For 6 months, she had to pay 170 * 6 = $1020.\n\n3. Add up the amounts she paid in the first half and in the second half of the year: 1200 + 1020 = $2220. \n\nHence, the total amount she had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $2220."
