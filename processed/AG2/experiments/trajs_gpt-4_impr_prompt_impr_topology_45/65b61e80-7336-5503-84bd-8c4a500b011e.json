      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to know how many eggs were hidden in total. Since the Smith twins each found 30 eggs, and there were 10 eggs left after the friends found the rest, we can work out the number of eggs the friends found by following these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins by multiplying the number of eggs each twin found by 2. Hence, Total_Smiths_Eggs = 30 (eggs found by each twin) * 2 (twins) = 60 eggs.\n2. Since we know that there were 10 eggs left unfound after the friends did their search, we can deduce that the total number of eggs hidden initially is the sum of the eggs found by the Smith twins and the eggs left unfound. Thus, Total_Eggs_Hidden = Total_Smiths_Eggs + Unfound_Eggs = 60 eggs (found by the Smith twins) + 10 eggs (left unfound) = 70 eggs.\n3. Given this, the number of eggs found by their friends is the difference between the total eggs hidden and the eggs found by the Smith twins. Hence, Eggs_Found_By_Friends = Total_Eggs_Hidden - Total_Smiths_Eggs = 70 eggs (total initially hidden) - 60 eggs (found by the Smith twins) = 10 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the friends found 10 eggs."

As has been outlined by the agents, the procedure to solve this problem is as follows:\n1. Determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins (30 eggs per twin, thus 60 eggs in total)\n2. Add the 10 eggs that were not found to the total found by the twins to have a total of 70 eggs\n3. Subtract the number found by the twins from the total number of eggs (70 eggs - 60 eggs), which leads us to the conclusion that the friends found 10 eggs. So, the friends found 10 eggs during the Easter egg hunt."
