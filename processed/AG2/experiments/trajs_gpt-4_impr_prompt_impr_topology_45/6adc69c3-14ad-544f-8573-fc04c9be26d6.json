In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "First, we need to understand that the ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts and then each of those parts is cut into 5 equal parts. This means that the ribbon is effectively divided into 20 (4*5) equal parts.\n\nWe also know that each of the final parts is 5 cm long. \n\nThus, we can calculate the total length of the ribbon as follows:\n\n1. Multiply the length of each final part (5 cm) by the total number of parts (20). This will give the total length of the ribbon.\n\nSo, \n\nTotal length of the ribbon = Number of parts * Length of each part.\nTotal length of the ribbon = 20 (parts) * 5 (cm).\nTotal length of the ribbon = 100 cm. \n\nTherefore, the total length of the ribbon Marty has is 100 cm. \n\nI'll hand over to Agent_Code_Executor to confirm this with a Python code."

This is because the total number of divisions in the ribbon (20, computed from 4 divided parts and each of those further divided into 5 parts) each of 5 cm length. The total length can be obtained by multiplying the number of parts with the length of each part (20*5 = 100 cm).
