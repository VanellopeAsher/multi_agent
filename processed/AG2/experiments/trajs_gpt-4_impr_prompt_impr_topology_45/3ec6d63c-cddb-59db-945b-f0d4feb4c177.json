      "content": "Based on the outputs of both \"Agent Code Executor\" and \"Agent Problem Solver\", it is clear that their solutions align. They both calculated the total number of bucks first by multiplying the total number of deer by the proportion of bucks, and then they found the number of 6-point bucks by applying the percentage of 6-point bucks to the total number of bucks. Finally, they rounded to the nearest whole number since it's not possible to have a fraction of a buck, yielding a final solution of 12.\n\nTherefore, based on my evaluation of their solutions, we can conclude that there are 12 6-point bucks in the field. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}."
