      "content": "Here's how to solve it:\n\nLet's denote the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday as X\n\nThe same amount is made on Wednesday, so we have another X for that day.\n\nOn Friday, double that amount is made, so that's 2X\n\nThe total amount made on these three days is 500, so\n\nX (Tuesday) + X (Wednesday) + 2X (Friday) = 500\n\nThis simplifies to 4X = 500\n\nSo, to solve for X, you divide 500 by 4, which gives us 125.\n\nTherefore, the burrito shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday."
