In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Since the shortest tree is 60 feet, the second tree is 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet.\n2. The combined height of the two shorter trees is 60 feet + 110 feet = 170 feet.\n3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so the tallest tree is 2 * 170 feet = 340 feet.\n   \nIn conclusion, the tallest tree is 340 feet tall."
