      "content": "Step-by-step solution:\n\nStep 1: Initially, they had 19 bandages.\nStep 2: They ordered one bulk pack of bandages, adding 50 bandages (since one bulk pack contains 50 bandages).\nSo, by the end of the first day, they had 19 + 50 = 69 bandages.\nStep 3: On the second day, they used ten fewer than they did on the first day.\nLet's consider that they used \"b\" bandages on the first day. Therefore, they used (\"b-10\") on the second day.\nStep 4: On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, adding 100 bandages (50 bandages per bulk pack * 2 = 100 bandages).\nStep 5: They used half a pack on the third day, which is 25 bandages (since a pack contains 50 bandages).\nStep 6: They have 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\nLet's put these into an equation:\nThe total bandages at the end of first day (69), minus bandages used on first day (b), plus bandages at the start of second day (0), minus bandages used on second day (b - 10), plus total bandages at the start of the third day (100), minus bandages used on the third day (25) should equal the total bandages left at the end of third day (78).\nThis gives us this equation:\n\n69 - b + 0 - (b - 10) + 100 - 25 = 78\n\nFrom this, we can calculate b, the number of bandages used on the first day."
