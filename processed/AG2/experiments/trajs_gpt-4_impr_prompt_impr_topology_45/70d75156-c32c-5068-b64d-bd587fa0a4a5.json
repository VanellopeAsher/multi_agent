      "content": "With this information, we know that Mrs. Harrington started with 8 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges, so she initially had 8 * 20 = 160 oranges. \n\nShe gave 2 boxes of oranges each to her mom and her sister. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 2 * 20 * 2 = 80 oranges.\n\nThis leaves her with 160 - 80 = 80 oranges.\n\nShe kept 1/4 of these oranges, so she kept 80 * 1/4 = 20 oranges.\n\nThe rest of the oranges are what she sold. This means she sold 80 - 20 = 60 oranges.\n\nThus, Mrs. Harrington sold 60 oranges."

      "content": "Sure, now that we know Mrs. Harrington bought 8 boxes of oranges at the market, let's solve the problem:\n\n1. Each box contains 20 oranges and she bought 8 boxes so the total number of oranges she bought is 20 oranges/box * 8 boxes = 160 oranges.\n\n2. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. A box contains 20 oranges so she gave away 2 boxes/person * 20 oranges/box * 2 persons = 80 oranges.\n\n3. After giving away oranges, Mrs. Harrington kept for herself 160 oranges - 80 oranges = 80 oranges.\n\n4. She then kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest, meaning she kept 80 oranges * 1/4 = 20 oranges and sold the rest.\n\n5. Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 80 oranges - 20 oranges = 60 oranges."
