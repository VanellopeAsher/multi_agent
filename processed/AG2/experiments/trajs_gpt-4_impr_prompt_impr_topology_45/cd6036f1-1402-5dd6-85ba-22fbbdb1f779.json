      "content": "The solution to this problem can be obtained in the following steps:\n\n1. Start with Mark's final weight after recovery, which is 70 pounds. \n2. Then, consider the weight he regained during recovery. He regained 5 pounds per month for 2 months, making a total of 10 pounds. \n3. To get his weight just after he was ill (before he started regaining weight), add the weight he regained to his final weight. This gives 70 + 10 = 80 pounds.\n4. Now, consider the weight he lost when he was unwell. He lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, making a total of 30 pounds.\n5. To get his initial weight before he fell ill, add the weight he lost due to illness to his weight just after illness. This gives 80 + 30 = 110 pounds.\n\nTherefore, before he fell ill, Mark weighed 110 pounds."

      "content": "Let's resolve this problem step by step. \n\n1. Mark's final weight after recovery is given as 70 pounds.\n2. During his recovery, he regained 5 pounds each month for 2 months. So, the total weight he regained is 2*5 = 10 pounds.\n3. To find out his weight after he fell sick (but before recovery), we add what he regained to his final weight, which results in 70+10 = 80 pounds.\n4. While being sick, he lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, hence, the total weight lost is 10*3 = 30 pounds.\n5. Finally, to find out his initial weight before he fell sick, we add what he lost to his weight after sickness, which gets us 80+30 = 110 pounds.\n\nSo, Mark weighed 110 pounds before he fell ill. Let's execute this calculation in python to confirm."
