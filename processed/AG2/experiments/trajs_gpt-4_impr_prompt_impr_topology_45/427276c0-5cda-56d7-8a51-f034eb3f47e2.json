Multiply the quantity of each type of heels by their height.\n2. Add the total height of both groups of heels.\n3. Determine the total number of women at the party, which is the sum of the women in both groups.\n4.  Compute the average by dividing the total height of heels by the total number of women.\n\nLet's apply these steps to our specific case.\n\n1. Total height for the first group: 3 women * 4.5 inches = 13.5 inches\n2. Total height for the second group: 3 women * 2.5 inches = 7.5 inches\n3. Add these two amounts: 13.5 inches + 7.5 inches = 21 inches\n4. The number of women at the party is: 3 women + 3 women = 6 women\n5. Finally, divide the total height by the number of women to find the average: 21 inches / 6 women = 3.5 inches/woman\n\nSo, the average height of heels at this party is 3.5 inches."

I can confirm that the calculations are indeed correct. The manual approach was clear and the Python code was executed correctly, leading to the correct answer. The calculation of the average took into account the number of women wearing each type of heel as well as the height of each type of heel. Thus, the methods followed are logical, accurate, and efficient in finding the average height of heels at the cocktail party."
