      "content": "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1. Since the price increased by 80% in December, this means it increased from its original value of $4000. To work out what the increased price is, we multiply the original price by 80% (or 0.8) and then add this to the original price. $4000 * 0.8 = $3200. This is the amount it increased by, so we add this to the original price to get the new price: $4000 + $3200 = $7200.\n\n2. For the discount in January, we need to reduce the price by 50%. To do this we multiply the December price by 50% or 0.5. So, $7200 * 0.5 = $3600.\n\nTherefore, if the toy was discounted by 50% in January after the price increase of 80% in December, the price of the toy would be $3600."

We will use the formula: new price = old price + old price * (percentage change/100) for the increase in price and new price = old price - old price * (percentage decrease/100) for the decrease in price.\n\n```python\n# Initial price of the toy\nold_price = 4000\n\n# Calculate the price increase in December using the formula \ndec_increase = 80\ndecember_price = old_price + old_price * (dec_increase/100)\n\n# Calculate the price decrease in January using the formula \njan_decrease = 50\njanuary_price = december_price - december_price * (jan_decrease/100)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(january_price)\n```\nThe Python code will confirm the calculated solution."
