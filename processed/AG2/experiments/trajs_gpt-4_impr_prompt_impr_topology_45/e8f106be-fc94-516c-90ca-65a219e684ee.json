His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

      "content": "To determine the length of crepe-paper streamers James needs for his backyard fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of his rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Double the sum of the length and the width of the fence: 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet)\n2. We don't need to deduct anything for the tree since James doesn't plan to hang any streamers on it.\n3. The result from step 1 is the total length of crepe paper that James needs to buy. \n\nLet's calculate this now."
