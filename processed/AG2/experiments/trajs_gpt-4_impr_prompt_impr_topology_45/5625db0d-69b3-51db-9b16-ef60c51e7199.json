So, the total cost of apples before the discount is  15*$15\n        - After she applied her voucher, she got $3 off. Therefore, her final price is calculated by deducting $3 from the total cost of apples.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total price Sheila paid on Wednesday\n        - Sheila bought the same number of apples (15) but at a price of $25 each. So, the total cost of apples before the discount is 15*$25\n        - There was a 15% off discount on Wednesday. This discount is applied to the total price of the apples, leading to the final price that Sheila paid.\n\nStep 3: Find the difference in final prices\n        - Subtract the final price that Clara paid on Tuesday from the final price that Sheila paid on Wednesday to find the difference."

The difference that Sheila paid more for the apples compared to Clara is indeed $96.75. The price she paid was higher due to the cost of apples increasing from $15 to $25 from Tuesday to Wednesday and despite the 15% discount - which was not enough to offset this price increase."
