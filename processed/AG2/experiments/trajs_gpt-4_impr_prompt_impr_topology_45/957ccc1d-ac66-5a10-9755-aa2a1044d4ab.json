Since each pound requires burning 3500 calories, calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn by multiplying 30 by 3500.\n2. Identify the time frame from today (December 31st) until Andy's birthday (July 19th) in days.\n3. Divide the total number of calories Andy needs to burn by the number of days to obtain the daily calorie deficit (number of calories burned over calories consumed) that Andy has to maintain in order to reach his goal.\n\nLet's execute these steps next."

In other words, he should burn around 525 calories more than what he consumes each day from December 31st to July 19th.\n\nThe date range was established using the Date Time values associated with the given dates. After that, the total number of days was approximated. We accounted for this to get an accurate daily deficit considering all the days until Andy's birthday.\n\nFinally, we calculated the day-to-day calorie deficit by dividing the total calories Andy requires to lose by the total number of days available before his birthday."

This is the average amount of daily calorie deficit required for Andy to achieve his weight loss goal, assuming Andy maintains a consistent calorie intake and physical activity level throughout the period.\n"
