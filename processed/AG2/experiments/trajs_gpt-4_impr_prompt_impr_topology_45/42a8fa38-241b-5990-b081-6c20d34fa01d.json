The cost of tomato seeds was calculated by multiplying the quantity (20 packets) by the price per packet ($40), resulting in $800.\n\n2. The cost of celery seeds was calculated by multiplying the quantity (80 packets) by the price per packet ($30), which got us $2400.\n\n3. The final total cost of seeds was found by adding the cost of tomato seeds ($800) and the cost of celery seeds ($2400), therefore the total is $3200. \n\nThe consistency between the calculations and the Python-executed code also reaffirms our solution. So, we can confidently say that Mrs. Rylan spent $3200 on purchasing the seeds in April."
