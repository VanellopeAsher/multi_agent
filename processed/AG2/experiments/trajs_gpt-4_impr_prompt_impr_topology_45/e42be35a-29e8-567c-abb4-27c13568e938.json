      "content": "To solve this problem, let's go step by step:\n\n1. Greta made a batch of a dozen brownies. 12 brownies are there.\n2. At her office, she got half a dozen brownies, so that's 6 brownies (half of 12).\n3. Her friends made four dozen brownies for her, which means an additional 48 brownies (12 x 4).\n4. During the party, 18 brownies were eaten (12 + 6, which is 1 and half dozen). \n\nSo the total number of brownies Greta has left from the day would be the sum of  the brownies she made, the brownies she got from office, and the brownies her friends made, subtracted by the brownies that were eaten at the party. \n\nLet’s calculate:\n\n- For the first part: 12 (Greta’s batch) + 6 (Office brownies) + 48 (Friends’ batch) = 66 brownies\n- For the second part: 66 (total brownies) – 18 (eaten at party) = 48 (brownies left)"

Her office gave her a half-dozen (6) brownies.\n3. Her friends made four dozen (48) brownies for her.\n4. At the party, one and a half-dozen (18) brownies were eaten.\n\nSo, she had 12 (made by herself) + 6 (from her office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies total. Since 18 brownies were eaten at the party, she should have 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left over.\n\nBoth the agents' solutions are consistent with each other and with the problem statement so the final solution is the same as the proposed solution.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{48}**."
