      "content": "The first step in solving this problem is to find out the total number of smores needed. \n\nGiven that:\n- Each child wants 2 smores and there are 9 children. So the total number of smores required by children = 2 smores/child * 9 children = 18 smores.\n- Each adult wants 1 smore and there are 6 adults. So the total number of smores required by adults = 1 smore/adult * 6 adults = 6 smores.\n\nBy summing up the above numbers, we obtain the total number of smores required = 18 smores (children) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of smores that can be made with a box of graham crackers.\n\nWe know that:\n- 1 packet of graham crackers can make 8 smores.\n- A box of graham crackers contains 3 packets. Therefore, the total number of smores that can be made with 1 box = 8 smores/packet * 3 packets/box = 24 smores/box.\n\nTherefore, to make 24 smores, we would require 1 box of graham crackers.\n\nHence, 1 box of graham crackers is necessary.\n\nLet's bring this to the team discussion."

They then found the number of smores that can be made from one box of crackers using the given values (8 smores per packet Ã— 3 packets per box) and used that value to calculate how many boxes would be needed in total to fulfil the smores requirement. With all this, there was an agreement between both agents that 1 box of graham crackers would be necessary to make the required number of smores. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{1} (box of graham crackers)**"
