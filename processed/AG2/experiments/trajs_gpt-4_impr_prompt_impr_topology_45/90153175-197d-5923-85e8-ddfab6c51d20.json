In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Solution:\n\n1. **Quantity per day**: Claire eats 3 eggs per day, which she uses to make her omelet.\n2. **Quantity per week**: Since there are 7 days in a week, she will need 3*7 = 21 eggs per week. \n3. **Quantity for 12 weeks**: Multiplying this weekly amount by 12 (the number of weeks given), we get 21*12 = 252 eggs. \n4. **Conversion to dozens**: Since 1 dozen contains 12 items, the total number of dozens that Claire eats is 252 / 12 = 21 dozens.\n\nClaire will eat 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks."
