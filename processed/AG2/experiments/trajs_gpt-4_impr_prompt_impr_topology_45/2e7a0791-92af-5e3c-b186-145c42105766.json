He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and did 500 steps going shopping. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",

      "content": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Determine how many steps Elliott initially took by walking to and from school. Since this was half his daily goal, we know it's 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps.\n\nStep 2: Add the additional steps from his short walk with his friend to this total. That's 5,000 steps + 1,000 steps = 6,000 steps.\n\nStep 3: Add the steps Elliott took when he went shopping. So that's 6,000 steps + 500 steps = 6,500 steps.\n\nStep 4: Determine how many steps Elliott had left to take after his jog. Given that he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we subtract this from his daily goal of 10,000 steps to find the total number of steps he will take before his last 2,000 steps. That's 10,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 8,000 steps.\n\nStep 5: Now to find the number of steps taken during his jog, we subtract the total steps taken before his jog (from steps 1 to 3) from the total steps taken before his last 2,000 steps (from step 4). That would be 8,000 steps - 6,500 steps = 1,500 steps. \n\nSo, Elliott took 1,500 steps during his jog."
