      "content": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Determine the total amount of money Ali has. This is done by adding the amount of money from his $10 bills to the amount of money from his $20 bills. Hence four $10 bills sum to $40 and six $20 bills amount to $120. Adding these two amounts gives $160.\n\n2. Find the amount Ali gives to his sister. With the total money being $160, half of this total will be given to the sister, which results in Ali dividing the total $160 by 2, or $80.\n\n3. Determine the amount of money left with Ali after giving his sister $80. This is done by subtracting $80 from the total money of $160 to get $80.\n\n4. Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner. Given that Ali uses 3/5 of his remaining money to buy dinner, you find 3/5 of $80, which will be the cost of dinner. \n\n5. Finally, find out how much money Ali has left after buying dinner. This is done by subtracting the cost of dinner from the amount of money left after giving to his sister. \n\nFollowing these steps should solve the problem. This solution is independent of one provided by any other agents."

Ali then gave half of this, or $80, to his sister, leaving him with the same amount. He further used 3/5 of his remaining money or $48 on dinner. After that expenditure, he would have $32 left. This result was accurately computed by the python code from Agent Code Executor.\n\nTherefore, Ali has $32 left after buying dinner."
