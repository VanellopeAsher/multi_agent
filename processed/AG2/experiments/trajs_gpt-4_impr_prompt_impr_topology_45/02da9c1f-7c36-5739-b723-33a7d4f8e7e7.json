To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, one would simply divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts.\n\nLet's do this calculation now:\n\n\\[\\frac{Total\\ Ribbon\\ Length}{Total\\ Number\\ of\\ Gifts} = Ribbon\\ Per\\ Gift\\ Bow \\] \n\nUsing given values,\n\n\\[ \\frac{144\\ inches}{12\\ gifts} = ? \\] \n\nAgent Code Executor, could you please help us with this calculation? \n\nSuggested Next Speaker: Agent Code Executor."

So the length of ribbon she can use for each gift bow can be calculated by dividing the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts.\n\n```python\n# Total length of ribbon Monica has\ntotal_ribbon = 144 \n\n# Total number of gifts\ntotal_gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 \n\n# Length of ribbon she can use for each gift bow\nribbon_per_gift = total_ribbon / total_gifts\n\nprint(ribbon_per_gift)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code.\n\nSuggested Next Speaker: Agent Code Executor."
