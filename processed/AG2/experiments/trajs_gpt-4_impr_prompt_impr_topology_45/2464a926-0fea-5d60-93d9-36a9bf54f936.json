Then you need to subtract the number of balloons that were left at the end of the day. \n\nHere's how to arrive at the solution:\n\n    Step 1: Compute the total number of prepared balloons. You can do this by multiplying the number of sets (10) by the number of balloons in each set (30). \n    Step 2: Then, subtract the number of balloons left unused (12) from the total number of prepared balloons to get the number of used balloons.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail."

No assumptions have been made beyond the provided statements of the problem and both agents accounted for all information given in the problem statement (10 sets of balloons each containing 30 balloons, and 12 balloons remaining) in their calculations. Therefore, the final solution is **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{288}**. This means that Jolene and her friends used 288 balloons in their water balloon fight."
