      "content": "Let's assume that there were P packs of balloons. Since each pack contains 30 balloons, the total number of balloons would be P*30. Given, at the end of the game 12 balloons were left.\n\nSo to determine the number of balloons they threw, we need to subtract the number of remaining balloons from the total number of balloons.\n\nThe python code to solve for this would be as follows:\n\n```python\n# Initialize number of balloons per pack and remaining balloons\nballoons_per_pack = 30\nremaining_balloons = 12\n\n# Assume number of packs (P). This can be any number greater than zero\nnumber_of_packs = 3\n\n# Calculate total no of balloons \ntotal_balloons = number_of_packs * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Calculate thrown balloons\nthrown_balloons = total_balloons - remaining_balloons\n\n# print the result\nprint(thrown_balloons)\n```\n\nThis code will print the number of balloons that were thrown. It can be used regardless of the number of packs P, as long as P is greater than zero. Note that you can replace the value of number_of_packs with the actual number of packs used in the game. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor\n\nCan you try running this code?"

      "content": "The given solution appears to compute the thrown balloons correctly, provided that the number of packs is correctly defined. However, we are assuming the value of number_of_packs in the given Python code, which was not provided in the problem statement. This is an example of an assumed value, which we should avoid using in our final solution. Instead, we must always base our solution on the explicitly given variables. As such, given the absence of this crucial information in the problem statement, we cannot generate a final answer. \n\nIn conclusion, the solution to the problem cannot be determined with the given information, as the number of packs is not specified. Therefore, we cannot evaluate the solutions provided by Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}"
