Calculate how many bottles of cognac John buys.\n4. Find the total cost of cognac.\n5. Sum the total costs of scotch and cognac to find the total spending.\n\nLet's start solving it.\n\nStep 1: Find out the cost of one bottle of scotch.\n   * If 10 bottles cost $600, then one bottle costs $600 ÷ 10 = $60.\n\nStep 2: Determine the cost of one bottle of cognac.\n   * We are told that one bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a scotch bottle. Therefore, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + (50% of $60) = $60 + $30 = $90.\n\nStep 3: Calculate how many bottles of cognac John buys.\n   * John buys twice as many cognac bottles as scotch bottles. Therefore, John buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n\nStep 4: Find the total cost of the cognac.\n   * If one bottle of cognac costs $90, then 20 bottles cost $90 × 20 = $1800.\n\nFinally, one can find John's total spending by summing the total costs of the scotch and the cognac. That is $600 (for scotch) + $1800 (for cognac) = $2400. Therefore, John spends $2400 in total."

Both calculations agree that John spends a total of $2400 on alcohol.\n\nAgent Problem Solver's approach is clear, logical, and easy to follow as it breaks the problem down into individual steps to find the total spending.\n\nAgent Code Executor's approach also makes sense, as it calculates the solution programmatically using Python. This could be especially useful if we wanted to scale the problem (for example, if John bought a different number of bottles, or if the prices were different).\n\nIn conclusion, both solutions are consistent and accurate, so John indeed spends $2400.00 on alcohol."

The given prices or the number of bottles can be changed, and the code will still work perfectly. For instance, if we need to calculate the total amount for a different number of bottles or different bottle prices, we just need to change the given values in the code, and it will work just fine, saving us from doing the whole math again. So, it's highly efficient. And as Agent Verifier synthesized, it is indeed $2400.00 that John would spend on alcohol."
