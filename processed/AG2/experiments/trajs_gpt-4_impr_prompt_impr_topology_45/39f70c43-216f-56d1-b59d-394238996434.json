Calculate the total cost of the hamburgers by multiplying the cost of one hamburger by the number of hamburgers ordered, i.e., 5 * $4 = $20.\n\n2. Compute the total cost of the potato fries by finding the product of the cost of one pack of potato fries and the quantity ordered, i.e., 10 * $0.30 = $3.\n\n3. Since the price for the fruit drinks is not specified, we assume their cost is $0.\n\n4. Determine the total expense by adding the total cost of the hamburgers and potato fries, i.e., $20 + $3 = $23.\n\n5. Compute the change Carly gets back by subtracting the total cost from the money she paid, i.e., $50 - $23 = $27.\n\nSo Carly would get $27 change."

There is a subtle but important difference between how Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor approached this problem.\n\nAgent Problem Solver explained the problem in a very step-by-step manner, explicitly calculating the cost of each item, figuring out the total cost, and then using these to get the final answer. This is a very thorough and easy-to-follow approach that's ideal for anyone trying to understand the problem solving process.\n\nOn the other hand, Agent Code Executor, while still following the same steps, wrote code that can be easily adjusted to solve similar problems in the future. This reusable design is a cornerstone of efficient programming and an excellent trait for coders to possess. It also highlights the power of Python as a tool for solving mathematical problems.\n\nIn conclusion, Carly would get a change of $27 back if she gives a fifty-dollar bill.

By subtracting the son's age from the man's age, i.e., 24 - 3 = 21 years.\n\n2. We then understand that in X years, the man will be twice as old as his son. This implies the man's age in X years will be 24 + X and the son's age in X years will be 3 + X.\n\n3. Given the condition that in X years, the man is twice as old as his son, we form an equation: 24 + X = 2(3 + X).\n\n4. Solve this equation for X to find out how many years it will be until the man is twice as old as his son.\n   \n  Solving the equation gives:\n\n  24 + X = 2*3 + 2*X,\n  24 + X = 6 + 2X,\n  X = 24 - 6,\n  X = 18 years.\n\nSo it will be 18 years until the man is twice as old as his son."
