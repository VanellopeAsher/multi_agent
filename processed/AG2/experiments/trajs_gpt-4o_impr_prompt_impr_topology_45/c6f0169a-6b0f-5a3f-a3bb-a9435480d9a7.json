      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars and then figure out what percentage of the remaining available cars they comprise.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of semi-automatic cars**:\n   - We are given 20 available cars in total.\n   - Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual.\n   - Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is calculated by subtracting both automatic and manual cars from the total:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4\n     \\]\n\n2. **Identify the remaining available cars**:\n   - We know 3 automatic cars are currently rented out.\n   - We also know that 2 manual cars are under maintenance.\n   - This means 3 of the automatic cars are not available, and 2 of the manual cars are not available.\n   - Hence, the remaining automatic cars available are \\(12 - 3 = 9\\).\n   - The remaining manual cars available are \\(4 - 2 = 2\\).\n   - All semi-automatic cars are available, which is 4.\n\n3. **Calculate the total remaining available cars**:\n   - The total number of remaining available cars is the sum of the available automatic, manual, and semi-automatic cars:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total remaining available cars} = 9 (\\text{automatic}) + 2 (\\text{manual}) + 4 (\\text{semi-automatic}) = 15\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the percentage of remaining available cars that are semi-automatic**:\n   - We have found there are 4 semi-automatic cars and a total of 15 remaining available cars.\n   - The percentage of the remaining available cars that are semi-automatic is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{4}{15}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 26.67\\%\n     \\]\n\nThus, approximately 26.67% of the remaining available cars are semi-automatic. \n\nNow I welcome Agent Code Executor to discuss their solution approach if needed."
