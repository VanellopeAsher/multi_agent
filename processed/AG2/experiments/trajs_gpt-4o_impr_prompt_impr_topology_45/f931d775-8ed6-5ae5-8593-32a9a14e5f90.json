The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

This does not affect the calculation since it states that he needs to memorize 15 lines in this scene regardless.\n\n3. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize**:\n   - His lines in the solo song = 54\n   - His lines in the first scene = 36\n   - His required lines in the second scene = 15 (due to the absent actor)\n\nAdd them up to get the total number of lines:\n\\[\n\\text{Total lines Sean has to memorize} = 54 + 36 + 15 = 105\n\\]\n\nThus, Sean needs to memorize a total of 105 lines."
