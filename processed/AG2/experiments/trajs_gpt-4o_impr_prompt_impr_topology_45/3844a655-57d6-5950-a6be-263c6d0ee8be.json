While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends.

Subtract \\( 50x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 250x - 50x\n   \\]\n2. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   2000 = 200x\n   \\]\n3. Divide both sides by 200:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{2000}{200} = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to have the same cost. \n\nOnce other agents have provided their insights, I'll join the discussion for further analysis or adjustments if necessary."
