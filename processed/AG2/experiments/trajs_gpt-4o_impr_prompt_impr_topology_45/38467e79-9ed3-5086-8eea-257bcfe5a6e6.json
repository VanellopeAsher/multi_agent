      "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the relationship between fractions and the total number of students. Let's walk through the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Fraction**: We know that two-thirds of students have a desktop computer at home. This implies that the one-third of students do not have a desktop computer at home.\n\n2. **Relation with the 30 Students**: From the problem, 30 students do not have desktop computers. Since one-third of the students do not have desktop computers, we can establish that:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Total Students} = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the Total Number of Students**:\n\n   - Use the equation from the previous step:\n   \n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Total Students} = 30\n     \\]\n\n   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for the total number of students:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Students} = 30 \\times 3 = 90\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: There are a total of 90 students at that grade level.\n\nIn summary, when two-thirds of the students have desktop computers and 30 students do not, it means that the total number of students in that grade level is 90."

They both consistently calculated that the total number of students at the grade level is 90. \n\nThe logic involves recognizing that one-third of the students do not have desktop computers, and since 30 students do not have a desktop, we can calculate the total number of students by multiplying by 3, which would indeed give \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Total Students} = 30\\), meaning the total is \\(30 \\times 3 = 90\\).\n\nTherefore, I can confidently declare the solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{90}**"
