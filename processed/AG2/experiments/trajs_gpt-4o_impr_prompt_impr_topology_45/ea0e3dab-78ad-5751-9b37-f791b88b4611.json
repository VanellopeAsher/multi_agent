The solution provided is consistent and appears accurate, as both approaches reached the same conclusion. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n- For the first half of the year, Aleena pays \\(\\$200\\) per month for 6 months:\n  \\[\n  200 \\times 6 = 1200\n  \\]\n\n- For the second half of the year, Aleena is charged 15% less, making the monthly charge:\n  \\[\n  200 \\times (1 - 0.15) = 170\n  \\]\n  Then, she pays \\(\\$170\\) per month for 6 months:\n  \\[\n  170 \\times 6 = 1020\n  \\]\n\n- Total payment for the year is:\n  \\[\n  1200 + 1020 = 2220\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year is:\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2220}**"
