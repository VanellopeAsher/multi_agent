      "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Define the Known Variables**:\n   - The total area of the quilt is 101 square feet.\n   - Each small t-shirt contributes 3 square feet.\n   - Each medium t-shirt contributes 4 square feet.\n   - Each large t-shirt contributes 6 square feet.\n   - Octavia used 8 medium t-shirts.\n   - Octavia used 6 large t-shirts.\n\n2. **Calculate the Area Contributed by the Medium T-shirts**:\n   - Since a medium t-shirt contributes 4 square feet, the total area from medium t-shirts is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Medium Area} = 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Area Contributed by the Large T-shirts**:\n   - Since a large t-shirt contributes 6 square feet, the total area from large t-shirts is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Large Area} = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Remaining Area for the Small T-shirts**:\n   - The total area of the quilt is 101 square feet, so the remaining area for the small t-shirts is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining Area} = 101 - (\\text{Medium Area} + \\text{Large Area}) = 101 - (32 + 36) = 101 - 68 = 33 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Small T-shirts Used**:\n   - Since each small t-shirt contributes 3 square feet, the number of small t-shirts used is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of Small T-shirts} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining Area}}{3} = \\frac{33}{3} = 11\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Octavia used 11 small t-shirts to make the quilt.\n\nLet's discuss this approach."

They calculated the areas contributed by medium and large t-shirts and then determined how many small t-shirts were needed to complete the quilt's total area of 101 square feet.\n\nThe breakdown of the process is clear:\n- Medium t-shirts contribute 32 square feet.\n- Large t-shirts contribute 36 square feet.\n- The remaining 33 square feet must be covered by small t-shirts.\n- Since each small t-shirt covers 3 square feet, we need \\( \\frac{33}{3} = 11 \\) small t-shirts.\n\nThe verification of the calculation by executing code also supports these findings. Therefore, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{11}**"
