      "content": "To solve this problem, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Work**: First, calculate the total amount of work in terms of individual work-hours required to paint the entire house.\n   \n2. **Calculate Individual Work Rate**: Determine one person's work rate regarding how much of the house they can paint in an hour or a day.\n\n3. **Scale for Team of 5**: Extrapolate from the work rate of a single person to a team of five individuals working together.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Time Required**: Use the scaled team work rate to determine the total time required for the task.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Work**:\n   - If a single individual can paint half of a house in 5 days, it means that the entire house would take 10 days for one person to paint.\n   - Assuming an 8-hour workday, it requires \\(10 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 80 \\text{ work-hours}\\) for one person to completely paint one house.\n\n2. **Calculate Individual Work Rate**:\n   - One person paints half of the house in 5 days, which means they paint \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) house / 5 days = 0.1 house per day.\n   - In hours, this is \\(\\frac{0.1 \\text{ houses/day}}{8 \\text{ hours/day}} = 0.0125 \\text{ houses/hour}\\).\n\n3. **Scale for Team of 5**:\n   - If 5 individuals are working together, they collectively paint at a rate of \\(5 \\times 0.0125 \\text{ houses/hour} = 0.0625 \\text{ houses/hour}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Time Required**:\n   - To paint one house (1 house):\n   - \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{0.0625 \\text{ houses/hour}} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\nThus, it will take a team of 5 individuals 16 hours in total to paint the entire house."
