  "problem": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $120 and each pair of shoes cost $100. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, I'll calculate the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes, determine the amount of money Sara currently has, and then find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Jacket and Shoes**:\n   - Cost of the jacket: $120\n   - Cost of each pair of shoes: $100\n   - Total cost of 2 pairs of shoes: \n     \\[\n     2 \\times 100 = 200\n     \\]\n   - Total cost for the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes:\n     \\[\n     120 + 200 = 320\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Sara's Current Savings**:\n   - Amount saved before babysitting: $100\n   - Earnings from babysitting 10 times at $5 each:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 5 = 50\n     \\]\n   - Total savings before mowing:\n     \\[\n     100 + 50 = 150\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Additional Money Needed**:\n   - Total money needed to buy the jacket and shoes:\n     \\[\n     320\n     \\]\n   - Money currently available:\n     \\[\n     150\n     \\]\n   - Additional money needed:\n     \\[\n     320 - 150 = 170\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Times Sara Needs to Mow the Lawn**:\n   - Payment per lawn mowing: $10\n   - Times needed to mow the lawn to earn an extra $170:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{170}{10} = 17\n     \\]\n\nSara needs to mow the lawn **17 times** in order to afford the jacket and shoes."
