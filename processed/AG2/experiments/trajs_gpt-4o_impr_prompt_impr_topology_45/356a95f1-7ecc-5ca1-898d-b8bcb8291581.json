      "content": "To solve this problem, we will establish variables for the fence lengths distributed to Sam and Harry. Let's define:\n\n- \\( S \\) as the feet of fence Sam receives.\n- \\( H \\) as the feet of fence Harry receives.\n\nWe are informed about two main conditions:\n\n1. The total length of the fence is 200 feet.\n2. Harry gets 80 feet more of the fence than Sam.\n\nNow, let's set up the equations based on these conditions:\n\n1. \\( S + H = 200 \\)\n2. \\( H = S + 80 \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first to find the value of \\( S \\):\n\n\\[ S + (S + 80) = 200 \\]\n\n\\[ 2S + 80 = 200 \\]\n\nSubtract 80 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2S = 120 \\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[ S = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sam gets 60 feet of fence. Harry, based on our equation \\( H = S + 80 \\), will get:\n\n\\[ H = 60 + 80 = 140 \\]\n\nThis checks out with the total:\n\\[ 60 + 140 = 200 \\]\n\nThus, Sam receives 60 feet of the fence."
