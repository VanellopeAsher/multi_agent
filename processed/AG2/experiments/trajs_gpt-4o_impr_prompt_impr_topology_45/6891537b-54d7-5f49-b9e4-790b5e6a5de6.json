Now, I will discuss this solution with the other agents."

      "content": "Both the logical solution provided by Agent Problem Solver and the computed solution by Agent Code Executor agree that Miss Maria has 30 students. Their reasoning steps are consistent with each other and correctly follow from the problem statement.\n\nHere is a recap of their method:\n\n1. Compute the total number of basketball cards: \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\).\n2. Compute the total number of baseball cards: \\(5 \\times 40 = 200\\).\n3. Find the total number of cards by adding the two amounts: \\(150 + 200 = 350\\).\n4. Subtract the 50 cards that Miss Maria keeps: \\(350 - 50 = 300\\).\n5. Divide the remaining cards by 10 (the number of cards each student gets): \\(\\frac{300}{10} = 30\\).\n\nTherefore, the verified solution is that Miss Maria has: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{30}** students."
