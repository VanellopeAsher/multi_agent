In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To find out how much Walter's friend donated, let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Initial Donation**: \n   - Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund.\n   - Total initial donation = $500 + $1500 = $2000.\n\n2. **Lawyer's Contribution**: \n   - The lawyer agrees to donate three times the amount donated by everyone else.\n   - If the total donation from Walter's neighbors and the online fund is $2000, the lawyer will donate 3 times $2000.\n   - Lawyer's donation = $2000 * 3 = $6000.\n\n3. **Lawyer's Total Contribution**:\n   - According to the problem, the lawyer contributes $6600 in total.\n   - We need to account for any additional contributions not covered by the initial $6000 from the calculation.\n\n4. **Calculate the Friend's Donation**:\n   - The lawyer's total contribution is comprised of his 3x donation and the amount donated by Walter's friend.\n   - If the lawyer's contribution is $6600, which includes both his $6000 donation and the amount from the friend, then:\n   - $6600 - $6000 = $600.\n\nTherefore, Walter's friend donated $600. \n\nIs there any part you would like me to clarify further, or shall we proceed to discuss this solution with the team?"

Let's go over the calculations to confirm this:\n\n1. **Total Initial Donation**: Walter collected $500 from neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, totaling $2000.\n\n2. **Lawyer's Contribution**: He donates three times the amount collected by Walter ($2000), which equals $6000.\n\n3. **Total Lawyer Contribution**: The problem states the lawyer contributed $6600 in total.\n\n4. **Friend's Donation**: Since the lawyer's total contribution is $6600, and $6000 was solely his multiple donation, the remainder $6600 - $6000 = $600 is from the friend.\n\nEverything aligns with the solutions provided.
