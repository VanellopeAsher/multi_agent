Ava gives Jayden half of her $90 allowance. Hence, she gives him 90 / 2 = $45.\n3. In total, Jayden currently has $70 + $45 = $115.\n4. Jayden needs an additional $85 on top of what he already has.\n\nSo, the cost of the camera is the sum of the money Jayden has and what he still needs:\n\n\\[ 115 + 85 = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the camera costs $200."
