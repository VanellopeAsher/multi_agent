Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Determine Charmaine's Current Age**:\n   - We know that Charmaine will turn 16 in 12 years.\n   - Therefore, her age in 12 years will be 16.\n   - To find her current age, we need to subtract 12 from 16.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Age} = 16 - 12 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.\n\n2. **Calculate Charmaine's Age in 4 Years**:\n   - To find Charmaine's age after 4 years, we need to add 4 years to her current age.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age in 4 Years} = 4 + 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old in 4 years.\n\nNow, let's discuss the solution to ensure it's correct and clear."

Adding 4 to find her age in 4 years resulted in an answer of 8.\n\nThe Agent Code Executor executed a code snippet to compute Charmaine's age in 4 years following the same logic, which also produced an age of 8.\n\nThe solutions from both agents are consistent and correct based on the given information:\n\n- Charmaine's future age is determined as 16 years in 12 years.\n- Her current age is calculated as 4 years.\n- Her age after 4 years is verified to be 8 years.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{8}**"
