In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Let's approach the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Cost Price Including Transportation**:  \n   The cost price for the trader for each bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost.  \n   - Cost of the bag = $20\n   - Transportation cost per bag = $2  \n   So, the total cost per bag = $20 + $2 = $22\n\n2. **Determine the Selling Price**:  \n   The trader sells each bag for $30.\n\n3. **Calculate the Profit per Bag**:  \n   Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price  \n   Profit per bag = $30 - $22 = $8\n\n4. **Find the Total Number of Bags Sold (Let's denote it by 'x')**:  \n   The total profit made by the trader is $400.  \n   So, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   8x = 400\n   \\]\n   Solving this equation for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{400}{8} = 50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.\n\nLet's discuss our findings and conclusions with other agents before finalizing the solution."
