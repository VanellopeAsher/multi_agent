Thus, Reggie ran:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Lynn's miles**: Unfortunately, there's no further direct information given about how many miles Lynn ran. The problem must provide explicit data regarding how much Lynn ran or mention any relative comparisons. As it stands, the information provided does not include data on Lynn's running distance.\n\nWithout additional context or information, it's impossible to specify precisely how many miles Lynn ran. We may need to clarify the problem statement or inquire if an additional part or condition is missing."

Perhaps if there's more context or details, such as a total collective distance they ran together or a specific relationship between Lynn's running and the others, we could derive that figure.
