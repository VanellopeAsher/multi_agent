Let's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Calculating the total number of plants:**\n   - For 50 baskets, we need 1,500 petunias (30 per basket) and 1,000 sweet potato vines (20 per basket).\n\n2. **Calculating the cost:**\n   - The cost for 1,500 petunias at $3.00 each is $4,500.\n   - The cost for 1,000 vines at $2.50 each is $2,500.\n\n3. **Adding up the total costs:**\n   - The total cost for filling all the baskets is $4,500 (petunias) + $2,500 (vines) = $7,000.\n\nBoth the problem-solving steps and the executed code confirm this calculation.
