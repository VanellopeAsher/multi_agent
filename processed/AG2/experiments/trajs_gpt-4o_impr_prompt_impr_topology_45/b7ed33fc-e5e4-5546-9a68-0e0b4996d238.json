      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time John spends solving both normal and extreme sudoku puzzles and calculate how many bottles of water he drinks during that period.\n\n1. **Determine Time for Normal Sudoku**:  \n   John spends 30 minutes solving a normal sudoku puzzle. As the problem states, he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes).\n\n2. **Determine Time for Extreme Sudoku**:  \n   An extreme sudoku takes him 3 times the duration of a normal one. Since a normal sudoku takes 30 minutes, an extreme sudoku will take John \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) minutes.\n\n3. **Total Time for Both Puzzles**:  \n   We sum the time spent on both types of sudoku puzzles:\n   - Normal sudoku: 30 minutes\n   - Extreme sudoku: 90 minutes\n   \\(\\text{Total time} = 30 + 90 = 120 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Bottles of Water**:  \n   Since John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, we can determine the number of bottles he drinks by dividing the total time by his drinking interval:\n   \\(\\text{Bottles of water} = \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{30 \\text{ minutes per bottle}} = 4\\).\n\nThus, John drinks 4 bottles of water during the time it takes to solve both types of sudoku puzzles. \n\nLet me know if this reasoning aligns with your understanding or if there's anything you'd like me to clarify further!"

The calculations correctly determine that John drinks 4 bottles of water during the entire 120 minutes spent solving both types of puzzles.\n\nTherefore, the verified solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{4}**"
