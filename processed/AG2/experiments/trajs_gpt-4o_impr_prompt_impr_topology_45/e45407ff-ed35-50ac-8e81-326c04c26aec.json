      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Cost of a Single Bottle of Scotch:**\n   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600.\n   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch = Total Cost of Scotch / Number of Bottles of Scotch  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \\frac{600}{10} = 60 \n     \\]\n   - So, each bottle of scotch costs $60.\n\n2. **Cost of a Single Bottle of Cognac:**\n   - Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than each bottle of scotch.\n   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch + 50% of Cost per bottle of scotch  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.50 \\times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \n     \\]\n   - So, each bottle of cognac costs $90.\n\n3. **Number of Bottles of Cognac:**\n   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch.\n   - Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n\n4. **Total Cost of Cognac:**\n   - Total cost of 20 bottles of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac × Cost per bottle of cognac  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \\times 90 = 1800 \n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Expenditure:**\n   - Total cost on both drinks = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total expenditure} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \n     \\]\n\nTherefore, John spends a total of $2400 on buying scotch and cognac."
