      "content": "To find out how many people Billy helps per hour, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Days Between March 1st and April 19th:**\n   - March has 31 days, and April has 19 days up to April 19th.\n   - Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days Billy Takes Off:**\n   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.\n   - Number of days off = 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days He Works:**\n   - Total working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Hours Billy Works:**\n   - Billy works 3 hours each day.\n   - Total hours worked = 3 hours/day * 40 days = 120 hours.\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of People He Helps Per Hour:**\n   - Billy helps 240 people in total.\n   - Therefore, the number of people he helps per hour = 240 people / 120 hours = 2 people per hour.\n\nHence, Billy helps 2 people per hour."

Calculating the total number of relevant days: 50 days (\\(31 + 19\\)).\n2. Determining the days he takes off: 10 days (\\(0.2 \\times 50\\)).\n3. Calculating days Billy works: 40 days (\\(50 - 10\\)).\n4. Determining the total hours worked: 120 hours (\\(40 \\times 3\\)).\n5. Finally, calculating the number of people helped per hour: 2 people/hour (\\(240/120\\)).\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed that Billy helps:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2}**"
