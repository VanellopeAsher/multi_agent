In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Therefore, the total cost of the vaccines is:  \n   \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Broken Vases Cost**: The kitten broke 3 vases, each costing $15. Therefore, the total cost of the broken vases is:  \n   \\(3 \\times 15 = 45\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Neutering Cost} + \\text{Vaccine Costs} + \\text{Broken Vases Cost} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 150 + 60 + 45 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 255 \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the kitten so far is $255."
