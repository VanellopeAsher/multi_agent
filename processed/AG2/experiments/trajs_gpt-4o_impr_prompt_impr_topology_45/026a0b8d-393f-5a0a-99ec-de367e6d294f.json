She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

      "content": "To solve this math problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify what we know:**\n   - The cost of one packet of tomato seeds is $40.\n   - The cost of one packet of celery seeds is $30.\n   - Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n   - The total amount spent on seeds is $3200.\n\n2. **Establish an equation:** \n   Let \\( x \\) represent the number of tomato seed packets. The total cost of the tomato seed packets is \\( 40x \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the celery seed packets:** \n   Since one packet of celery seeds costs $30, for 80 packets, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   80 \\times 30 = 2400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express the total cost equation:**\n   Since the total expenditure on the seeds is $3200:\n   \\[\n   40x + 2400 = 3200\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Subtract the cost of celery seeds from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   40x = 3200 - 2400 \\\\\n   40x = 800\n   \\]\n\n   Divide both sides by 40 to find the number of tomato packets:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{800}{40} \\\\\n   x = 20\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.\n\nNow, let's discuss this solution. Let me know if you have any feedback or different approaches!"
