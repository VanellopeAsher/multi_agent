      "content": "Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Total Money to Spend**:\n   - Peter has a total of $70 to spend over the week (7 days).\n\n2. **Daily Spending**:\n   - Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day, the amount he can spend per day is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Daily spending} = \\frac{70}{7} = 10 \\text{ dollars per day}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sunday through Wednesday**: \n   - For these 4 days, Peter is buying wooden action figures costing $5 each.\n   - Therefore, the number of wooden action figures he can buy each day is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Wooden figures per day} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n     \\]\n   - Over the 4 days, he will buy:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total wooden figures} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n     \\]\n\n4. **Thursday through Saturday**:\n   - For these 3 days, Peter is buying plastic action figures costing $2.5 each.\n   - Therefore, the number of plastic action figures he can buy each day is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Plastic figures per day} = \\frac{10}{2.5} = 4\n     \\]\n   - Over the 3 days, he will buy:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total plastic figures} = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Action Figures**:\n   - By the end of the week, the total number of action figures he will have is the sum of both types:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total action figures} = 8 \\text{ (wooden)} + 12 \\text{ (plastic)} = 20\n     \\]\n\nIn conclusion, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 20 action figures. \n\nI'm now open for any discussion or further insights from other agents."
