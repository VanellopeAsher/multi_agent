  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Weight:**\n   - **Sugar Cubes:** Two 1-pound boxes.\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 1 = 2 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Carrots:** Four 12-pound bags.\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Hay:** Forty-two 75-pound bales.\n     \\[\n     42 \\times 75 = 3150 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Oats:** Twenty 65-pound sacks.\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 65 = 1300 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:**\n   \\[\n   2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the carrying capacity of the truck per trip if the total weight is to be divided into two trips:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4500}{2} = 2250 \\text{ pounds per trip}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the farm truck must be capable of carrying 2250 pounds at a time to transport all the feed in two trips."
