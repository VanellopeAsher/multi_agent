That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",

      "content": "Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the dental work.\n\n- **Base price for 2 implants:** Each implant costs $2000.5.  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost for 2 implants} = 2 \\times 2000.5 = 4001\n  \\]\n\n- **Additional cost for a porcelain crown:** One crown costs an extra $500.5.  \n  Add this to the cost of the implants:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total cost} = 4001 + 500.5 = 4501.5\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Subtract the deposit.\n\nGeorge has already put down a deposit of $600.\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining amount to be paid} = 4501.5 - 600 = 3901.5\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of hours George needs to work.\n\nGeorge earns $15.3 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to make $3901.5, we divide the remaining cost by his hourly wage:\n\\[\n\\text{Hours needed} = \\frac{3901.5}{15.3} \\approx 254.29\n\\]\n\nTherefore, George needs to work approximately 254.29 hours. Since he can't work a fraction of an hour, he'll need to work 255 hours to have enough to pay for the dental work.\n\nLet's discuss any concerns or alternative approaches before finalizing this solution."
