According to the ratio of their ages 7:11, we can express the ages as:\n- \\( D = 7x \\)\n- \\( A = 11x \\)\n\n**Step 2: Use the sum of their ages to find the value of \\( x \\).**\n\nThe problem states that their total age is 162:\n\\[ D + A = 162 \\]\n\\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \\]\n\\[ 18x = 162 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\).**\n\nDivide both sides by 18 to find \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{162}{18} \\]\n\\[ x = 9 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate their current ages using \\( x \\).**\n\nNow that we have \\( x = 9 \\):\n- Darrell's age \\( D = 7x = 7 \\times 9 = 63 \\)\n- Allen's age \\( A = 11x = 11 \\times 9 = 99 \\)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.**\n\nAllen's current age is 99, so 10 years from now:\n\\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \\]\n\nTherefore, Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years."
