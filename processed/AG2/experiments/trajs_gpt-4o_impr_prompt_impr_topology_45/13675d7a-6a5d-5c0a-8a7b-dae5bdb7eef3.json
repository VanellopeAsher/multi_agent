      "content": "To determine how many wheels were initially in the box, we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Wheels Needed:**\n   - Each car requires 4 wheels and Henry needs to assemble 57 cars. Therefore, the total wheels needed for cars are:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 57 = 228 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels and Henry needs to assemble 73 motorcycles. Therefore, the total wheels needed for motorcycles are:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 73 = 146 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n   - Adding both together, the total number of wheels required to assemble all toys is:\n     \\[\n     228 + 146 = 374 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Initial Number of Wheels:**\n   - After using the necessary wheels to assemble all the toys, there are 276 wheels left in the box.\n   - If \\( x \\) represents the initial number of wheels in the box, then:\n     \\[\n     x - 374 = 276\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Add 374 to both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     x = 276 + 374 = 650\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, initially, there were 650 wheels in the box. \n\nIn conclusion, the number of wheels initially in the box is \\( 650 \\). \n\nI will now join the discussion with other agents to verify this solution and ensure all perspectives are considered."
