Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

      "content": "To find out how many times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees, we need to analyze and break down the information given in the problem.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding Joanne's Apple Gathering:**\n   - Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees.\n   - Joanne gathered half of this amount from the shortest trees, which is \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\) apples.\n   - Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.\n\n2. **Adding Up Joanne's Total:**\n   - Total apples gathered by Joanne:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ (tallest)} + 15 \\text{ (shortest)} + 350 \\text{ (average)} = 395 \\text{ apples}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating Total Apples Gathered by Her Sister:**\n   - Together they gathered 500 apples in total.\n   - Therefore, her sister gathered:\n     \\[\n     500 \\text{ (total)} - 395 \\text{ (Joanne)} = 105 \\text{ apples}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Understanding Her Sister’s Apple Gathering:**\n   - Her sister gathered twice as many apples as Joanne from the tallest trees:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ apples}\n     \\]\n   - Let the number of apples her sister gathered from the shortest trees be \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Total Apples Gathered by Her Sister:**\n   - Her sister gathered only from the tallest and shortest trees. Knowing her total:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ (tallest)} + x \\text{ (shortest)} = 105\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 105 - 60 = 45 \\text{ apples}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Comparing the Shortest Trees Apple Gathering:**\n   - Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees.\n   - Her sister gathered 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n   - Therefore, her sister gathered:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{45 \\text{ (sister)}}{15 \\text{ (Joanne)}} = 3 \\text{ times as many apples}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Joanne's sister gathered 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees."
