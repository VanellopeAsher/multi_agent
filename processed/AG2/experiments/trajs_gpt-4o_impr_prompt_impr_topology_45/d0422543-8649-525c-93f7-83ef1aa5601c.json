      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first define the relationship between Carver and his son's age using an equation based on the given information.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We know that Carver's age is 60 and he is 8 years less than twice the age of his son.\n\n2. **Define the Variables**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the age of Carver's son.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**: \n   - According to the problem, Carver's age (60) is 8 years less than twice his son's age. This can be mathematically expressed as:\n     \\[\n     60 = 2x - 8\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equation**:\n   - First, add 8 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing \\( x \\) on one side:\n     \\[\n     60 + 8 = 2x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     68 = 2x\n     \\]\n   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{68}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 34\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solution**: Carver's son is 34 years old.\n\nI will now discuss the solution with my teammates to ensure accuracy and completeness."
