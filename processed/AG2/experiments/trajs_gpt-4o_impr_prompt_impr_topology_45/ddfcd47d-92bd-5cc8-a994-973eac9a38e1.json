Finally, we'll calculate how much each person will get if the total amount is shared equally.\n\n1. **Determine Kassidy's Money**:\n   - Aurelia has $150.\n   - Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = 100\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Determine Rayna's Money**:\n   - Rayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy.\n   - Kassidy has $100, so Rayna has \\(100 + 70 = 170\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Money**:\n   - Add up the amount of money each person has:\n     - Aurelia: $150\n     - Kassidy: $100\n     - Rayna: $170\n   - Total: \\(150 + 100 + 170 = 420\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Share Equally Among Them**:\n   - Since there are 3 people and they want to share the total money equally, each will get:\n     - Total money to share = $420\n     - Each will get: \\(\\frac{420}{3} = 140\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, if they decide to add together their money and share equally among them, each person would get $140."
