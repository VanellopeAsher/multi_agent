The final length of the ribbon before any cuts is calculated correctly by considering the cascading segments from the smallest (5 cm) back to the full ribbon length.\n\nThe logic employed:\n- From the smallest unit of 5 cm, each initial part was derived by multiplying by 5.\n- The whole ribbon's length was determined by multiplying these larger initial sections by 4.\n\nThus, the total original length of the ribbon is determined accurately.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{100}**"
