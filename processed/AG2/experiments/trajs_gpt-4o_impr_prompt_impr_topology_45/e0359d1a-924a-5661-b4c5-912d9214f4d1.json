In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to find out the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have together, and then divide it equally among the three of them.\n\nHere are the steps for the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Amount of Candy:**\n   - Robert has 3 pounds of candy.\n   - Cindy has 5 pounds of candy.\n   - Aaron has 4 pounds of candy.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of candy = \\(3 + 5 + 4\\) pounds.\n\n2. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - Add the individual amounts of candy: \\(3 + 5 + 4 = 12\\) pounds.\n\n3. **Divide the Total Equally Among the Three People:**\n   - Total amount of candy = 12 pounds.\n   - Number of people sharing the candy = 3.\n\n4. **Calculate the Amount of Candy per Person:**\n   - Each person gets \\( \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\) pounds of candy.\n\nThus, each of Robert, Cindy, and Aaron will have 4 pounds of candy after pooling and sharing equally. \n\nNow, I'd like to engage in discussion with the team to ensure we're all aligned on this solution."
