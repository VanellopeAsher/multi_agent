If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days, how many people does he help? After helping people, Billy also decides to take a 15-minute break every hour to drink a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine. He also spends 30 minutes each day to organize his paperwork.  (Remember there are 31 days in March.)",

Letâ€™s go step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**\n\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 19th is 19 days into April.\n   - Total days: \\( 31 + 19 = 50 \\) days.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of days Billy takes off.**\n\n   He takes 20% of the days off.\n\n   - Days off: \\( 20\\% \\text{ of } 50 \\text{ days} = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ days} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days Billy works.**\n\n   - Working days: \\( 50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ days} \\).\n\n4. **Determine how many people Billy can help per day.**\n\n   - He helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.\n   - People helped per day: \\( 2 \\text{ people/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ people/day} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of people Billy helps over the working period.**\n\n   - Total people helped: \\( 6 \\text{ people/day} \\times 40 \\text{ days} = 240 \\text{ people} \\).\n\n**Conclusion: Billy helps 240 people.**\n\nThe details about taking breaks and organizing paperwork do not affect the number of people he helps, as they occur outside of his specific helping hours. However, they might be interesting for understanding his daily schedule more comprehensively, but I believe they do not directly impact the calculation for how many people he helps. \n\nLet me know if there is anything else that needs clarification or further discussion on this!"
