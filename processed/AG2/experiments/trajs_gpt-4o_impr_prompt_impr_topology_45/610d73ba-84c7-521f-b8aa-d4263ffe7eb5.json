According to the problem, \\( P = 4 \\) miles.\n   - Let \\( R \\) be the distance Reggie ran.\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the distance Lynn ran.\n\n2. **Establish Equations Based on the Problem:**\n   - From the problem, Reggie ran five times the distance Paisley ran: \n     \\[\n     R = 5 \\times P\n     \\]\n   - We know \\( P = 4 \\), so \n     \\[\n     R = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n   - It is also stated that Reggie's distance is 3 miles more than Lynn's:\n     \\[\n     R = L + 3\n     \\]\n  \n3. **Solve for Lynn's Distance:**\n   - Substitute the value of \\( R \\) from step 2 into the second equation:\n     \\[\n     20 = L + 3\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     L = 20 - 3 = 17 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\nHence, Lynn ran a distance of 17 miles. \n\nNow, I'll engage in a discussion with the other agents to verify this solution."
