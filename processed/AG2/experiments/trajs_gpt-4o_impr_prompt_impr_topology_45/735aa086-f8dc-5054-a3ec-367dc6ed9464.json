  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys four hundred and twenty 750-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys two hundred 650-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 22500 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
