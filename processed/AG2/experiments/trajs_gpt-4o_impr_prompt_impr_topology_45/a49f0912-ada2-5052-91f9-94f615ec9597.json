      "content": "To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to break down the information given and calculate based on the percentages.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Time Spent Watching Shows**:\n   - He watched 30 different shows, each 20 hours long.\n   - Total time spent watching shows = 30 shows * 20 hours/show = 600 hours.\n\n2. **Determine the Total Amount of Time Based on Show Watching**:\n   - We know that watching shows took up 30% of his total time.\n   - Let \\( T \\) be his total vacation time. Then, 30% of \\( T \\) is equal to 600 hours.\n   - \\( 0.30T = 600 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for Total Time \\( T \\)**:\n   - \\( T = \\frac{600}{0.30} = 2000 \\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate Time Spent Sightseeing**:\n   - Sightseeing took up 40% of his time.\n   - Therefore, time spent sightseeing = 40% of his total time.\n   - Time spent sightseeing = \\( 0.40 \\times 2000 = 800 \\) hours.\n\nThus, John spent 800 hours sightseeing during his vacation. Now, I will discuss the solution with my teammates."
