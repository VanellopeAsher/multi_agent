Since they make the same amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, the total for these two days would be \\( x + x = 2x \\).\n\nOn Friday, they make twice the amount that they make on Tuesday (or Wednesday), which is \\( 2x \\) as well.\n\nThe equation representing the total number of chimichangas made over these three days is:\n\n\\[\n2x + 2x = 500\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n4x = 500\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday (and Wednesday), divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n\\]\n\nTherefore, they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday."
