Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

      "content": "To determine how much Jessica pays on her debts in a year when paying 50% more than the minimum required payments, we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Minimum Debt Payments**:\n   - Student Loans: $300/month\n   - Credit Card: $200/month\n   - Mortgage: $500/month\n\n2. **Calculate 50% More Than Minimum**:\n   - For each debt, calculate the amount that is 50% more than the minimum.\n   - Student Loans: \\( 300 + 0.5 \\times 300 = 450 \\)\n   - Credit Card: \\( 200 + 0.5 \\times 200 = 300 \\)\n   - Mortgage: \\( 500 + 0.5 \\times 500 = 750 \\)\n\n3. **Sum the Monthly Debt Payments**:\n   - Total monthly debt payment = $450 (Student Loans) + $300 (Credit Card) + $750 (Mortgage)\n   - Total monthly debt payment = $1,500\n\n4. **Calculate Annual Debt Payments**:\n   - Annual payment on debts = $1,500/month Ã— 12 months/year\n   - Annual payment on debts = $18,000\n\nJessica's annual payment for her debts, considering she pays 50% more than the minimum on each debt, is $18,000. She pays the regular amounts for her gym and Netflix, but the question specifically asks about her debt payments, not her total expenses including subscriptions. Therefore, the answer focuses on debts only."

They calculated the amount Jessica pays annually on her debts, considering she pays 50% more than the minimum payments.
