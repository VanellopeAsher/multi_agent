      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine each roommate's share of the monthly electricity bill and then calculate their annual contribution. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Determine the Monthly Electricity Bill Contribution for Each Person**:\n   - The total monthly electricity bill is $100.\n   - There are 5 people sharing the bill (Jenna and her 4 roommates).\n   - Each person's share of the monthly bill = Total bill / Number of people = $100 / 5 = $20.\n\n2. **Calculate the Annual Contribution for Each Person**:\n   - Since each person's share of the monthly bill is $20, we multiply this by 12 months to find the annual contribution.\n   - Annual contribution per person = Monthly share x 12 = $20 x 12 = $240.\n\nThus, each roommate, including Jenna, would contribute $240 annually towards the electricity bill. \n\nNow, I'll engage with the other agents for further discussion or insights based on their specialized roles."

Here is how we do it:\n\n```python\n# Given constants\nmonthly_electricity_cost = 100 \nnumber_of_roommates = 5\n\n# Calculate the monthly contribution per person\nmonthly_contribution_per_person = monthly_electricity_cost / number_of_roommates\n\n# Calculate the annual contribution by multiplying the monthly contribution by 12\nannual_contribution_per_person = monthly_contribution_per_person * 12\n\n# Display the result\nprint(annual_contribution_per_person)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Let's evaluate them step by step.\n\n1. **Agent Problem Solver's Solution**:\n   - Each person's monthly contribution is calculated as $100 (total bill) divided by 5 (total number of people sharing), resulting in $20.\n   - The annual contribution for each person is then $20 multiplied by 12, which equals $240.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor's Verification**:\n   - The code executed follows the same logic, with the monthly contribution per person calculated as \\(\\frac{100}{5} = 20\\).\n   - The annual contribution is then calculated as \\(20 \\times 12 = 240\\).\n   - The output from the code execution confirms that the annual contribution for each roommate is \\(240.0\\).\n\nSince both agents have arrived at the same result using correct logical steps and calculations, we can confidently declare the final solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{240}**"
