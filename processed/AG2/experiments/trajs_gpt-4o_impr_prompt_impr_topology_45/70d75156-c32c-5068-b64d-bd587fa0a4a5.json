      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Boxes Bought:**\n   - Let the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought be \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Oranges Given Away:**\n   - Mrs. Harrington gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. In total, she gave away \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) boxes.\n\n3. **Boxes Remaining After Giving Away:**\n   - After giving away 4 boxes, the remaining number of boxes is \\( x - 4 \\).\n\n4. **Convert the Remaining Boxes to Oranges:**\n   - Each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges in the remaining boxes is \\( 20 \\times (x - 4) \\).\n\n5. **Oranges Kept by Mrs. Harrington:**\n   - Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of these remaining oranges. Hence, the number of oranges she kept is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 \\times (x - 4) = 5 \\times (x - 4) \\).\n\n6. **Oranges Sold by Mrs. Harrington:**\n   - Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, she sold the remaining 3/4. Therefore, the number of oranges sold is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 \\times (x - 4) = 15 \\times (x - 4) \\).\n\n7. **Need Additional Information to Finalize Calculation:**\n    - We need the value of \\( x \\) (total number of boxes bought) to calculate the exact number of oranges sold.\n\nSo, Mrs. Harrington sold \\( 15 \\times (x - 4) \\) oranges. To provide an exact number, the total number of boxes \\( x \\) bought initially would need to be specified. Let me know if there is any additional information or constraints related to the value of \\( x \\)."

This confirms our earlier analysis.\n\nHere's a recap of the solution:\n\n1. Mrs. Harrington bought a total of \\( x \\) boxes.\n2. Each box contained 20 oranges.\n3. She gave away 4 boxes, leaving her with \\( x - 4 \\) boxes.\n4. Of these remaining boxes, she kept 1/4 of the oranges and thus sold 3/4.\n5. The formula \\( 15x - 60 \\) tells us how many oranges she ended up selling, where \\( x \\) is the total number of boxes.\n\nUntil we have the specific total number of boxes \\( x \\) bought, the number of oranges sold can only be represented in terms of this formula.\n\nIs there additional information available regarding the number of boxes bought, or should we consider possible scenarios based on potential values of \\( x \\)?"

Both solutions successfully demonstrate that the number of oranges sold is based on the expression \\( 15x - 60 \\).\n\nGiven that no specific value for \\( x \\) was provided, the problem remains unsolvable in terms of yielding an actual number for the oranges sold. Therefore, in accordance with the solution requirement, I must declare the absence of a definitive solution due to missing initial conditions.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
