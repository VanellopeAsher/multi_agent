Kelly has:\n   - 5 quarters, valued at 25 cents each, which totals 5 * 25 = 125 cents.\n   - 2 dimes, valued at 10 cents each, which totals 2 * 10 = 20 cents.\n\n2. Therefore, the total amount of money Kelly has is:\n   - 125 + 20 = 145 cents.\n\n3. The total cost of the can of pop and the candy bar is:\n   - 55 cents + 45 cents = 100 cents.\n\n4. The amount of money left after the purchases is:\n   - 145 - 100 = 45 cents.\n\nBoth approaches have arrived at the same correct result. Therefore, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{45}**"
