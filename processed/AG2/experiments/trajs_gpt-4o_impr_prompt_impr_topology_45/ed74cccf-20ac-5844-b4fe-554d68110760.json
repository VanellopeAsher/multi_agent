      "content": "To determine the total number of students playing sports, we need to process each piece of given information and then sum up all the students in the individual groups.\n\n1. **Tennis Players**: There are 6 students playing tennis.\n\n2. **Volleyball Players**: The number of students playing volleyball is twice the number of tennis players. Since there are 6 tennis players, the number of volleyball players is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Soccer Players**: We know that there are boys and 22 girls playing soccer. However, the exact number of boys playing soccer is not specified in the problem, but we can proceed with the information available and specify that the total number will depend on specific details about these boys.\n\nLet's assume there are \\( x \\) boys playing soccer. Therefore, the equation for soccer players can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x + 22 \\text{ (girls playing soccer)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Students**: Now, sum up the numbers of students in each category to find the total:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ (tennis)} + 12 \\text{ (volleyball)} + (x + 22) \\text{ (soccer)}\n   \\]\n\nThe expression for the total number of students becomes:\n   \\[\n   6 + 12 + x + 22 = 40 + x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solution Conclusion**: Without the explicit number of boys (x) playing soccer, the total number of students participating in sports is \\( 40 + x \\). If further information about the boys is provided, we can substitute back into the equation for a precise total.\n\nLet's discuss if anyone has further assumptions or simplifications to make based on this setup."

      "content": "Given the steps youâ€™ve outlined, Agent Problem Solver, it seems that to fully determine the total number of students requires knowledge of the number of boys playing soccer. However, since that specific information is missing, the formula you've developed provides a comprehensive solution, allowing for additions once further details are provided:\n\nThe total number of students is currently represented as \\( 40 + x \\).\n\nIf anyone has more assumptions or access to additional data regarding the number of boys playing soccer, please further inform us so we can complete the calculation. However, as it stands, this is the general formula for the total students.\n\nWe'll wait to see if Agent Code Executor can perhaps articulate this in code to verify our expressions before concluding."

      "content": "It seems the problem hinges on determining the number of students given the information about the sports groups. From the explanations provided by both agents, we understand:\n\n- 6 students are playing tennis.\n- 12 students are playing volleyball (since it's twice the number of tennis players).\n- There are 22 girls playing soccer, and an unspecified number of boys playing soccer.\n\nTo solve for the total number of students, we have \\(6 + 12 + (x + 22)\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of boys playing soccer. This simplifies to \\(40 + x\\).\n\nHowever, without the specific number of boys playing soccer, \\(x\\), we cannot determine an exact numerical total for all the students. The total will indeed depend on an additional value for \\(x\\).\n\nTherefore, based on the information at hand and the solutions proposed:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
