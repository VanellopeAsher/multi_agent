Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Costs**:\n   - Cost of pots: $19\n   - Cost of garden soil: $26\n\n2. **Calculate the Initial Total**:\n   Sum of individual items = Cost of pots + Cost of garden soil\n   \\[\n   19 + 26 = 45\n   \\]\n   So, the initial total cost of purchases is $45.\n\n3. **Apply the Discount**:\n   Your mother used a discount voucher that reduced the total by $7. \n   So, we subtract the discount from the initial total:\n   \\[\n   45 - 7 = 38\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Final Amount Spent**:\n   Therefore, after applying the discount, the total amount your mother expended at the gardening store is $38.\n\nIn conclusion, your mother spent a total of $38 at the gardening store after using her discount voucher."

The total initial cost of items was calculated correctly as:\n   - Cost of pots: $19\n   - Cost of garden soil: $26\n   - Total before discount = $19 + $26 = $45\n\n2. The discount applied was $7, which was subtracted from the initial total:\n   - Total after discount = $45 - $7 = $38\n\nHaving evaluated the correctness of each step and the consistency between the two agents, I am confident in declaring the final solution.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{38}**"
