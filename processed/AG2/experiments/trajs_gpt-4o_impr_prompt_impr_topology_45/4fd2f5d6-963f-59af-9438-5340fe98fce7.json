      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the cost savings, the cost of materials, and the total cost.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define the Terms:**\n   - Let \\( M \\) represent the cost of materials.\n   - Let \\( T \\) represent the total cost if Ethan bought the wallpaper instead of making it himself.\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the savings from making the wallpaper himself.\n\n2. **Given Information:**\n   - Ethan saves 20% of the total cost \\( T \\) because he made the wallpaper himself, which we can express as:\n     \\[\n     S = 0.2 \\times T\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, his cost when making the wallpaper is:\n     \\[\n     C = T - S\n     \\]\n\n3. **Decision:** \n   Since Ethan made the wallpaper himself, his total cost is equivalent to the cost of the materials:\n   \\[\n   C = M\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combining the Equations:**\n   - From the savings equation \\( S = 0.2 \\times T \\), we substitute \\( S \\) into the equation for cost:\n     \\[\n     M = T - 0.2 \\times T\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     M = 0.8 \\times T \n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving for the Total Cost \\( T \\):**\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{M}{0.8}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - To find the total cost \\( T \\), you need to know the cost of materials \\( M \\). Once \\( M \\) is specified, use the formula \\( T = \\frac{M}{0.8} \\) to calculate the total cost.\n\nEngage in discussion with the other agents to validate this approach and make adjustments if necessary."
