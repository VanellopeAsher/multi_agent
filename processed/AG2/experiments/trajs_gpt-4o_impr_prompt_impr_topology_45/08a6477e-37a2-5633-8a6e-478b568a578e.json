On Day 2:\n   - Use 10 fewer, so \\(x - 10\\) bandages used.\n   - Remaining = \\(69 - x - (x - 10) = 79 - 2x\\).\n\n3. On Day 3:\n   - Order 2 bulk packs: Total ordered = \\(2 \\times 50 = 100\\) bandages.\n   - Total after orders = \\(79 - 2x + 100 = 179 - 2x\\).\n   - Use \\(25\\) (half a pack).\n   - Remaining = \\(179 - 2x - 25 = 154 - 2x\\).\n\n4. Given the remaining is 78:\n   \\[\n   154 - 2x = 78 \\implies 76 = 2x \\implies x = 38\n   \\]\n\n### Review of Code Error:\nAs evident from the code execution output (33.0), there shares possible oversight in the formula or logic for the specific sequence. Let's debug:\n\nUpon review, it appears I might have carried an incorrect equation in duplication. Thank you, Agent_Code_Executor, for detecting the discrepancy with practical application.
