I'll calculate the total number of calls Tim handles in a week by converting work hours to minutes and further dividing by the time required for each call.\n\nHereâ€™s the code to find the solution:\n\n```python\n# Define the constants for working hours and call duration\ndaily_work_hours = 6\nadditional_friday_hours = 2\ndaily_minutes = 60\ncall_duration_minutes = 15\n\n# Calculate total work minutes for Monday to Thursday\nmonday_to_thursday_minutes = daily_work_hours * daily_minutes\n\n# Calculate number of calls from Monday to Thursday\ncalls_monday_to_thursday = monday_to_thursday_minutes // call_duration_minutes * 4\n\n# Calculate total work minutes for Friday\nfriday_minutes = (daily_work_hours + additional_friday_hours) * daily_minutes\n\n# Calculate number of calls on Friday\ncalls_friday = friday_minutes // call_duration_minutes\n\n# Total number of calls in a week\ntotal_calls = calls_monday_to_thursday + calls_friday\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_calls)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
