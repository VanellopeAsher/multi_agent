Sally starts with a \\$0.50 higher rate than Billy, making her initial rate \\$10.50. She receives a \\$0.50 raise after 2 months, resulting in her hourly rate being \\$11.00.\n3. Both work 20 hours.\n4. Earnings calculation:\n   - Billy: 20 hours at \\$11.50/hour = \\$230.00\n   - Sally: 20 hours at \\$11.00/hour = \\$220.00\n\nThe difference is \\$230 - \\$220 = \\$10.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10}**"
