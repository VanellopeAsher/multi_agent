Then, we'll find out how many cards she gives to students and subsequently determine the number of students.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution**:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of basketball cards**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of basketball cards} = 6 \\text{ decks} \\times 25 \\text{ cards per deck} = 150 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of baseball cards**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of baseball cards} = 5 \\text{ boxes} \\times 40 \\text{ cards per box} = 200 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of soccer cards**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of soccer cards} = 30 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum up all the sports cards**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cards} = 150 \\, (\\text{basketball}) + 200 \\, (\\text{baseball}) + 30 \\, (\\text{soccer}) = 380 \\, \\text{cards}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of cards Miss Maria keeps**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cards Miss Maria keeps} = 50 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of cards Miss Maria gives to her students**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cards given to students} = 380 \\, (\\text{total cards}) - 50 \\, (\\text{cards kept}) = 330 \\, \\text{cards}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the number of students**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students} = \\frac{330 \\, \\text{cards given}}{10 \\, \\text{cards per student}} = 33 \\, \\text{students}\n   \\]\n\nMiss Maria has 33 students. \n\nNow, I'll engage in a discussion with Agent Code Executor to verify if there's any Python code that could demonstrate this calculation, and with Agent Verifier for the verification of the solution."
