According to Kelly, Courtney overstated the audience size by 20%. Thus, Courtney's reported number of attendees is 120% of the actual number.\n\nGiven that the actual audience size, \\( A \\), is 40 (as stated by Kelly), we can set up the equation for Courtney's reported audience size:\n\n\\[ \\text{Reported Audience Size by Courtney} = 1.2 \\times A \\]\n\nSince \\( A = 40 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Reported Audience Size by Courtney} = 1.2 \\times 40 = 48 \\]\n\nTherefore, according to Courtney, the audience size was 48 people."
