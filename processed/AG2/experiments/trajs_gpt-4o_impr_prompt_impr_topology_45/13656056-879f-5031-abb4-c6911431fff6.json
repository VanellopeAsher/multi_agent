      "content": "Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. **Determine Gerald's Earnings**: First, calculate the total earnings for Gerald in one week. Assuming he works 7 days a week, we can multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he worked.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Daily Earnings} \\times \\text{Number of Days}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 300 \\times 7 = 2100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Expenses**: We know from the problem statement that Gerald spent a total of $1000 during this week.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Money**: Subtract the expenses from the total earnings to determine how much Gerald has left.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Left} = \\text{Total Earnings} - \\text{Expenses}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Left} = 2100 - 1000 = 1100\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after spending $1000, Gerald has $1100 left from his weekly earnings. \n\nI'll discuss my findings with the team to see if everyone agrees with this solution."

This results in total earnings of:\n      \\[\n      300 \\times 7 = 2100\n      \\]\n    - After subtracting the $1000 of expenses, the amount he has left is:\n      \\[\n      2100 - 1000 = 1100\n      \\]\n\n2. **Code Execution by Agent Code Executor**:\n    - The Python code executed correctly, matching the expected output of $1100.\n\nBoth approaches corroborate each other and align with the problem statement. I've verified that the values used are solely from the information provided in the problem, adhering to the requirement of not assuming values.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Gerald has left after expenses is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{1100}**"
