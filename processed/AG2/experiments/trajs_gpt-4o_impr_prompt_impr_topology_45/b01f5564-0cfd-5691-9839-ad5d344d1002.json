In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To determine the amount of protein John gets from eating 300 grams of mushrooms every day for a week, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Protein per Gram of Mushrooms:**\n   - We know that 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein.\n   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Protein per gram} = \\frac{4 \\text{ grams}}{150 \\text{ grams}} = \\frac{2}{75} \\text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Daily Protein Intake:**\n   - John eats 300 grams of mushrooms daily.\n   - The protein intake from 300 grams is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Daily protein intake} = 300 \\text{ grams} \\times \\frac{2}{75} = 8 \\text{ grams of protein per day}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Weekly Protein Intake:**\n   - To find out John's weekly protein intake, multiply his daily intake by 7 (days in a week):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Weekly protein intake} = 8 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 56 \\text{ grams of protein per week}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John gets 56 grams of protein per week from eating 300 grams of mushrooms every day. \n\nIs there anything you would like to discuss or clarify about this solution with the rest of the team?"

Let's review their logic:\n\n1. **Protein per Gram of Mushrooms**: \n   - 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein, which means each gram of mushroom contains \\(\\frac{2}{75}\\) grams of protein.\n\n2. **Daily Protein Intake**:\n   - John eats 300 grams of mushrooms, so he gets \\(300 \\times \\frac{2}{75} = 8\\) grams of protein per day.\n\n3. **Weekly Protein Intake**:\n   - Over a week, John gets \\(8 \\times 7 = 56\\) grams of protein.\n\nThe solution proposed by both agents is consistent, and the calculations are correct. Therefore, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{56}**"
