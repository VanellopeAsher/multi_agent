  "problem": "Kim has recently launched a housekeeping business and is trying to figure out his weekly expenses. He currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential clients, whom he is confident enough to include in his calculations. Each client's home will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2. These are his only expenses. He estimates that his total weekly income will be $92, and he makes a profit of $20 each week. If profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, how much does each pack of cloths costs?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weekly expenses for Kim's housekeeping business and use the details given to figure out the cost of each pack of cloths.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Clients:**\n   - Kim has 3 existing clients.\n   - He is in talks with 5 more potential clients.\n   - **Total number of clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.**\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Items Needed for Cleaning:**\n   - Each client's home requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.\n   - For 8 clients, Kim will need:\n     - **Number of bleach bottles = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles.**\n     - **Number of cloth packs = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.**\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost of Bleach:**\n   - Each bottle of bleach costs $2.\n   - **Total cost for bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32.**\n\n4. **Determine Weekly Expenses:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the cost of one pack of cloths.\n   - Total expense for cloths = 8 packs * \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Write the Equation for Total Expenses:**\n   - Total expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths.\n   - **Total expenses = $32 + 8x.**\n\n6. **Use the Profit Equation:**\n   - Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses.\n   - Given, Profit = $20 and Total Income = $92.\n   - Thus, $20 = $92 - Total Expenses.\n   - **Total Expenses = $92 - $20 = $72.**\n\n7. **Set up the Equation and Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - $32 + 8x = $72.\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     8x = 72 - 32 \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     8x = 40 \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 40 / 8 \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 5 \n     \\]\n\nHence, the cost of each pack of cloths is $5.\n"

Let's verify the results step by step:\n\n1. **Number of Clients:**\n   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 \n\n2. **Cleaning Supplies Requirement:**\n   - Bleach bottles for 8 clients = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles\n   - Cloth packs for 8 clients = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs\n\n3. **Expense for Bleach:**\n   - Each bottle costs $2, so total cost for bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32\n\n4. **Total Expenses:**\n   - Overall, weekly expenses (derived from income and profit) = Total Income - Profit = $92 - $20 = $72\n\n5. **Equation for Expenses Involving Cloths:**\n   - Total expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths \n   - $72 = $32 + 8x (where x = cost per pack of cloths)\n\n6. **Solve for x:**\n   - $72 = $32 + 8x\n   - 8x = $72 - $32 = $40\n   - x = $40 / 8 = $5\n\nBoth agents have calculated consistently that the cost of each pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the final verified solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5}**"
