The calculation for how many days Mark needs to work, given the starting balance, daily earnings, and bike cost, is consistent across both approaches.\n\n**Here's the breakdown:**\n\n1. Mark starts with $50.5.\n2. The bike costs $300.5.\n3. The additional amount needed is $250 ($300.5 - $50.5).\n4. Mark earns $12.5 per day.\n5. The number of days needed is calculated by dividing the additional amount by the daily earnings: \\( \\frac{250}{12.5} = 20 \\).\n\nThus, I verify and confirm that the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{20}**"
