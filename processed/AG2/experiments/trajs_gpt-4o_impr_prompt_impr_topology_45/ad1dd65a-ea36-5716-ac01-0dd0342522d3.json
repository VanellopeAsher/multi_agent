Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Phones:**\n   - Each phone costs $700, and the seller bought 5 phones.\n   - Total cost of phones = 5 phones Ã— $700/phone = $3500.\n\n2. **Add the Cost of the Tablet:**\n   - The tablet costs $330.\n   - Total cost so far = $3500 (phones) + $330 (tablet) = $3830.\n\n3. **Add the Cost of the Headphones:**\n   - The headphones cost $137.\n   - Total overall cost = $3830 (phones + tablet) + $137 (headphones) = $3967.\n\n4. **Calculate the Change:**\n   - The amount given by the seller is $4000.\n   - Change to be given back = $4000 - $3967 = $33.\n\nThus, the seller will give back $33 in change after the transactions."

For the 5 phones at $700 each, the total cost is \\(5 \\times 700 = 3500\\).\n\n2. Adding the cost of the tablet, the new total is \\(3500 + 330 = 3830\\).\n\n3. Adding the cost of the headphones, the overall total becomes \\(3830 + 137 = 3967\\).\n\nFinally, subtracting the total cost from the amount given \\(4000 - 3967 = 33\\) yields the change.\n\nBoth the individually outlined calculations and the Python code confirm that the seller should indeed give back $33 in change.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{33}**"
