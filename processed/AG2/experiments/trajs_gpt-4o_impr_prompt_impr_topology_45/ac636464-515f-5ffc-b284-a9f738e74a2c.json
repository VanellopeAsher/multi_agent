      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break down each part of James' swimming journey:\n\n1. **Calculate the Initial Distance Swam by James:**\n   - Total distance of the lake: 30 miles.\n   - He swims 70% of the distance at first.\n   - Therefore, the initial distance swam = \\( 30 \\times 0.7 = 21 \\) miles.\n\n2. **Determine the Time to Swim the Initial Distance:**\n   - Speed during this part = 3 miles per hour.\n   - Time to swim 21 miles = \\( \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Calculate the Rest Time on the Island:**\n   - He rests for half as long as he swam the first part.\n   - Rest time = \\( \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the Remaining Distance to Swim:**\n   - Total distance of the lake is 30 miles and 21 miles have been covered.\n   - Remaining distance = \\( 30 - 21 = 9 \\) miles.\n\n5. **Determine the Time to Swim the Remaining Distance:**\n   - He swims at half his original speed for the remaining distance.\n   - New swimming speed = \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) miles per hour.\n   - Time to swim 9 miles = \\( \\frac{9}{1.5} = 6 \\) hours.\n\n6. **Total Time to Get Across the Lake:**\n   - Time to swim the first 21 miles + Rest time + Time to swim the remaining 9 miles.\n   - Total time = \\( 7 + 3.5 + 6 = 16.5 \\) hours.\n\nThus, James took 16.5 hours to swim across the lake. \n\nLet's discuss if this approach aligns with everyone's understanding or if there are any parts we can optimize or clarify further!"
