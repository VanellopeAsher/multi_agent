According to the problem statement, we have:\n\n\\[ 45 = 10x - 15 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we'll solve the equation:\n\n1. Add 15 to both sides to remove the subtraction:\n   \\[\n   45 + 15 = 10x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   60 = 10x\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 10 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{10}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\n\nThus, the age of Carver's son is 6 years.\n\nNow that we have reached this conclusion manually, let's proceed with discussing this solution with the other agents where I will give my input.\n\nBoth methods, computational and manual, have deduced that Carver's son is 6 years old. Would anyone like to add or adjust any part of our solution strategy, or shall we consider it verified and concluded?"
