Thus, his weekly earnings from the daycare are \\( 30 \\times 7 = 210 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Babysitting Earnings**: \n   - He babysits 2 hours each day at a rate of $0. Hence, his total babysitting earnings are \\( 2 \\times 7 \\times 0 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Total Earnings for the Week**: \n   - Total earnings comprise daycare earnings and babysitting earnings: \\( 210 + 0 = 210 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate Expenses**: \n   - Gerald spends $100 on groceries and other necessities.\n\n5. **Calculate Money Left**: \n   - Subtract his expenses from total earnings: \\( 210 - 100 = 110 \\).\n\nTherefore, the calculations verify that the correct amount of money Gerald has left is $110.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{110}**"
