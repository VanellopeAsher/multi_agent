Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Fish Tank**: Scarlett spent $10.00 on the fish tank.\n\n2. **Stones**: She purchased two packets of stones at $2.50 each.\n   - Total cost for stones = 2 packets × $2.50 = $5.00\n\n3. **Coral Pieces**: She bought three coral pieces at $2.00 each.\n   - Total cost for coral pieces = 3 pieces × $2.00 = $6.00\n\n4. **Fish**: She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.\n   - Total cost for fish = 20 fish × $0.50 = $10.00\n\n5. **Fish Food**: She bought one packet of fish food for $2.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount spent by summing up all these costs:\n\n- Total cost = $10.00 (fish tank) + $5.00 (stones) + $6.00 (coral pieces) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food)\n- Total cost = $33.00\n\nTherefore, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
