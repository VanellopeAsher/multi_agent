      "content": "To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working at his part-time job instead, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Video Game Hours Per Day**: First, we need to know how many hours Jordan spends playing video games each day. As the problem doesn't specify the exact number of hours, let's establish a variable, \\( x \\), to represent the number of hours per day.\n\n2. **Calculate Weekly Work Hours**: Multiply the daily video game hours by 7 to get the total number of hours Jordan would work in a week. This is calculated as \\( 7 \\times x \\).\n\n3. **Compute Earnings**: With Jordan earning $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from these hours would be \n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings} = 10 \\times 7 \\times x = 70x\n   \\]\n   dollars, assuming he works every day for the hours he usually plays video games.\n\n4. **Solution Validation**: The solution is based on knowing \\( x \\). Once \\( x \\) is provided, it can be substituted into the formula to determine Jordan's earnings per week.\n\nEngaging in discussion, if anyone has alternative perspectives or further inputs (e.g., assumptions, constraints), feel free to contribute."

Both solutions proposed by the agents assumed a specific number of hours of video game play, whereas the original problem statement did not provide this critical piece of information. Without this data, any calculation on Jordan's earnings would be speculative at best.\n\nGiven the lack of necessary information on daily video game hours, the problem is unsolvable in its current form. I cannot make any assumptions about the value of \\( x \\) or rely on the assumed values provided by the agents.\n\nTherefore, according to the guidelines:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}**"
