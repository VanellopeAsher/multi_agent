      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home.\n   - 20 students do not have desktop computers, which represents one-third of the students who neither have a desktop nor a laptop.\n   \n2. **Defining Variables:**\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the total number of students.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of students who do not have either a desktop or a laptop.\n   \n3. **Setting Up Equations:**\n   - According to the problem, if 20 students do not have desktop computers and this number represents one-third of the students who have neither a desktop nor a laptop, it means:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 20 = x \\quad \\text{(since 20 is one-third of } x \\text{)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 60\n     \\]\n   - Thus, 60 students do not have either a desktop or a laptop.\n   - Three-fourths of students have a desktop, so one-fourth do not. The one-fourth that do not have a desktop includes those without either device:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4}T = 60\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving For Total Students \\( T \\):**\n   - From the equation above:\n     \\[\n     T = 4 \\times 60 = 240\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, there are 240 students in that grade level.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are 240 students at that grade level.\n\nThis procedure outlines how to use the given relationships and conditions to determine the total number of students. Let's discuss any alternative strategies or verify the logic with the team."

      "content": "Both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor have proposed solutions indicating that the total number of students at the grade level is 240.\n\nHere's the logical deduction once again:\n\n1. Given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this number represents one-third of the students who neither have a desktop nor a laptop, we find that the full group of students without either is 60 students.\n\n2. The problem statement tells us that three-fourths of the total students have a desktop computer. Hence, one-fourth do not have a desktop, equivalent to the 60 students identified above.\n\n3. Therefore, the equation for the total number of students \\( T \\) based on the one-fourth who do not have a desktop is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}T = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. Solving for \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   T = 4 \\times 60 = 240\n   \\]\n\nGiven the consistent result from different approaches, the solution to the problem is confirmed.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{240}**"
