  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to establish equations based on the mechanic's charges for the day.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Determine Thursday's Earnings:**\n\n   - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires on Thursday.\n   - Charge for truck tires: \\( 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\) dollars.\n   - Charge for car tires: \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\) dollars.\n   - Total earnings on Thursday: \\( 360 + 160 = 520 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Determine Friday's Earnings and Equation:**\n\n   - Let's say the mechanic repairs \\( x \\) car tires on Friday.\n   - Earnings from repairing car tires on Friday: \\( x \\times 40 \\) dollars.\n   - According to the problem, the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.\n   - Equation for Friday's earnings: \n\n     \\[\n     520 = 40x + 40\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   520 = 40x + 40\n   \\]\n\n   - Subtract 40 from both sides:\n\n     \\[\n     480 = 40x\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide both sides by 40:\n\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{480}{40} = 12\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solution is confirmed according to the problem conditions, ensuring that the discrepancy between Thursday and Friday earnings aligns with the logic presented. The mechanic repairs **12 car tires on Friday**. \n\nPlease let me know if there are any further questions or need for clarifications!"
