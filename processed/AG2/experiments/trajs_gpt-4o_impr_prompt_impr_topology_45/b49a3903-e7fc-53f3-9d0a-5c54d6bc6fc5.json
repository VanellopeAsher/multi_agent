      "content": "To determine how many total rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to break down the number of rows for each color of tulip and account for the additional rows of yellow tulips.\n\n1. **Calculate Rows for Red Tulips:**\n   - Jackson has 36 red tulips.\n   - Each row can hold 6 red tulips.\n   - Therefore, the number of rows of red tulips is \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) rows.\n\n2. **Calculate Rows for Blue Tulips:**\n   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips.\n   - Each row can hold 8 blue tulips.\n   - Therefore, the number of rows of blue tulips is \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\) rows.\n\n3. **Calculate Rows for Yellow Tulips:**\n   - Jackson wants to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips.\n   - He has 30 yellow tulips. \n   - Each row can hold 5 yellow tulips.\n   - Therefore, the number of yellow tulip rows he can make is \\( \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\) rows.\n\n4. **Determine Total Rows:**\n   - Assuming the pattern is such that a yellow row follows every red and blue row, here's a scenario: \n     - Red Row 1 -> Yellow Row 1\n     - Red Row 2 -> Yellow Row 2\n     - Red Row 3 -> Yellow Row 3\n     - Red Row 4 -> Yellow Row 4\n     - Red Row 5 -> Yellow Row 5\n     - Red Row 6 -> Yellow Row 6\n     - Blue Row 1 -> Yellow Row 1\n     - Blue Row 2 -> Yellow Row 2\n     - Blue Row 3 -> Yellow Row 3\n\nFrom this understanding, we can see that for every unique colored row (either red or blue), there is one yellow row between:\n\n- After the 6 rows of red tulips, there are 6 yellow rows.\n- After adding 3 blue tulips rows, he needs 3 more yellow rows to separate each unique blue row as well.\n\nThus, Jackson will plant a total of \\( 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\) rows of flowers in total.\n\nThis analysis assumes that Jackson uses all his available yellow tulips and intends to create a pattern, rather than solely maximizing the number of yellow rows."
