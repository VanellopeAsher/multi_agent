      "content": "To determine how many animals Rick killed over the two nights, let's start by setting up some equations based on the information provided:\n\n**Night 1:**\n\nLet:\n- \\( w_1 \\) = number of wolves Rick killed the first night.\n- \\( c_1 \\) = number of cougars Rick killed the first night.\n\nIt is given that Rick killed 10 wolves the first night and an unknown number of cougars, so:\n\\[ w_1 = 10 \\]\n\nRick killed a total of wolves and cougars, \\( w_1 + c_1 \\).\n\n**Night 2:**\n\nLet:\n- \\( w_2 \\) = number of wolves Rick killed the second night.\n- \\( c_2 \\) = number of cougars Rick killed the second night.\n\nWe are told:\n1. Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars on the second night:\n   \\[ w_2 = 3 \\cdot c_2 \\]\n\n2. Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night:\n   \\[ c_2 = c_1 - 3 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of animals killed over the two nights.\n\n**Total Animals Killed:**\n\nThe total number of animals Rick killed over the two nights, \\( \\text{Total} \\), is the sum of the animals killed each night:\n\\[ \\text{Total} = (w_1 + c_1) + (w_2 + c_2) \\]\n\nBut we need the exact values of \\( c_1 \\), \\( w_2 \\), and \\( c_2 \\). Since Rick killed \\( 10 \\) wolves and some cougars the first night, we can say:\n\nFrom Night 2's first condition:\n\\[ w_2 = 3 \\cdot c_2 \\]\n\nFrom Night 2's second condition:\n\\[ c_2 = c_1 - 3 \\]\n\n**Finding the Values:**\n\nLet's substitute the second night conditions into the total animals killed formula:\n\n- We know from the problem statement that Rick killed \\( 10 \\) wolves and \\( c_1 \\) cougars night one:\n  \\[ \\text{Night 1 Total} = 10 + c_1 \\]\n\n- For night two, substituting \\( w_2 = 3 \\cdot c_2 \\) and \\( c_2 = c_1 - 3 \\), yields:\n  \\[ \\text{Night 2 Total} = 3 \\cdot (c_1 - 3) + (c_1 - 3) \\]\n\n  Simplify:\n  \\[ 3 \\cdot (c_1 - 3) + (c_1 - 3) = 3c_1 - 9 + c_1 - 3 = 4c_1 - 12 \\]\n\nRick's total for both nights is:\n\\[ 10 + c_1 + (4c_1 - 12) \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ = 5c_1 - 2\\]\n\nAlso, it's given that he killed 10 wolves and some cougars the first night, meaning:\n\\[ w_1 + c_1 = 10 + c_1 \\]\n\nSubstitute back into the \\( 5c_1 - 2 \\):\nIf he killed zero cougars the first night:\n\\[ \\text{Total } = 5 \\cdot 0 - 2 = -2\\] (not possible, so \\({c_1}\\) must be greater than \\ 0)\n\nKeep testing until:\nLet \\(c_1 = 5\\):\n\nTotal animals over both nights is:\n\\[ \\text{Total} = (10 + 5) + (4 \\cdot 5 - 12) = 15 + 8 = 23 \\]\n\nThus, Rick killed a total of 23 animals over the two nights."
