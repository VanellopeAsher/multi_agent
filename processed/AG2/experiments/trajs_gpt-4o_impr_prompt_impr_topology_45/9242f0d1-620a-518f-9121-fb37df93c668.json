  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

To find out how much she will have left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:\n\n- Remaining money = €1500 (budget) - €1423 (total cost) = €77\n\nTherefore, Elvira will have €77 left to spend on her new outfit."

They have accurately calculated the total expenditure and subtracted it from the budget to find out how much money Elvira will have left for her new outfit.\n\nHere is a step-by-step confirmation based on their work:\n\n1. Elvira's starting budget is €1500.\n2. The items she purchases and their costs are:\n   - Computer setup: €1090\n   - Scanner: €157\n   - CD burner: €74\n   - Printer: €102\n\n3. The total cost of these items is:\n   \\[\n   1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtracting the total cost from her budget:\n   \\[\n   1500 - 1423 = 77 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n\nHence, **the correct solution is:**\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{77}**"
