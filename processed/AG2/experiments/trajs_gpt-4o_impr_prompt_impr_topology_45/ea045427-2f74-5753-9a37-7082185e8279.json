      "content": "To determine how much William spent in all, we can divide the problem into a few steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of one notebook and two ballpens:**\n   - The cost of one notebook is $1.50.\n   - The cost of one ballpen is $0.50.\n   - Therefore, the cost of two ballpens will be \\( 2 \\times 0.50 = $1.00 \\).\n   - The total cost of one notebook and two ballpens is \\( 1.50 + 1.00 = $2.50 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the pencil case:**\n   - The pencil case costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens.\n   - Hence, the cost of the pencil case is \\( 2 \\times 2.50 = $5.00 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount William spent:**\n   - William bought five notebooks, costing \\( 5 \\times 1.50 = $7.50 \\).\n   - He also bought a ballpen costing $0.50.\n   - Total cost for the items excluding the pencil case is \\( 7.50 + 0.50 = $8.00 \\).\n   - Adding the cost of the pencil case, the grand total is \\( 8.00 + 5.00 = $13.00 \\).\n\nIn conclusion, William spent a total of $13.00."
