In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of money Gerald earned for the week and then calculate how much he spent to end up with $110 in savings.\n\n1. **Determine the total earnings**:  \n   Gerald earns $30 per day. Since a week consists of 7 days, we calculate his weekly earnings as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total earnings in a week} = 30 \\, \\text{dollars/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 210 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount spent**:  \n   Gerald saved $110 after working a full week. To find out how much he spent, we subtract his savings from the total amount he earned:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent} = \\text{Total earnings} - \\text{Savings} = 210 \\, \\text{dollars} - 110 \\, \\text{dollars} = 100 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, Gerald spent $100. \n\nLet's discuss this with the other agents if needed."
