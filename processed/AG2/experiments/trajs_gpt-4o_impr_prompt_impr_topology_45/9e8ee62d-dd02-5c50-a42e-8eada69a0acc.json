Therefore, it will be \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches.\n   - After the third week, the beanstalk is stated to be 10 inches tall.\n\n2. **Calculate the growth in the third week:**\n   - We already have the height at the end of each week:\n     - End of first week: 3 inches.\n     - End of second week: 6 inches.\n     - End of third week: 10 inches.\n   - The growth in the third week can be calculated by subtracting the height at the end of the second week from the height at the end of the third week:\n     - \\(10 \\text{ inches} - 6 \\text{ inches} = 4 \\text{ inches}\\).\n\nTherefore, the beanstalk grew 4 inches during the third week. \n\nLet's discuss to ensure we all agree with this conclusion."
