      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the total number of people Billy helps between March 1st and April 19th, considering he takes 20% of the days off. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Working Days:**\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - April 19th is the 19th day of April.\n   - Total days from March 1st to April 19th = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days Billy Takes Off:**\n   - Billy takes off 20% of these 50 days.\n   - Number of days taken off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Billy Works:**\n   - Total working days = Total days - Days taken off\n   - Total working days = 50 - 10 = 40 days\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of People Billy Helps Per Day:**\n   - Billy helps 2 people per hour.\n   - Billy works for 3.5 hours each day.\n   - People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3.5 hours = 7 people\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of People Billy Helps:**\n   - Total people helped = People helped per day * Total working days\n   - Total people helped = 7 people/day * 40 days = 280 people\n\nThus, Billy helps a total of 280 people during this period."

Let's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Total Days Calculation**:\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - Up to April 19th, there are 19 days in April.\n   - Total days from March 1st to April 19th = 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n\n2. **Days Taken Off**:\n   - Billy takes off 20% of 50 days, which is \\(0.20 \\times 50 = 10\\) days.\n\n3. **Working Days**:\n   - Total working days = 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n\n4. **People Helped Per Day**:\n   - Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours each day.\n   - People helped per day = \\(2 \\text{ people/hour} \\times 3.5 \\text{ hours} = 7\\) people.\n\n5. **Total People Helped**:\n   - Total people helped = 7 people/day \\(\\times\\) 40 days = 280 people.\n\nBoth the calculation and the code confirm that Billy helps a total of 280 people.
