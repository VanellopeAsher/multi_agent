The following day, they used ten bandages less than the previous day. On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages and only expended half a pack. They had 78 bandages remaining at the conclusion of the third day. Can you determine the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day?",

Let me know if you have any questions or if further verification is needed."
