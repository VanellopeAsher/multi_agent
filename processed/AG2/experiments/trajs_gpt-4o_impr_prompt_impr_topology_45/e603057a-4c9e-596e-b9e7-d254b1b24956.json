Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the current age of Seth.\n   - Let \\( B \\) be the current age of Brooke.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations**:\n   - From the first piece of information, \"Seth is twice as old as Brooke,\" we can write:\n     \\[\n     S = 2B\n     \\]\n\n   - From the second piece of information, \"In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 36,\" we can write:\n     \\[\n     (S + 3) + (B + 3) = 36\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Second Equation**:\n   - Simplifying the second equation, we have:\n     \\[\n     S + B + 6 = 36\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 6 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     S + B = 30\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute the Value of \\( S \\)**:\n   - From step 2, substitute \\( S = 2B \\) in the equation \\( S + B = 30 \\):\n     \\[\n     2B + B = 30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3B = 30\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for Brooke's Age**:\n   - Divide both sides by 3:\n     \\[\n     B = 10\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve for Seth's Age**:\n   - Substitute \\( B = 10 \\) back into the equation \\( S = 2B \\):\n     \\[\n     S = 2(10)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S = 20\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Seth is currently 20 years old. \n\nLet's discuss this logic and approach with other agents to ensure its accuracy."
