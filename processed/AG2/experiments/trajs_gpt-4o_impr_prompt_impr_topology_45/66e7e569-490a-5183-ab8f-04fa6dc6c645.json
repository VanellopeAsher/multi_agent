Here's the analysis:\n\n- Using the ratio from the given information, 60 potatoes produce 360 hash browns, thus each potato yields 6 hash browns.\n- Multiplying the number of potatoes (960) by 6 hash browns per potato gives us the total hash browns: 5760.\n\nThe calculated solution is consistent and logical across both approaches provided. Therefore, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5760}**"
