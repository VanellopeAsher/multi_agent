      "content": "To find out the length of the shark, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:\n   - We have 2 remoras attached to a shark.\n   - Each remora is 6 inches long, making the combined length of the remoras \\(6 + 6 = 12\\) inches.\n   - This combined length of 12 inches is 10% of the shark's total body length.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   - Let the length of the shark be represented by \\(S\\) inches.\n   - According to the problem statement, 10% of the shark's length is equal to the combined length of the remoras. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n     \\[\n     0.10 \\times S = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(S\\)**:\n   - To find the length of the shark (\\(S\\)), we need to solve the equation:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{12}{0.10}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(S\\):\n     \\[\n     S = 120\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The length of the shark is 120 inches. \n\nDoes anyone have questions, or is there anything that we should verify or discuss further?"
