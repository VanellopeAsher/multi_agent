      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine John's running speed based on the given information. We'll break down the information and calculate his speed step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Time Spent Running:**\n   - John runs 60 miles in total over 3 days each week.\n   - On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.\n   - On the second and third days, he runs for half as much time as he does on the first day, which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours for each day.\n   - Therefore, the total time spent running each week is:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total running time} = 3 \\text{ hours (first day)} + 1.5 \\text{ hours (second day)} + 1.5 \\text{ hours (third day)} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate John's Running Speed:**\n   - Since he covers 60 miles in 6 hours, we can calculate his average speed using the formula:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.\n\nThe time he rests after each run does not affect his running speed calculation, so it is not factored into the speed computation. The primary focus is on the actual running time and distance. \n\nLet me know if we need further discussion or any additional information!"
