On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.

      "content": "To solve the problem of calculating the total hours Frankie spent watching TV, let's approach it systematically by calculating the hours for each day:\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   - Frankie watches one hour-long episode.\n   - Total hours on Monday = 1 hour.\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   - Frankie watches another hour-long episode.\n   - Total hours on Tuesday = 1 hour.\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   - Frankie watches three 30-minute episodes.\n   - Since each 30-minute episode equals 0.5 hours, the total hours for Wednesday = 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 hours.\n\n4. **Thursday:**\n   - Frankie watches an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.\n   - Total hours on Thursday = 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.\n\n5. **Friday:**\n   - Frankie watches two one-hour episodes.\n   - Total hours on Friday = 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\nNow, add up the hours from each day to find the total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Hours} = 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total during the week."
