Let's verify the final calculations based on the problem statement:\n\n1. The cost for the chicken meal is $120.\n2. The cost for the milk is \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\).\n3. The cost for the apples is \\(40 \\times 1.50 = 60\\).\n4. Adding these costs gives \\(120 + 150 + 60 = 330\\).\n5. The total paid is $900, so the cost of pizzas is \\(900 - 330 = 570\\).\n6. Each box of pizza costs $57, so the number of pizza boxes is \\(570 / 57 = 10\\).\n\nThis was confirmed by the output of the executed code.\n\nHence, Marie ordered **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{10}** boxes of pizza."
