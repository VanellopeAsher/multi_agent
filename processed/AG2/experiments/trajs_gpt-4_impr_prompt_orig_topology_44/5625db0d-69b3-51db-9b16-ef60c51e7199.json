Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 15 apples at $15 each. At the checkout, she got $3 off because she had voucher. The next day, the price increased to $25 per fruit, but the store also offered a 15% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 15 apples. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the apples on the two days?"

Because you are a role-play assistant and lack the capability to execute code, I will calculate the results manually and provide the correct Python code for reference. \n\nLet's first calculation the total price Clara paid on Tuesday:\n\ntotal_price_tuesday = (price_per_apple_tuesday * no_of_apples) - voucher_discount\ntotal_price_tuesday = (15 * 15) - 3 \ntotal_price_tuesday = 225 - 3 \ntotal_price_tuesday = 222 dollars\n\nNext, we will calculate the total price Sheila paid on Wednesday:\n\ntotal_price_wednesday = (price_per_apple_wednesday * no_of_apples) * (1 - discount_wednesday)\ntotal_price_wednesday = (25 * 15) * (1 - 0.15)\ntotal_price_wednesday = 375 * 0.85\ntotal_price_wednesday = 318.75 dollars\n\nFinally, we will calculate the difference between the prices:\n\nprice_difference = total_price_wednesday - total_price_tuesday\nprice_difference = 318.75 - 222\nprice_difference = 96.75 dollars\n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the apples on the two days is \\$96.75.\n\nThis solution can be computed using the following Python code:\n\n```python\nprice_per_apple_tuesday = 15 # in dollars\nno_of_apples = 15\nvoucher_discount = 3 # in dollars\n\ntotal_price_tuesday = (price_per_apple_tuesday * no_of_apples) - voucher_discount\n\nprice_per_apple_wednesday = 25 # in dollars\ndiscount_wednesday = 15/100 # 15% expressed in decimal form\n\ntotal_price_wednesday = (price_per_apple_wednesday * no_of_apples) * (1 - discount_wednesday)\n\nprice_difference = total_price_wednesday - total_price_tuesday\nprint(price_difference)\n```\n\nNow, I will proceed with the verification.\n\nVERIFICATION:\nTo confirm if the calculated final price difference of $96.75 is correct, I will review the calculations:\n\nOn Tuesday:\n- Clara bought 15 apples \n- At $15 each \n- She had a $3 voucher, which she used\nFinal price: $222\n\nOn Wednesday:\n- Sheila also bought 15 apples \n- But now they cost $25 each \n- However, there was a 15% discount on the total cost\nFinal price: $318.75\n\nDifference: $318.75 - $222 = $96.75\nTime to breathe and ensure clarity of thought. \n\nThe problem-solving process and calculations done step by step appear correct and match the formulated Python code. There is confidence in the verification of the solution and the Python code is correct.\n\nSo the difference between the final prices paid for the apples on the two days is \boxed{96.75} dollars."
