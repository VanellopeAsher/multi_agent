  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys twenty 10-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys forty 120-pound bags.

We round up to the nearest whole number because the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this. First, we can calculate the total weight of feed the farmer buys.\n\nHere is the Python code for the first step:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Attached weights\nsugar_cubes_weight = 10 # in pound\ncarrots_weight = 120 # in pound\nhay_weight = 750 # in pound\noats_weight = 650 # in pound\n\n# no of feeds\nno_sugar_cubes = 20\nno_carrots = 40\nno_hay = 420\nno_oats = 200\n\ntotal_weight = (sugar_cubes_weight * no_sugar_cubes + carrots_weight * no_carrots + hay_weight * no_hay + oats_weight * no_oats)\ntotal_weight\n```\nAnd the second step, divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck and round up to get the total trips needed. Here is the Python code for this:\n\n```python\ntruck_capacity = 22500 # in pounds\n\n# calculating the number of trips\ntrips = math.ceil(total_weight / truck_capacity)\ntrips\n``` \n\nAfter running these commands, let me know the value of `total_weight` and `trips`."
