Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?"

      "content": "First of all, let's denote the numbers of small and large stuffed animals that Teresa sold as 's' and 'l' respectively. \n\nAccording to the first sentence of the problem statement, the price for a large stuffed animal is three times that of a small one, which costs $40. Therefore, one large stuffed animal costs $40 x 3 = $120.\n\nThe second sentence states that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, which means that the number of small stuffed animals sold is double the number of large ones, i.e., s = 2*l.\n\nThe third sentence gives the total sales made, which is $1200. The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of each type of stuffed animal sold by their respective prices. \n\nTherefore, we know that Teresa's total earnings from the sale of small stuffed animals ($ 40 * s) plus that from the sale of large stuffed animals ($ 120 * l) equals $ 1200.\n\nThere is Python library sympy, which can solve equation and system of equations.\n\nLet's solve this problem using sympy in Python.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# price of one small and large stuffed animal\nprice_small = 40\nprice_large = 120\n\n# total earnings\nearnings = 1200\n\n# declare the variables\ns, l = sp.symbols('s l')\n\n# equation 1: s = 2*l\neq1 = sp.Eq(s, 2*l)\n\n# equation 2: total cost = price_small * s + price_large * l\neq2 = sp.Eq(price_small * s + price_large * l, earnings)\n\n# solve the system of equations\nsolution = sp.solve((eq1,eq2), (s,l))\nprint(\"The number of small stuffed animals sold is:\", solution[s])\n\n```\nAfter running the above code, we get the values for 's' and 'l'. Our required output is the value of 's' which indicates the number of small stuffed animals sold. We'll omit 'l' as it is not asked in the problem statement."

      "content": "Perfect. Let's verify the calculation to ensure its correctness.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1) The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times that of a small one, which costs $40. Therefore, a large stuffed animal costs 3*$40 = $120.\n\n2) The relationship between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold is expressed by the equation 's = 2*l'.\n\n3) According to the equation, if we find the number of large stuffed animals sold, it would be 'l = s/2', and in this context it's 'l = 12/2 = 6'.\n\n4) The cost of the small stuffed animals sold equals the price of one small toy times the number sold. So, the revenue from the small stuffed animals is $40 * 12 = $480.\n\n5) Similarly, the revenue from the large stuffed animals sold is $120 * 6 = $720.\n\n6) The sum of the revenues from the large and small stuffed animals equal the total amount Teresa earned = $480 + $720 = $1200.\n\nBecause all the calculations are correct, and the total revenue matches the given amount of $1200, we can conclude with confidence that the number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{12}."
