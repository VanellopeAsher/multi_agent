Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6.6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2.5 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

We can use this to find the total time available.\n\n```python\ntotal_time_available = total_time_spent / 0.30  # from the problem statement\n```\n\nStep 5: Given that 40% of the available time was spent sightseeing, we can now calculate the time spent sightseeing. \n\n```python\nsightseeing_time = total_time_available * 0.40  # from the problem statement\nprint(sightseeing_time)\n``` \n\nYou can run the above code and provide the calculated sightseeing time."

The final, rounded value for the time John spent sightseeing is 23.2 hours.\n\nNow let's verify our solution:\n\nStep 1: Verify the calculations:\n- Boating time = 6.6 hours.\n- Swimming time, which is half of boating time = 6.6 / 2 = 3.3 hours.\n- Total time spent boating and swimming = 6.6 + 3.3 = 9.9 hours.\n- He watched three shows at 2.5 hours each, so total show time = 3 * 2.5 = 7.5 hours.\n- So, the time spent so far is boating, swimming and watching shows time = 9.9 + 7.5 = 17.4 hours, which is 30% of the total time available.\n- So, 100% of the total time = 17.4 / 30 * 100 = 58 hours.\n- As per the problem, 40% of the total time was spent sightseeing, so sightseeing time = 40 / 100 * 58 = 23.2 hours.\n\nWe calculated 23.2 hours for sightseeing time, and this matches the rounded value we computed. So, our answer is correct.\n\nOur final answer, using the \boxed{} format is \boxed{23.2} hours."
