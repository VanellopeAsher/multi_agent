Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCaroline has 4 children.  The first child is some feet tall.  The second child is two inches taller than the first child.  The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  The fourth child is 72 inches. How tall is the first child in feet?"

Reverse-engineer the problem. Start from the height of the fourth child, then calculate the height of each previous child using the clues given.\n2. Once we have the height for child 1 in inches, convert it to feet by dividing by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).\n\nLet's proceed following this approach."

We know that the fourth child is 72 inches tall.\n2. The third child is 3 inches shorter than the fourth, so subtract 3 from the fourth child's height.\n3. The second child is 5 inches taller than the third, so add 5 to the third child's height.\n4. The first child is 2 inches shorter than the second, so subtract 2 from the second child's height.\n5.
