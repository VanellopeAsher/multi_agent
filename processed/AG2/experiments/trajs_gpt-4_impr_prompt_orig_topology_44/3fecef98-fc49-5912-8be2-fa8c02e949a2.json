Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. He also wants to make a duvet cover, 9 feet long and 11 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?"

      "content": "This problem primarily involves arithmetic operations. \n\nHere are the main steps: \n1. Calculate the area of the fabric needed for the comforter. The king-sized bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, so the fabric needed should be (6+2) feet by (8+2) feet, i.e., 8 feet by 10 feet. The area of the fabric needed for the comforter therefore equals 8 * 10.\n2. Calculate the area of the fabric needed for the duvet cover. Its dimensions are given as 9 feet by 11 feet, so its area equals 9 * 11. \n3. Sum up the previous two results. This will give the total amount of fabric needed by Jim. \n\nNow  I will use Python to compute these steps. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Dimensions of the bed\nlength_bed = 6 # ft\nwidth_bed = 8 # ft\n\n# Extra length and width for the comforter\nextra_length = 2 # ft\nextra_width = 2 # ft\n\n# Calculate the area of fabric needed for the comforter\nlength_comforter = length_bed + extra_length\nwidth_comforter = width_bed + extra_width\narea_comforter = length_comforter * width_comforter\n\n# Dimensions of the duvet cover\nlength_duvet = 9 # ft\nwidth_duvet = 11 # ft\n\n# Calculate the area of fabric needed for the duvet cover\narea_duvet = length_duvet * width_duvet\n\n# Calculate the total area of fabric needed\ntotal_area = area_comforter + area_duvet\n\ntotal_area\n```\n\nCould you please carry out this computation? The answer will be in square feet."
