Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

      "content": "The key concept here is simple arithmetic operations. We need to add up all the cost components: the service fee, the hourly labor fee, and the parts cost.\n\nCost components:\n\n1. Service fee: $40\n2. Hourly labor fee: $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent (which was 2.25 hours)\n3. Parts cost: $60\n\nHere, the hourly labor cost should be calculated considering the fact that the fraction of an hour is billed as a full hour. So, we should round up the labor hours to the next whole number.\n\nWe have all the necessary inputs to solve the problem. We can write a Python program to calculate the total cost.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# cost components\nservice_fee = 40\nhourly_labor_fee = 35\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# labor hours\nlabor_hours = 2.25\n\n# calculate total labor cost\ntotal_labor_hours = math.ceil(labor_hours) # rounding up to the nearest whole number\ntotal_labor_cost = total_labor_hours * hourly_labor_fee\n\n# calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = service_fee + total_labor_cost + parts_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis Python program calculates the total amount that Patty's Plumbing will bill for the given job."

      "content": "After executing the provided Python program, we acquired the total amount billed by Patty is $205.\n\nVerification:\n1. The service fee of $40 is a flat amount for a house call.\n2. The time spent was 2.25 hours. Considering the policy of Patty's Plumbing to charge $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, the hours were rounded up to 3. Thus, the labor cost is 3 hours x $35/hour = $105.\n3. The cost of parts was $60.\n4. Adding these all together: $40 (service fee) + $105 (labor cost) + $60 (parts cost) = $205.\n\nThe calculations and reasoning are correct, so the final answer is correct.\n\nThe total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing for this job is \boxed{205} dollars."
