      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMrs. Harrington bought several boxes of oranges at the market. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Then she kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest. How many oranges did Mrs. Harrington sell if each box contains 20 oranges?"

      "content": "This task requires you to solve a mathematical problem in Python. It's a basic arithmetic calculation. Here is an explanation of how the problem breaks down:\n\n1. Determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought. Since we know she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, and then kept 1/4 of the oranges for herself. \n2. Let's denote the initially purchased number of boxes as X. Therefore, assuming all boxes contain an equal number of oranges, 4 boxes (2 for her mom and 2 for her sister) plus 1/4*X equals X (the total purchased boxes).\n3. After finding the total number of boxes, calculate the number of oranges sold. As each box consists of 20 oranges, and Mrs. Harrington sold 3/4 of the total  oranges.\n \nThe corresponding Python code will be:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\n# define the variable X\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# equation for the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought\nequation = X - 4 - 1/4*X\n\n# solve the equation to find X\ninitial_boxes = solve(equation, X)\n\n# calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought\ntotal_oranges = initial_boxes[0] * 20\n\n# calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold\noranges_sold = 3/4 * total_oranges\n\nprint(oranges_sold)\n```"
