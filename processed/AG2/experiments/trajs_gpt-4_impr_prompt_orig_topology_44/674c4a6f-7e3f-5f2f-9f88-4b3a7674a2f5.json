Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTo have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class. His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores. On those tests, he received: 70, 95, 88, 90 and 78. What is his current math grade?"

The average of a set of numbers is calculated by adding all the numbers together and dividing the total by the count of numbers. The formula of average is\n\n\\[avg = (a1 + a2 + ... + an) / n\\]\n\nWhere, ai is the ith number in the set and n is the count of numbers in the set.\n\nGiven that Wilson's test scores are: 70, 95, 88, 90 and 78. We will use Python to calculate the average score.\n\nOur Python code will look like this:\n\n```python\n# list to hold the test scores\ntest_scores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# use the built-in sum function to sum the scores and the len function to count the scores\naverage_score = sum(test_scores) / len(test_scores)\n\nprint(average_score)\n```\n\nWhat is the average score calculated by Python?"

His grade is calculated as the average of five test scores, which are 70, 95, 88, 90, and 78. By calculating the average, we see that he has a score of 84.2.
