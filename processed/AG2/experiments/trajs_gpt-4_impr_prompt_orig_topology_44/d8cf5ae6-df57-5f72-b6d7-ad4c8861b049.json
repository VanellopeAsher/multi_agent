  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA farmer is buying feed for his horses.

The total weight of the sugar cubes is 2 * 1 (since each box is 1 pound)\n2. The total weight of the carrots is 4 * 12 (each bag is 12 pounds)\n3. The total weight of hay is 42 * 75 (each bale is 75 pounds)\n4. The total weight of oats is 20 * 65 (each sack is 65 pounds)"

      "content": "Great. Let's perform a quick validation.\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n\n1. Sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds\n2. Carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds\n3. Hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds\n4. Oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds\n\nSumming these gives: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds\n\nTherefore, the total weight that needs to be transported is 4500 pounds. Since the farmer needs to make 2 trips, each trip should carry half of the total weight. And 4500 / 2 gives = 2250 pounds.\n\nSo our answer is valid. Finally, the answer is that the farmer's truck can carry \\boxed{2250} pounds at a time."
