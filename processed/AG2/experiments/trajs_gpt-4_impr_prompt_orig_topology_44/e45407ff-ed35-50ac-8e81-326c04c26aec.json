Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  The alcohol content of cognac is 15% stronger than scotch.  How much does he spend on everything?"

      "content": "Let's break down the problem.\n\n- The price of a bottle of scotch is $60 ($600/10).\n- John buys 2 bottles of cognac for each bottle of scotch, giving us 2*10 = 20 bottles of cognac.\n- The price of a bottle of cognac is 50% higher than the cost of a bottle of Scotch. Let's denote it as `Cognac = 1.5 * Scotch`.\n\nWith this information, we can calculate the amount John spent on cognac and add it to the amount spent on scotch to get the total amount John spent.\n\nHere is the python code to calculate the amount spent:\n\n```python\n# Calculate number of bottles of cognac\nnum_cognac = 2 * 10\n\n# Calculate price of a bottle of scotch\nprice_scotch = 600 / 10\n\n# Calculate price of a bottle of cognac\nprice_cognac = 1.5 * price_scotch\n\n# Calculate total amount spent on cognac\ntotal_cognac = num_cognac * price_cognac\n\n# Calculate total amount spent on scotch and cognac\ntotal_spent = 600 + total_cognac\n\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nNote: The problem statement mentions that the alcohol content of cognac is 15% stronger than scotch, but this information is not necessary for solving the problem as the problem asks about the total amount John spent, not the amount of alcohol he bought."
