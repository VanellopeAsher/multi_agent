Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOf the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic.

We have successfully simplified the fraction. \n\nSo, based on the calculations, approximately \\boxed{\\frac{80}{3}} percent of the cars currently available for rent are semi-automatic. \n\nLet's quickly verify our solution:\n\nWe started with 12 automatic cars, 4 manual cars, and 4 semi-automatic cars. This totals to 20 cars in the fleet. Currently, 3 automatic cars are rented out and 2 manual cars are under maintenance. So, we have 9 automatic cars, 2 manual cars, and 4 semi-automatic cars for a total of 15 available cars. \n\nThe asked percentage is for semi-automatic cars and we have 4 semi-automatic cars out of 15 available cars. Therefore, the fraction of semi-automatic cars/available cars = 4 / 15. Converting this fraction to percentage and simplifying gives us \\frac{80}{3} percent.\n\nThis verification confirms that our calculations are correct."
