Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nRobert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy and 2 halloween toys after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?"

      "content": "This is a simple math problem and can be solved directly using Python code. \n\nRobert, Cindy, and Aaron pool their candy together and then split the total amount evenly among the three of them. \n\n1. We need to first add up the total weight of the candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have. \n\n2. Then, we divide this total weight by three, as the candy is to be shared equally between the three of them.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total weight of the candy\ntotal_candy = 3 + 5 + 4 # Robert's + Cindy's + Aaron's candy\n\n# Calculate the amount of candy that each child will get\ncandy_per_child = total_candy / 3\n\n# Display the result using the print function\nprint(candy_per_child)\n```\nThis code will compute the weight of candy each child will receive after pooling and equally distributing all the candy among them."
