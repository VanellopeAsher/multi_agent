Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50.

They started with 19 bandages initially, ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages on the first day, and ordered two more bulk packs (a total of 100 bandages) on the third day.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the remaining bandages (78) from the total number of bandages. This will give us the number of bandages used over the three days.\n\nStep 3: Knowing they used ten fewer bandages on the second day than the first day, and half a pack (25) on the third day, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of bandages used on the first day.\n\nSo let's write Python code to do these calculations."

      "content": "Alright, the calculation shows us that the nurses used 38 bandages on the first day.\n\nTo verify this:\n- On the first day, they used 38 bandages.\n- On the second day, they used 10 less, which makes it 28 bandages.\n- And on the third day, they used half a pack i.e., 25 bandages. \n\nTherefore, the total number of bandages used over the three days is 38 (day 1) + 28 (day 2) + 25 (day 3)  = 91 bandages.\n\nWe know from the problem that they started with 19 bandages, ordered one pack of 50 bandages on the first day, and then ordered two more packs of 50 bandages each on the third day, giving them a total of 19 (initial) + 50 (first day order) + 100 (third day order) = 169 bandages\n\nSubtracting the total number of bandages used (91) from the total number of all bandages (169), we get 78 – which is the number of bandages left at the end of the third day as per the problem. So, our calculations appear to be correct.\n\nSo, the nurses used \\boxed{38} bandages on the first day.\n"
