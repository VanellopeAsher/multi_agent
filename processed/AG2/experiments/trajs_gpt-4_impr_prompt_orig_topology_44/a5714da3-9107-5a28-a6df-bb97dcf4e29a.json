Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nScarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.  At the pet store, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each and 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece.  She bought 20 fish and she needed fish food that cost $2.00.  How much did she spend?"

      "content": "Key Idea: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Scarlett bought.\n\nLet's allocate a variable for each item's cost:\n\n1. `aquarium_cost` = $10.00\n2. `rock_cost_per_bag` = $2.50\n3. `coral_cost_per_piece` = $2.00\n4. `fish_count` = 20 (the problem didn't mention the cost per fish, so we'll assume here that it's free)\n5. `fish_food_cost` = $2.00\n\nThe total cost Scarlett spent can be calculated by the following formula:\n\n`total_cost = aquarium_cost + rock_cost_per_bag * 2 + coral_cost_per_piece * 3 + fish_food_cost`\n\nLet's compute this in Python.\n\n```python\n# define the cost for each item\naquarium_cost = 10.00\nrock_cost_per_bag = 2.50\ncoral_cost_per_piece = 2.00\nfish_food_cost = 2.00\n\n# compute the total cost\ntotal_cost = aquarium_cost + rock_cost_per_bag * 2 + coral_cost_per_piece * 3 + fish_food_cost\n\n# print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```"

The aquarium cost: $10.00\n2. 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each: $2.50 * 2 = $5.00\n3. 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each: $2.00 * 3 = $6.00\n4. Fish food cost: $2.00\n\nIf we add these costs, we get $10.00 (aquarium cost) + $5.00 (rock cost) + $6.00 (coral cost) + $2.00 (fish food cost) = $23.00\n\nThe result obtained is consistent with the calculations, and thus, it can be considered correct.\n\nSo, Scarlett spent a total amount of $23.00.\n\nThe final calculation results in \\boxed{23}."
