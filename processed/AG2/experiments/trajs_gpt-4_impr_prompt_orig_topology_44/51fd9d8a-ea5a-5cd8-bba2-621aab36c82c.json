Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 0.1 times of one thousand years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 0.1 times of one hundred years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age."

P + PA + J = 0.1*1000 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 0.1 times of one thousand years old)\n2. PA = J + 0.1*100 (Paul is 0.1 times of one hundred years older than John)\n3. P = PA + J (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)\n\nLet's express these equations in code and solve. \n\nWe can use the sympy module, which provides the solve() function to solve sy  s of equations. Attached is the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nP, PA, J = symbols('P PA J') # To represent Peter, Paul and John's ages\n\n# Defining the equations\neq1 = Eq(P + PA + J, 0.1*1000) \neq2 = Eq(PA, J + 0.1*100)\neq3 = Eq(P, PA + J)\n\n# Solving the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1,eq2,eq3), (P, PA, J))\n\nprint(\"Peter's Age: \", solution[P])\nprint(\"Paul's Age: \", solution[PA])\nprint(\"John's Age: \", solution[J])\n```\n\nWhat is the result of this code execution?"

Add them all: 50 + 30 + 20 = 100 years, which is 0.1 times of one thousand years old, as stated by the problem. This satisfies the first condition.\n2. Paul is reportedly 0.1 times of one hundred years older than John. This implies Paul should be 10 years older than John. Paul's age is 30 years and John's age is 20 years, thus Paul is in fact 10 years older than John. This satisfies the second condition.\n3. Finally, Peter’s age is reported to be the sum of Paul and John's ages. Given Peter’s reported age is 50 years, and the sum of Paul and John's ages is 30 + 20 = 50 years, the third condition is satisfied as well.\n\nAfter evaluating all the conditions given in the problem, it can be seen that the obtained ages comply with all the requirements.\n\nSo, Peter's age is-boxed{50} years old."
