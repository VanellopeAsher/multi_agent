      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

      "content": "Let's start by calculating the age of each sibling:\n\n- The sisters are all the same age, which is 1.6 times ten. So each sister's age = 1.6 * 10\n- The younger brother is 3/5 of 20 years old. So younger brother's age = (3/5) * 20\n- The older brother's age is twice that of the younger brother. So older brother's age = 2 * younger brother's age\n\nSubsequently, we sum up the ages of all the siblings to get the total age.\n\nHere is the Python code which performs these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define sisters', younger brother's and older brother's ages\nsister_age = 1.6 * 10\nyounger_brother_age = 3/5 * 20\nolder_brother_age = 2 * younger_brother_age\n\n# calculate the total age\ntotal_age = 3 * sister_age + younger_brother_age + older_brother_age\n\n# display the result\nprint(total_age)\n```"

Since there are 3 sisters, their total age is $3 \\times 16 = 48$ years.\n- The younger brother is $3/5 \\times 20 = 12$ years old.\n- The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so he is $2 \\times 12 = 24$ years old.\n\nWhen we sum up these ages, we get $48 + 12 + 24 = 84$ years, which matches the calculation done by the Python program.\n\nSo the total age of these five siblings is \\boxed{84} years."
