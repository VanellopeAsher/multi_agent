Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 3 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?"

      "content": "Key Idea:\nSince John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes and the time taken for an extreme Sudoku puzzle is given, we can find out the number of bottles by finding out how many half-hour intervals are in the time taken for an extreme Sudoku puzzle.\n\nApproach: \n1. Calculate the time taken for an extreme Sudoku puzzle in minutes. \n2. Translate that time into half-hour intervals (one bottle of water is drunk per half-hour interval).\n3. Give the result as the number of bottles drunk.\n\nHere is the Python code for this calculation:\n\n```python\n# time for normal sudoku in minutes\nnormal_sudoku_time = 30  \n\n# time for extreme sudoku in minutes\nextreme_sudoku_time = 3 * normal_sudoku_time  \n\n# number of half-hour intervals in the time for extreme sudoku\nnum_intervals = extreme_sudoku_time / normal_sudoku_time  \n\n# number of bottles drunk is the same as the number of half-hour intervals\nnum_bottles = num_intervals  \n\nprint(num_bottles)\n```\n\nThis program calculates the time for an extreme Sudoku and then divides that time by 30 (indicating how many half hour intervals are there in the extreme Sudoku time). The quotient gives the number of bottles drunk."

A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes which means he drinks 1 bottle per puzzle.\n3. An extreme Sudoku takes 3 times as long as a normal Sudoku, meaning it takes 90 minutes.\n4. Since John drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, he would drink 3 bottles during the 90 minutes it takes to complete an extreme Sudoku.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that our solution is correct.\n\nFinal Answer:  John drinks \boxed{3} bottles of water while completing an extreme Sudoku puzzle."
