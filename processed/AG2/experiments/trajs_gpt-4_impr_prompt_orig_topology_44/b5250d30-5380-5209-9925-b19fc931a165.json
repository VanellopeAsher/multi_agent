Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery Saturday, Jill along with her companions view 4 films and on Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays. If this routine is followed every weekend, what is the total number of films they can view in a span of 4 weeks?"

On Sunday, half as many films as on Saturday are watched. \n\nTherefore, the total movies watched on one weekend (Saturday + Sunday) would be:\n\n```python\ntotal_movies_per_weekend = 4 + 4 / 2\n```\nThen, to calculate the total movies watched in 4 weeks, we multiply `total_movies_per_weekend` by 4:\n\n```python\ntotal_movies_four_weeks = total_movies_per_weekend * 4\n```\n\nLet's calculate using Python:"

Going by the problem-solving approach detailed above, we have executed the Python code directly to find the solution. \n\nWe calculated the number of films viewed in a weekend, which came out as 6 (4 films on Saturday and 2 films on Sunday, which is half of Saturday). \n\nThen, we found out the total number of films they can watch in 4 weeks. Since there are 4 weekends in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of films in one weekend by 4. \n\nHence, the total number of films they can watch in a span of 4 weeks is 24 (6 films per weekend * 4 weekends). \n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{24}."
