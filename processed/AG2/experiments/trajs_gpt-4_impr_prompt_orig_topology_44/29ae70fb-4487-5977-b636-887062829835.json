Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $60.

We could accomplish this by dividing the total cost by the price per class and rounding down to the nearest whole number (as he can't attend a fraction of a class).\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# define the cost of karate classes and the limit per class\ntotal_cost_karate = 60\ncost_limit_per_class = 10\n\n# calculate number of classes he can attend\nmax_classes = math.floor(total_cost_karate / cost_limit_per_class)\n\n# calculate number of classes he can miss\ntotal_classes = 10\nmissed_classes = total_classes - max_classes\n\nprint(missed_classes)\n```\n\nWhat is the total cost of the Karate class, the maximum cost per class that his parents allow, and the total number of planned Karate classes respectively?"

We can already use the existing values from the problem statement: the total cost of Karate class is $60, the cost limit per class set by his parents is $10, and the total number of planned Karate classes is 10.\n\nSo, let's proceed and put these values in our code to find the number of classes Manny can miss:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# given values\ntotal_cost_karate = 60\ncost_limit_per_class = 10\ntotal_classes = 10\n\n# calculate number of classes he can attend \nmax_classes = math.floor(total_cost_karate / cost_limit_per_class)\n\n# calculate number of classes he can miss\nmissed_classes = total_classes - max_classes\n\nprint(missed_classes)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, we find that Manny can miss \\boxed{4} classes. If he misses more than that, the price per class will exceed $10, and his parents won't sign him up again."

We know that the total cost of the karate class is $60, and Manny's parents have stated that each class should cost no more than $10. With those figures, we know that Manny must attend at least 6 classes ($60 / $10 = 6) for the class to be worth the price.\n\nTherefore, out of 10 total classes, Manny can afford to miss 4 classes (10 - 6 = 4) before the cost per class exceeds what his parents are willing to pay. In essence, if Manny misses 5 or more classes, it would mean each remaining class has cost more than $10 on average.\n\nSo, the amount of classes Manny can miss before they don't sign him up again is \\boxed{4}."
