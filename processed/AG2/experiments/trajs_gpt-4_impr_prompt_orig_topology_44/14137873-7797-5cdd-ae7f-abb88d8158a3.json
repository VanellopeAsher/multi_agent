Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nDave purchased a big packet of french fries and consumed fourteen before a ravenous seagull snatched the packet from his grasp.

So, the total fries were 6 before ant took it.\n- Before the raccoon pilfered the fries, the total should be three times the amount left after the raccoon.\n- Then add the fries that the pigeons ate (3 pigeons * 3 fries/pigeon).\n- Double this total to account for the fries the seagull ate.\n- Finally, add the fries that Dave ate to find the total number of fries in the packet originally.\n\nThe first two steps (calculations involving the ant and raccoon) appear to be correct, resulting in 18 fries before the pigeons. The calculation involving the pigeons should increase this number to 27. Following that logic, the seagull should have doubled the amount to 54, which doesn't match the expected result of 43. The final count, after adding the fries Dave ate, results in 68 instead of the expected 54.\n\nThe problem appears to be in the fourth step: the seagull consumed half the number of fries that Dave originally ate, which is 7 fries, not half the quantity before the seagull. So, we don't need to double the total at this point.\n\nSo, the fourth step should be: add the fries that the seagull ate (half the quantity that Dave ate) to the fries_before_pigeons. \n\nLet's use this revised approach to solve the problem."
