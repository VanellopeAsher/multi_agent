Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

Calculate the length of each cut after the ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts.\n3. Calculate the length of each final cut after each part is cut again into 5 equal parts.\n4. Print the value of each final cut. \n\nWe can use the sympy library in Python to declare our symbols and perform our calculations. Let's write a Python program to solve this.\n\n```python\n# import sympy library\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Declare the variable\nL = symbols('L')\n\n# Cut the ribbon into 4 equal parts\ncut1 = L / 4\n\n# Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts\nfinal_cut = simplify(cut1 / 5)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(final_cut)\n```\nThe variable \b'L' in the code represents the original length of the ribbon and 'final_cut' represents the final length of each cut after the ribbon is cut into 4 parts each further cut into 5 parts."

The length of each final cut will be L/20, where L is the original length of the ribbon.\n\nLet's verify this by considering an example. Suppose the total length of the ribbon is 20 units. First, if we divide the ribbon into four equal parts, each part would be 20/4 = 5 units long. Then these parts are each cut into 5 equal parts, so each of these would be 5/5 = 1 unit long. This matches our solution of L/20 when L=20.\n\nHence, our final answer is box{L/20} for the length of each part after the final cut where L is the total length of the ribbon."
