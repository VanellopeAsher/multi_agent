Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

The first aircraft flies 3/4 of its total flights to Greece, with the remaining flights evenly split between France and Germany.\n2. The second aircraft's flights, numbered at 44, represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft.\n\nWe can employ algebra to find a solution. Let's denote the total number of flights by the first aircraft as x. From the information provided, we can formulate the equation 1/2 * x = 44, which lets us calculate x. Once we know x, we can calculate the number of flights to France as 1/2 * (1 - 3/4)x. \n\nNow  let's implement this in Python."

The total number of daily flights by the first aircraft is twice the number of flights by the second aircraft. So, the first aircraft makes 44*2 = 88 daily flights.\n\n2. These 88 flights are divided such that 3/4 go to Greece (which makes 66 flights), and the remaining 1/4 are evenly split between France and Germany.
