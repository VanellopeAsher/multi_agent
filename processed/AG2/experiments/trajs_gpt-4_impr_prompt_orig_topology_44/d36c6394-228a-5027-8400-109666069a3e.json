Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \n48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. However, before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

      "content": "This problem involves two main steps. The first step is to calculate the number of people on the bus after the first stop. The second step is to calculate the number of people on the bus after the second stop. \n\nGiven:\n- Initial number of bus passengers: 48\n- Number of passengers who leave the bus at the first stop: 8\n- Number of passengers who join the bus is 5 times the number of passengers who left at the first stop\n- Number of passengers who leave the bus again at the first stop: 2\n- Number of passengers who leave the bus at the second stop: 21\n- Number of passengers who join the bus at the second stop is 3 times less the number of passengers who left the bus at the second stop.\n\nSteps:\n- After the first stop: The number of people on the bus is the initial number, minus those who got off, plus those who got on, minus those who got off again. \n- After the second stop: The number of people on the bus is the number from after the first stop, minus those who got off, plus those who got on.\n\nLet's calculate the final number of passengers\n\n```python\n# initial number of passengers\ninitial_passengers = 48\n\n# passengers activity at the first stop\nfirst_out = 8\nfirst_in = 5 * first_out\nfinal_first_out = 2\n\n# passengers activity at the second stop\nsecond_out = 21\nsecond_in = second_out // 3\n\n# number of passengers after the first stop\npassengers_after_first = initial_passengers - first_out + first_in - final_first_out\n\n# number of passengers after the second stop\npassengers_after_second = passengers_after_first - second_out + second_in\n\nprint(passengers_after_second)\n```"

      "content": "Perfect, it seems you have arrived at the correct answer. \n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.\n2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and then 5 times that number (40) get on, so we have 40 + 48 - 8 = 80. But before the bus leaves, 2 passengers get off, so the total number of passengers after the first stop is 80 - 2 = 78. \n3. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off the bus and then 21/3 = 7 passengers get on. So the total number of passengers after the second stop is 78 - 21 + 7 = 64. \n\nFinal verification and answer presentation: Upon running the python script, it is confirmed that the number of passengers remaining on the bus after the second stop is indeed \\boxed{64}."
