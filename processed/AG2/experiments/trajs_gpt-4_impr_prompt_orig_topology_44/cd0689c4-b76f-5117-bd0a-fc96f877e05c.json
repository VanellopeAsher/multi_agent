Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows. She has 6 presents for her family members, 4 presents for her buddies, and 2 presents for her educators. She possesses 144 inches of ribbon for this task. What is the length in inches of ribbon that she can allocate for each present's bow?"

      "content": "This is a problem of simple arithmetic, where you are required to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of presents that require a bow.\n\nLet's allocate a constant amount of ribbon to each present's bow.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach: Direct Python Solution.\n\nThe total number of presents is the sum of presents for family, friends, and teachers. Let's calculate the total number of presents first using Python.\n\nHere's the Python code for finding the total number of presents:\n\n```python\n# total number of presents\ntotal_presents = 6 + 4 + 2\n\nprint(total_presents)\n```\n\nOnce we have the total number of presents, we will find out the length of the ribbon each present can get. For this, we will divide the total length of the ribbon (in inches) by the total number of presents.\n\nHere's the Python code to find out allocation for each present:\n\n```python\n# total length of ribbon in inches\ntotal_ribbon_length = 144\n\n# length each present gets\neach_present_length = total_ribbon_length / total_presents\n\nprint(each_present_length)\n```\n\nTherefore, the length in inches of ribbon that Monica can allocate for each present's bow can be found by running the above Python code."

      "content": "Based on the input, we have 12 total presents and each present gets 12 inches of ribbon. \n\nSo, the length in inches of ribbon that Monica can allocate for each present's bow is 12 inches.\n\nVerification Steps:\n1. The total number of presents is correct as it is the sum of all the presents which we calculated as 12.\n2. The length of ribbon each present gets is obtained correctly by dividing the total length of ribbon by the total number of presents.\n3. Hence, the final answer is correct and verified.\n\nTherefore, the length in inches of ribbon that Monica can allocate for each present's bow is \\boxed{12} inches."
