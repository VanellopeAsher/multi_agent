      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMartha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 12 families with 6 people and 15 families with 4 people. 16 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?"

      "content": "This problem requires us to calculate the total number of people who showed up at Martha's party. To solve it, we must:\n\n1. Compute the total number of people that Martha invited initially.\n2. Determine the total number of people that couldn't come due to illness or previous commitments.\n3. Subtract the number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of invitees to get the final number of attendees.\n\nLet's do this step by step.\n\nInitial number of people:\n```python\n# number of families with 6 members each\nfamilies_six = 12 \nmembers_per_family_six = 6\n\n# number of families with 4 members each\nfamilies_four = 15 \nmembers_per_family_four = 4\n\ntotal_invited = (families_six * members_per_family_six) + (families_four * members_per_family_four)\n```\n\nNext, we will calculate the total number of people that couldn't attend the party:\n\n```python\n# number of people who couldn't show up due to illness\nillness = 16 \n\n# a quarter of the people who were ill had prior commitments\nprior_commitments = illness / 4 \n\ntotal_absent = illness + prior_commitments\n```\n\nFinally, we will calculate the number of people who showed up at the party by subtracting the total number of absentees from the total number of people invited:\n\n```python\n# total number of people that showed up\ntotal_present = total_invited - total_absent\nprint(total_present)\n```"
