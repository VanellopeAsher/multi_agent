      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her and donated $15 to a local charity. How much money does she have left from her earnings?"

Compute Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.\n2. Compute the total amount Suzanne gave to her sisters.\n3. Subtract the amount given to her sisters and the amount donated to charity from Suzanne's total earnings.\n\nLet's write Python code to perform these calculations."

Verify the earnings from the cookies: It should be \\$1 * 80 = \\$80.\n2. Verify the earnings from the cupcakes: It should be \\$4 * 60 = \\$240.\n3. Add the earnings from the cookies and cupcakes: The result should be \\$80 + \\$240 = \\$320.\n4. Calculate the total money given to the sisters: It should be \\$10 * 2 = \\$20.\n5. Calculate the total deductions: It should be \\$20 (sisters) + \\$15 (charity) = \\$35.\n6. Subtract the total deductions from the total earnings: The result should be \\$320 (earnings) - \\$35 (deductions) = \\$285.\n\nThe final result of \\$285 is expected according to the above verification steps."
