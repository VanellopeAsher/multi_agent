Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. Miss Maria is going to give her sister Jane 10 cards, but Jane refuses. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?"

She has six decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck and five boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box. \n\nNext, we subtract the 50 cards that she kept for herself.\n\nFinally, we divide the remaining number of cards by ten to determine the number of students. Each student received 10 cards. \n\nThis can be calculated directly with Python. Here is the python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# initial cards\ndeck_cards = 25\nbasket_ball_decks = 6\nbase_ball_boxes = 40\nbase_ball_cards_boxes = 5\n# Ms. Maria kept 50 cards\nms_maria_kept = 50\n# Each student receive 10 cards\ncards_per_student = 10\n\n# Total cards Ms. Maria have\ntotal_cards = (deck_cards * basket_ball_decks) + (base_ball_boxes * base_ball_cards_boxes)\n\n# Remaining cards after Ms. Maria kept 50 cards\nremaining_cards = total_cards - ms_maria_kept\n\n# Number of students\nstudents = remaining_cards / cards_per_student\n```\nWe now just need to print the `students` variable to find out how many students Miss Maria has. \n\n```python\nprint(students)\n```"

Here's the correct step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has: 6 decks x 25 cards/deck = 150 cards.\n2. Add the total number of baseball cards she has: 5 boxes x 40 cards/box = 200 cards.\n3. Add the number of basketball and baseball cards to get the total: 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards.\n4. Subtract the 50 cards that Miss Maria kept: 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards.\n5. Finally, divide the remaining cards by the 10 cards given to each student: 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students.\n\nTherefore, Miss Maria has \\boxed{30} students."
