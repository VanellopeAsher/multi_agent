Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIf 60 potatoes makes 360 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 960 potatoes?"

      "content": "First, we can calculate the amount of hash browns that one potato can make by dividing the total number of hash browns (360) by the total number of potatoes used (60). Afterward, we can multiply this value by the number of potatoes we have (960) to find out the amount of hash browns we can make.\n\nHere's the Python script:\n\n```python\n# define the quantities of potatoes and hash browns in the first case\npotatoes_1 = 60\nhash_browns_1 = 360\n\n# calculate the amount of hash browns one potato can make\nhash_brown_per_potato = hash_browns_1 / potatoes_1\n\n# define the number of available potatoes in the second case\npotatoes_2 = 960\n\n# calculate the amount of hash browns we can make in the second case\nhash_browns_2 = hash_brown_per_potato * potatoes_2\n\n# output the result\nprint(hash_browns_2)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the result."

In the first scenario, we have 60 potatoes and they make 360 hash browns. So, the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 60:360, which simplifies to 1:6.\n2. In the second scenario, we have 960 potatoes. If we maintain the same ratio of 1:6 as the first scenario, we would indeed have 960 * 6 = 5760 hash browns.\n3. This matches with the output of our Python script, so it seems we have made the right calculations.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{5760}."
