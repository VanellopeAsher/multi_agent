Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe Easter egg hunt team hid some eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?"

We are told that all the rest of the eggs, except for 10, were found by their friends. \n\n```python\n# defining the number of eggs each twin found\neggs_each_twin_found = 30\n\n# calculating the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins\ntotal_eggs_twins_found = 2 * eggs_each_twin_found\n\n# defining the number of eggs that were not found\neggs_not_found = 10\n\n# calculating the total number of eggs hid by the team\ntotal_eggs_hid = total_eggs_twins_found + eggs_not_found\n\n# calculating the number of eggs found by the friends by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins and the ones not found from the total  number of eggs hid by the team\neggs_found_by_friends = total_eggs_hid - total_eggs_twins_found - eggs_not_found\n\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends)\n```\nThe program execution will give us the number of eggs found by the friends."

      "content": "It appears that there was some misunderstanding. In the problem, it is said that each of the Smith twins found 30 eggs. This means the twins combined found 30*2=60 eggs. Furthermore, it's specified that all the other eggs except 10 were found by the friends. The statement doesn't mention any eggs remaning hidden or not found, which means all of the eggs, including the 10, were found. \n\nTherefore, using direct Python solution approach, we can correct the equation accordingly:\n\n```python\n# defining the number of eggs each twin found\neggs_each_twin_found = 30\n\n# calculating the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins\ntotal_eggs_twins_found = 2 * eggs_each_twin_found\n\n# we can assume that the 10 leftover eggs were also found by the friends\neggs_leftover = 10\n\n# calculating the number of eggs found by the friends by adding the leftover eggs to \n# the total number of eggs found subtracted by the number of eggs that twins found  \neggs_found_by_friends = total_eggs_twins_found + eggs_leftover - total_eggs_twins_found\n\nprint(eggs_found_by_friends)\n```\nLet's execute the program now."
