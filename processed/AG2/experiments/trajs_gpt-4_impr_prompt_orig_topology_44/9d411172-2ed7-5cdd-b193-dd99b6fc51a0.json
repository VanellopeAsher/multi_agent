Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nManny signed up for Karate classes for $80. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $20 per class, then they won't sign him up again.

This is achieved by dividing the total cost of the classes by the maximum cost per class his parents are willing to pay. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the variables\ntotal_cost = 80  # Total cost of Karate classes\nmax_cost_per_class = 20  # Maximum cost per class\n\n# The number of classes Manny has to attend before the cost per class exceeds $20\nclasses_to_attend = total_cost / max_cost_per_class\n\nclasses_to_attend = int(classes_to_attend)  # Converting it to an integer as the number of classes cannot be a fraction\n\n# Given 12 total classes, so the classes he can miss will be \nclasses_he_can_miss = 12 - classes_to_attend\n\nclasses_he_can_miss\n```\n\nPlease execute this and provide me with the results."

Given that his parents won't sign him up again if the classes end up costing more than $20 per class.\n3. The number of classes he has to attend before the cost per class exceeds $20 is 4 ($80/$20).\n4. Given that there are a total of 12 classes, the number of classes he can miss is calculated by subtracting the classes he has to attend from the total number of classes. So we get 12 - 4 = 8.\n5. This means Manny can miss 8 classes before the cost per class goes beyond $20 which makes his parents not to sign him up for the next session.\n\nSo the final solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss up to \\boxed{8} classes before they don't sign him up again."
