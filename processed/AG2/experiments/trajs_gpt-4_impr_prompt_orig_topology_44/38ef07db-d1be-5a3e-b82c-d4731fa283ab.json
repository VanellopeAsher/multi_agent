Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20.5 feet on the long side and 15.5 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?"

Here, the length is 20.5 feet and the width is 15.5 feet. \n\nLet's proceed with the calculation in Python.\n\n```python\n# Defining the length and width of the rectangle\nlength = 20.5\nwidth = 15.5\n\n# Calculating the perimeter of the rectangle\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(perimeter)\n```"

      "content": "Since you've received a result of 72.0, let's verify the solution.\n\n**VERIFICATION:**\n\nReconsider the original problem: we need to determine the quantity of crepe paper necessary to line the fencing of a rectangular yard. The fencing is depicted by the perimeter of the yard, which we calculated to be 72 feet. Because crepe paper length corresponds directly to the perimeter length, 72 feet of crepe paper should be necessary.\n\nAfter reviewing the problem and our process, the calculation seems to be correctly applied and the answer accurate. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 72.0 feet. \n\nJames needs to purchase exactly \\boxed{72} feet of crepe paper for his birthday party."
