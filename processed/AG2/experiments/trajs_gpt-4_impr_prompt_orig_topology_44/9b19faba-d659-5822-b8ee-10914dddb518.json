Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?"

According to the problem, on Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday, and we know that on Sunday he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, on Saturday, he sold `15 - 4 =  11` boxes of apple pie.\n\nLet's put all the data into a table for better visualization.\n\n| | Gingerbread | Apple Pie |\n|:--: | :---: | :---: |\n|Saturday | 10 | 15 - 4 = 11 |\n|Sunday | 10 + 5 = 15 | 15 |\n|Monday | 2 | 4 |\n\nNow let's write a Python program that will calculate the total earnings."

      "content": "So the result of the Python code says that Sunny earned a total of $612 over the three days.\n\nTo verify this result, we'll manually calculate the total earnings and check if they match with the result obtained from the Python code.\n\nLet's sum up:\n\n- Gingerbread: (10 boxes on Saturday + 15 boxes on Sunday + 2 boxes on Monday) = 27 boxes\n- Apple pie: (11 boxes on Saturday + 15 boxes on Sunday + 4 boxes on Monday) = 30 boxes\n\nNow we multiply the quantities by the prices:\n\n- Gingerbread: 27 boxes * $6/box = $162 \n- Apple pie: 30 boxes * $15/box = $450 \n\nThe total earnings are $162 (from gingerbread) + $450 (from apple pies), which equals $612. These calculations confirm the validity of our Python code.\n\nSo, the total amount of money Sunny earned for the three days selling gingerbread and apple pie is \\boxed{612}."
