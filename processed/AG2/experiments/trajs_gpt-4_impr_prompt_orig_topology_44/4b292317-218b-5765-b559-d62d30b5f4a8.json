Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 50 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

      "content": "Excellent, the calculation is exact. \nEach final cut will therefore be 5 millimeters long.\n\nVERIFICATION: \nThe ribbon, which is initially 10,000 millimeters long, is divided first into 40 parts, giving us parts that are 250 millimeters long each. Afterwards, each of the 250-millimeter parts is divided into 50 equal parts, leading to final cuts each measuring 5 millimeters. To verify our answer, we can multiply the length of the final cuts (5 mm) by the total number of cuts (40*50), which should be equal to the initial total length of the ribbon (10,000 mm). \n\n```python\ntotal_length_check = final_cut_length * num_parts_step1 * num_parts_step2\nprint(total_length_check)\n```\n\nShould output 10000. Once we verify this, the final length of each cut would be confirmed to be 5 mm."
