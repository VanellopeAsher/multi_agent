Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

Minimum mortgage payment = $500/month\n4. Subscription to Netflix = $15/month (offset by a coupon)\n\nShe is aiming to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts (student loan, credit card, mortgage) every month, and she continues to pay the regular amount for her Netflix subscription.\n\nWe need to find how much she pays for her debts in a year. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total minimum payment per month (which includes student loan, credit card, and mortgage payments).\n2. Multiply the total minimum payment by 1.5 to get the 50% increased payment amount.\n3. There's no need to calculate for her Netflix subscription since she has a coupon that offsets the cost.\n4. Multiply the monthly payment by 12 to get the total payment per year.\n\nLet's do the calculation:"

The minimum per month on her debts: student loan ($300) + credit card ($200) + mortgage ($500) = $1000\n2. The increased payment per month: $1000 * 1.5 = $1500\n3.
