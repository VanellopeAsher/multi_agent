Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses. How many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi each time?"

      "content": "Great, the output is as expected. \n\nBased on the computation, there are 14 mL of one type of medicine in each dose. \n\n## VERIFICATION\nLet's make sure the answer makes sense.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n1. Saanvi has to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.\n2. There are 8 doses from 448mL of medicine.\n\nSo, for one dose, we calculate to have 448 mL / 8 = 56 mL of medicine total.\n\nIf we let x be the amount of the first type of medicine, then, according to the problem, 3x would be the amount of the second type of medicine. \n\nSo, we have x + 3x = 56 mL, which implies that 4x = 56 mL, then x = 56 mL / 4 = 14 mL.\n\nOur solution matches the verification process, and hence, can be trusted. \n\nTherefore, each dose contains 14 mL of one medicine.\n\nHence, the answer is \\boxed{14}."
