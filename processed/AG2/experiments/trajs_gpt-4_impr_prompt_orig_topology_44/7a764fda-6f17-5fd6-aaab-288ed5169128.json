Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn November, a toy was $4000. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?"

Calculate the decreased price in January based on the increased price in December.\n\nLet's write python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Given data\ninitial_price = 4000\ndec_increase_percent = 80\njan_decrease_percent = 50\n\n# Calculate the increased price in December\ndec_increase_value = initial_price * (dec_increase_percent / 100)\ndec_price = initial_price + dec_increase_value\n\n# Calculate the decreased price in January\njan_decrease_value = dec_price * (jan_decrease_percent / 100)\njan_price = dec_price - jan_decrease_value\n\nprint(f\"The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is: {jan_price}\")\n```\n\nThe above Python code snippet calculates the price of the toy after it was discounted in January. It first calculates the price increase in December by multiplying the initial price by the increase percentage divided by 100, then adds that to the initial price to get the new price in December. It then calculates the price decrease in January by multiplying the December price by the decrease percentage divided by 100, and subtracts that from the December price to get the final price in January.\n"

In December, the price increased by 80%, which is 3200 (i.e., 80/100 * 4000). So, the December price is 4000+3200=7200\n3. In January, there is a decrease of 50%, which is 3600 (i.e., 50/100 * 7200). So, the January price is 7200-3600=3600\n\nThe calculation seems correct.\n\nAnswer: The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \\$3600.\n\nIn the provided format, the answer is \boxed{3600}. \nOnly the numerical part is present inside so it adheres to the requirements."
