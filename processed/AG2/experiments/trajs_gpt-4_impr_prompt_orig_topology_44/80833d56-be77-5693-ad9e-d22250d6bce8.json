Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 100 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved using basic calculation and logic.\n\nStep-by-Step Process:\n1. Understand what is given in the problem. Based on the details, John runs for 10 hours the first day and half as much on the other two days. Therefore, he runs for a total of 10 + 2*(10/2) = 20 hours a week.\n2. To find out how fast he runs, we need to divide distance by time. In this case, he runs a total of 100 miles and spends 20 hours running.\n3. Use Python to solve the equation 100/20.\n\nLet's write the python program for the following calculation.\n\n```python\ntotal_miles = 100\ntotal_hours = 20\nspeed = total_miles / total_hours\nspeed\n```"

He runs for 10 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Therefore, he runs for a total of 20 hours a week.\nStep 3:  I performed the calculation to find out his speed by dividing total miles by total hours (which is 100/20) and got the result as 5.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the speed at which he runs is 5 miles per hour.\n\nHence, the final answer after verification process is \\boxed{5}."
