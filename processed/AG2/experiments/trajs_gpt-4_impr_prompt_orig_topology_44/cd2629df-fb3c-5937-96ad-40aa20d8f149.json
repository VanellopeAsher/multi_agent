      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To make things more interesting, he decided to pay her back in a unique way. For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month. On the twelfth month, he will pay the remaining amount, including the interest, and also plans to buy a coin worth $100.

Calculate how much Stephen has paid his sister in 11 months.\n3. The amount Stephen still has to pay his sister after 11 months is the initial amount minus what have been paid in 11 months.\n4.

That's the borrowed amount plus the 2% interest.\n\nHere's the Python code for that:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial borrowed amount\nborrowed_amount = 300\n\n# Calculate the total amount Stephen owes initially\ntotal_amount_initially = borrowed_amount + 0.02 * borrowed_amount\nprint(total_amount_initially)\n```\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Stephen has paid his sister in 11 months:\n\n```python\n# Define the monthly payment Stephen gives to his sister\nmonthly_payment = 25\n\n# Calculate the total amount Stephen has paid in 11 months\ntotal_paid_in_11_months = monthly_payment * 11\nprint(total_paid_in_11_months)\n```\n\nThen we compute the remaining amount to be paid in the 12th month, before the coin purchase:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the remaining amount Stephen is due to pay\nremaining_amount = total_amount_initially - total_paid_in_11_months\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nAll these codes together can be written in a Python program to calculate the required answer.

So, the final payment to his sister will be the remaining_amount - cost of the coin.\n\nBut since we were explicitly asked by the problem to exclude the coin purchases for the 12th month, we don't have to do this step.\n\nSo, Stephen wil pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases.\n\nOur final answer is then $31."
