Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room. He'd dumped a lego boxed set on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the first one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.

Thus, regardless of the number of blocks in the first box, we can conclude that Johnny picks up exactly 17*X/4 blocks in total.\n\nVerification: \n\nIf the first box contains X blocks:\n\n- Johnny picks up X blocks from the first box.\n- He picks up 3*X blocks from the second box.\n- He picks up X/4 blocks from the third box. \n\nAdding these quantities together, we have X + 3*X + X/4 = 17*X/4 blocks in total. Therefore, the equation derived correctly represents the total number of blocks Johnny picks up.\n\nGiven the number of blocks in the first box, we can now ascertain the total number of blocks Johnny picks up by substituting X into the equation. However, because the problem doesn't provide a specific number for X, we can't compute an actual numerical answer. \n\nConclusively, if X represents the number of blocks in the first box, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is represented by \\boxed{17X/4}."
