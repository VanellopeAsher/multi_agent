Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.

      "content": "This problem involves various operations like multiplication and division. \n\nHere is a plan on how we can solve this:\n1. Each box of crayons has 64 crayons and Kate got 3 boxes. Therefore, multiply 64 by 3 to get the total number of crawons she got.\n2. To make a crayon muffin, she melts 8 pieces together. Therefore, divide the total number of small crayon pieces by 8 to get the total number of crayon muffins she made.\n3. She sold all her crayon muffins and made $36. Therefore, to find out how much each  crayon muffin costs, divide the total amount she made ($36) by the total number of crayon muffins.\n\nLet's Python solve it! Note, I will use '//' operator for division to get the quotient as integer.\n\n```python\n# number of boxes of crayons she got\nboxes = 3\n# the number of crayons in each box\ncrayons_in_each_box = 64\n\n# the total number of crayons\ntotal_crayons = boxes * crayons_in_each_box\n\n# the number of pieces required to make a crayon muffin\npieces = 8\n\n# the total number of crayon muffins she made is total_crayons // pieces\ntotal_muffins = total_crayons // pieces\n\n# the total amount she made\ntotal_amount = 36\n\n# how much each crayon muffin costs is the total amount she made divided by the total number of muffin crayons she made\nmuffin_price = total_amount / total_muffins\n\nprint(muffin_price)\n```\n   \n\nPlease run this Python code and provide the output."

Thus, she has a total of 192 (3 * 64) crayon pieces.\n2. Recalling that each crayon muffin is made from 8 pieces, she can make a total of 24 (192 / 8) crayon muffins.\n3. After selling all 24 muffins, Kate makes a total of $36. Therefore, dividing $36 by the 24 muffins yields a sale price of $1.5 per muffin.\n\nGiven that all the verification steps have been successfully passed, I am confident in reporting that the sales price of each crayon muffin is  \\$1.5. Hence, the final result is boxed{}, which only contains digits.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1.5}."
