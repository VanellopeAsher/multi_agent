Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "Given the problem statement:\n\n1. Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.\n2. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son.\n\nLet's denote the following:\n\n1. Let's denote C (Carver's age), D (Daughter's age), and S (Son's age).\n2. According to the problem statement we can write the following equations: \n\n- C = 2D - 5   # Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.\n- D = 3S + 4   # The daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of the son.\n\nAlso, we know that Carver's age (C) is given as 45. So, using these data we can write a system of equations to solve for D and S. Attached is the Python code solution to solve these equations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nC, D, S = symbols('C D S')\n\n# equation 1: C = 2D - 5\n# equation 2: D = 3S + 4\n# Carver's age is 45\n\neq1 = Eq(C, 2*D - 5)\neq2 = Eq(D, 3*S + 4)\n\n# substitute C=45 in eq1\neq1 = eq1.subs(C, 45)\n\n# solve eq1 for D\nD_value = solve(eq1, D)[0]\n\n# substitute D_value in eq2\neq2 = eq2.subs(D, D_value)\n\n# solve eq2 for S\nS_value = solve(eq2, S)[0]\n\nprint(\"Son's age:\", S_value)\n```\n\nNow we need to execute the above Python code to get the value of `S_value`, which is the son's age."

Using the equation C = 2D - 5, we calculate D (Daughter's age) as 25 years old because 25 * 2 - 5 = 45.\n3. Checking D with the equation D = 3S + 4, we substitute and solve for S (Son's age) to get 7 years old because 25 = 3*7 + 4.\n\nThe calculated values for Daughter's and Son's ages make the original equations true, thus the answer is correct.\n\nSo, Carver's son is \boxed{7} years old."
