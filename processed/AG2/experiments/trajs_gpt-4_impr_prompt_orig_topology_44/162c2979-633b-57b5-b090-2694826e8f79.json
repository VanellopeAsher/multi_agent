  "problem": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum.

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If each pack of strawberry gum cost $2, how much did Suzie pay in all?"

Therefore, I will write Python code to calculate the total amount that Suzie paid for the gum.\n\nShe bought four packs of gum, but we don't know the number of packs for each flavor. \n\n- Two packs of strawberry gum each cost $2.\n- One pack of grape gum costs $2.\n- She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum as she did for a pack of grape gum, which is $2/2 = $1. \n\nWe will add all these costs together to find the total. \n\nHere is the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\n# Number of Strawberry gums 2, Each cost $2\nstrawberry_gums_price = 2 * 2 \n\n# Grape gums 1, Each cost $2\ngrape_gums_price = 2\n\n# Green Apple gums 1, half as cost of Grape gums -> 2/2 = $1\ngreen_apple_gums_price = 2 / 2 \n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = strawberry_gums_price + grape_gums_price + green_apple_gums_price\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the total cost and print it."
