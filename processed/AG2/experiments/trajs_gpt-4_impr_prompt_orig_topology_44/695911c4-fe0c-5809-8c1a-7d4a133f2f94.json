Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $10. After 10 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

      "content": "Step-by-Step Process:\n\nThe problem can be divided into two parts:\n\nPart 1: For 10 years, the cost per visit remained the same at $10, and Pauline visited three times a year. The total cost for this period can be computed directly using simple multiplication (i.e., 10 * 3 * 10).\n\nPart 2: After 10 years, the cost per visit increased by 150%, making it $25 (i.e., 10 + 10 * 1.5). Pauline made three annual visits for three more years (i.e., 25 * 3 * 3).\n\nAdding the costs computed in parts 1 and 2 will give us the total amount Pauline spent over 13 years. \n\nNow  let's compute these costs.\n\nPython Calculations Required:\n\n1. Cost when price per visit is $10 = 10 (*annual visits) * 10 (*no. of years)\n2. New price per visit after 10 years = $10 * (1 + 1.5)\n3. Cost when price per visit is the new price = New price per visit * yearly visits * no. of years\n4. Total cost = Cost from step 1 + Cost from step 3\n\nNow let's calculate using Python."

      "content": "Great, we have the total cost. Verifying this step by step:\n\n1. For the first 10 years, the cost per visit is $10. As she visits 3 times a year, the annual expense is $10 * 3 = $30. Over ten years, the total expense is $30 * 10 = $300. With the given inputs, we correctly calculated this as $300.\n2. The price per visit then increased to $10 + ($10 * 1.5) = $25 after 10 years. The cost of visiting three times a year for the next 3 years would be $25 * 3 * 3 = $225. We obtained the same.\n3. Adding the two amounts, $300 + $225 = $525, gives us the total spending over 13 years. We correctly got this amount.\n\nGiven all these calculations are correct, I am confident to say that Pauline spent a total of \\$525 on all visits to the museum in 13 years.\n\nSo, the result is  \\boxed{525}."
