Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and another score that is forgotten. If the mean score is 70, what's the forgortten score?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved using the formula for an arithmetic mean. \n\nThe arithmetic mean (or simply \"mean\") of a list of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. For this specific case, the formula would be:\n\n```python\nmean = (sum of all scores) / number of scores\n```\n\nHere, we know that the mean score is 70 and there are 10 grades in total (9 known, 1 unknown). The sum of all the scores can be calculated as follows:\n\n```python\ntotal sum = mean * number of scores\n```\n\nThen, we can obtain the forgotten score by subtracting the sum of the known scores from the total sum.\n\nLet's apply these steps in Python:"

We know that the mean is calculated by dividing the total sum of the scores by the number of scores, thus:\n\n```\n(mean * number of scores) = total sum\n```\n\nTherefore, the total sum of Sally's scores is:\n\n```python\nprint(mean * num_scores)\n```\n\nNext, to verify, let's calculate the sum of all scores including the one we just found:\n```python\nprint(known_sum + forgotten_score)\n```\n\nIf both values are equal, this confirms we have found the correct forgotten score.\nLet's now execute these verification steps in Python."
