Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

Identify the base angle from the ground to the pyramids.\n2. Compute the incremental angle after 10 hours at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.\n3. Compute the new angle from the ground to the sun after the sun moved at a rate of 3 degrees per hour for 2 hours.\n\nPython can be utilized to perform these calculations.\n\nLet's proceed by coding the solution:\n```python\n# Starting angle from the ground to the pyramids\nstart_angle = 32  # degrees\n\n# The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees/hour for 10 hours\nfirst_movement = 5 * 10  # degrees\n\n# The sun moves at a rate of 3 degrees/hour for 2 hours\nsecond_movement = 3 * 2  # degrees\n\n# Compute the total angle after the sun's movements\ntotal_angle = start_angle + first_movement + second_movement\ntotal_angle\n```\nPlease run the above code to find the total number of degrees from the ground to the sun after the movements."

The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees/hour for 10 hours:\\\n   Incremental angle = 5°/hour * 10 hours = 50°\n3. The sun then moves at a rate of 3 degrees/hour for 2 hours:\\\n   Incremental angle = 3°/hour * 2 hours = 6°\n4. Computing the total angle:\\\n   Total angle = start angle + first incremental angle + second incremental angle\\\n   Total angle = 32° + 50° + 6° = 88°\n\nEnsure the solution fulfils the requirements of the problem.
