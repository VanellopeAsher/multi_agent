Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJoey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble. He scores some points. Then Marcy, who has 225 points, scores 10 points. By how many points is Joey now winning?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved by calculation using Python code directly.\n\nKey idea: To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we first need to find out Joey's total points and Marcy's total points. After that, we can subtract Marcy's total points from Joey's total points to get the difference.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nP_Joey_initial = Initial points Joey has before his turn = 214\nP_Joey_new = New points Joey scores in his turn (unknown initially)\nP_Marcy = New points that Marcy scores = 10\nP_Marcy_initial = Initial points that Marcy has = 225\n\nTotal points for Joey = P_Joey_initial + P_Joey_new\nTotal points for Marcy = P_Marcy_initial + P_Marcy\nDifference = Total points for Joey - Total points for Marcy\n\nPython code can use these calculated results to find out the final result. In the code, \"P_Joey_new\" has to be given a value (or needs to be calculated if it is related to some other details in the problem). Since it is not mentioned in the problem, I will return None for this situation. \n\nLet's use Python to deal with this:\n\n```python\nP_Joey_initial = 214\nP_Joey_new = None  # This is unknown from the problem\nP_Marcy_initial = 225\nP_Marcy = 10\n\nif P_Joey_new is not None:\n    total_points_Joey = P_Joey_initial + P_Joey_new\n    total_points_Marcy = P_Marcy_initial + P_Marcy\n    difference = total_points_Joey - total_points_Marcy\n    print(difference)\nelse:\n    print(None)\n```\n\nThe output should be None since \"P_Joey_new\" is unknown. \n\nAfter running the above Python code, if the value of `P_Joey_new` is given or calculated, we can get the final result. If `P_Joey_new` is still None, then the final result would also be None.\n\nRemember, omit excessive description in the code. Your final answer needs to be in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, and only numbers should be inside."
