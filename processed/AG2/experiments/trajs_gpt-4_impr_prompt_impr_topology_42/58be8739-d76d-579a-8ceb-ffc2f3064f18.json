      "content": "To determine the total time John spent sightseeing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time John spent swimming: This is half the time he spent boating, so we multiply 6 hours by 0.5 to get 3 hours.\n   \n2. Calculate the total time John spent watching shows: Since each show took 2 hours and John watched 3 shows, we multiply 3 shows by 2 hours to get 6 hours.\n   \n3. Calculate the total time John spent on all activities: We already know that the time John spent boating, swimming, and watching shows adds up to 100% - 30% = 70% of his total time. So, we sum up the time of these three activities (boating, swimming, and shows) which is 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (shows) = 15 hours. This represents 70% of John's total time out.\n   \n4. Calculate John's total time out: If 15 hours represents 70% of John's total time, then to find the total time out we divide 15 hours by 0.7.\n   \n5. Calculate the time John spent sightseeing: After figuring out John's total time out, subtract the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows from the total time out to get the time John spent sightseeing."
