      "content": "To resolve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, establish the amount of time John spent swimming. According to the problem, it's half the time he spent boating, which is 30 hours.\n2. Then, calculate the total time John spent watching shows. As each show was 20 hours long, and he watched 30 of them, that means he spent 600 hours on this activity.\n3. It's stated that the time he spent watching shows represents 30% of the total time of his vacation. So, to establish the total time of his vacation, take the time he spent watching shows (600 hours) and calculate what that time is 30% of. We can formulize this as `Total time = 600 / 0.3`, which gives 2000 hours.\n4. With the total time of his vacation established, it's possible to calculate the amount of time spent sightseeing. This activity represented 40% of his total time. So, to find this out, calculate `40% of 2000`, which equals `0.4 * 2000`, that is 800 hours."

Then calculate the total time for watching shows and measure it as a percentage of the total vacation time. Finally, calculate the time spent sightseeing as a percentage of the total time. \n\n```python\n# Step 1. Define the time spent boating and swimming\nboating_hours = 60\nswimming_hours = boating_hours / 2 \n\n# Step 2. Calculate the total time spent on watching shows\nshows_hours_each = 20 \nnumber_of_shows = 30 \ntotal_show_watching_hours = shows_hours_each * number_of_shows\n\n# Step 3. The time spent watching shows represented 30% of the total time\ntotal_vacation_hours = total_show_watching_hours / 0.3 \n\n# Step 4. Establish the time spent sightseeing as 40% of the total time\nsightseeing_hours = total_vacation_hours * 0.4\n```\nLet's print out the final result, i.e., the time John spent sightseeing.\n\n```python\nprint(sightseeing_hours)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor. Let's execute this code and see if it confirms the solution."

Let's transition back to the agents' discussion to get the final solution.\n\nBased on the plan provided by Agent_Problem_Solver and the code that Agent_Code_Executor wanted to execute, the calculation of the total vacation time and the time spent sightseeing seems correct. The total vacation time was correctly identified as 2000 hours (600 hours is 30% of this total), and the time John spent sightseeing was 40% of this, which yields the value of 800 hours.\n\nTherefore, I confirm Agent_Problem_Solver's calculation. John spent 800 hours sightseeing. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{800}**."
