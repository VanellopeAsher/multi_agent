This means multiply the hours by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n2. Calculate the number of calls he can handle daily by dividing the total minutes he works by the minutes it takes him to handle a call.\n3. Multiply the number of calls he handles per day by four, because he works like this four days of the week.\n4. For Friday, add the additional 2 hours he works to the typical 6 hours, and then convert this total time to minutes.\n5. Calculate the number of calls he can handle on Friday, again by dividing the total minutes he works by the time per call.\n6. Finally, add the number of calls from Friday to the total from the other four days to get the number of calls he handles in the entire week."
