      "content": "To solve this problem:\n\n1. We should first figure out how many canvas bags Tara sold. The profit from a single bag can be calculated by subtracting the purchase price from the selling price, which is $8 - $4 = $4 per bag.\n2. Then, we can calculate the total amount of bags Tara sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag, which gives $160 / $4 = 40 bags.\n3. Finally, we can get the number of packs of bags Tara bought by dividing the total amount of bags by 5 (since each pack contains 5 bags). So, the number of packs is 40 / 5 = 8 packs. \n\nSo, Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags."
