In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Deduct the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is 16.\n3. 1/4th of those who fell sick had previous commitments, so subtract that number as well.\n4. The result will be the total number of people who showed up at Martha's party.\n\nLet's perform the calculations."
