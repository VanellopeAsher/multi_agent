      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to find out how many people Billy helps per hour. This requires several steps:\n\n1. First calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th, this number is 31 (days in March) + 19 (Days in April) = 50 days\n2. Calculate the number of days Billy takes off, this is 20% of the total days, or 50 * 0.2 = 10 days.\n3. Calculate the number of days Billy works, this is total days - days off, or 50 - 10 = 40 days.\n4. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works, this is the number of days he works times the number of hours per day, or 40 * 3 = 120 hours.\n5. Finally, divide the total number of people Billy helps by the total number of hours he works to find the number of people he helps per hour. This is 240 / 120 = 2 people per hour. \n\nSo, according to my calculations, Billy helps 2 people per hour."

      "content": "I used simple mathematics to solve this problem. The question gave us two known quantities - the total number of people Billy helps (240) and the percentage of days he takes off (20%). I began by calculating the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. Then, I calculated the number of days Billy works by subtracting the days off from the total number of days. From this, I found the total number of hours Billy works by multiplying the working days by the 3 hours he works each day. Finally, I divided the total number of people Billy helps over the total hours worked to find the number of people he helps per hour.\n\nThis solution assumes that Billy helps an integral number of people per hour and that he works exactly 3 hours each day he works. Any variation in these factors would cause a change in the final answer."
