Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here is a step-by-step solution to resolve the task:\n\nStep 1: Compute the number of dance classes Judy teaches each week.\n- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. So, that's 5 classes * 5 days = 25 classes.\n- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. \n- On Sunday, she doesn't teach any classes, so that's 0 classes.\n- Therefore, the total number of classes she teaches in a week is 25 (from Monday to Friday) + 8 (on Saturday) = 33 classes.\n\nStep 2: Identify the amount of earnings she makes per class. \n- Since each class has 15 students and she charges $15 per student, she makes 15 students * $15/student = $225 per class.\n\nStep 3: Compute Judy's weekly earnings.\n- If she makes $225 per class and she teaches 33 classes in a week, she makes $225/class * 33 classes = $7425 in a week. \n\nPlease note that the free 5-minute warm-up session doesn't affect her earnings. So, it doesn't factor into this computation. At the end of this calculation, we find that Judy makes $7425 in a week."
