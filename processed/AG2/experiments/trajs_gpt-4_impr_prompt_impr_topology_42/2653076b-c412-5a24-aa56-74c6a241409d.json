First, I will calculate the total cost of each item by multiplying the price per item by the quantity ordered.\n2. Then, I will calculate the total cost of all items by summing the total cost of each item.\n3. Finally, I will apply the loyalty card discount to the total cost. The discount can be calculated by taking 10% of the total cost before discount. This amount can then be subtracted from the total cost before discount to get the final total cost. \n\nNow, let's transform this strategy into Python code to get the final result."
