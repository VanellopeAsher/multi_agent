After that, we multiply the total by 3 (since the lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else).\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Add up the money Walter collects from his neighbors ($300), the online fund ($1200), and his friend ($120).\n2. Multiply the total contribution by 3 because the lawyer will donate three times the total amount."

We also know that the amount collected from an online fund is $1200. \n3. Additionally, Walter's friend contributes $120. \n4. We add up all this money to get the total amount collected.\n5. The lawyer donates three times the total amount collected. \n\nLet's calculate the lawyers contribution.\n\n```python\n# amount collected from neighbors\nneighbor_donation = 300\n\n# amount collected from online fund\nonline_donation = 1200\n\n# amount collected from friend\nfriend_donation = 120\n\n# measure total amount collected before lawyer's contribution.\ntotal_before_lawyer = neighbor_donation + online_donation + friend_donation\n\n# lawyer's donation \nlawyer_donation = total_before_lawyer * 3\n\nprint(lawyer_donation)\n``` \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
