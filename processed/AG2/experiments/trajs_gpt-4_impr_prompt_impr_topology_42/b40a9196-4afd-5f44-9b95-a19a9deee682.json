In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate the total cost of food items which is 2 dollars (milk) + 3 dollars (eggs) = 5 dollars.\n2. Calculate the total cost of non-food items which is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.\n3. Calculate the tax on the non-food items which is 10 dollars * 10% = 1 dollar.\n4. Finally, calculate the total cost of all items which is cost of food items + cost of non-food items + tax on non-food items = 5 dollars + 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 16 dollars. \n\nSo, the total cost of all the items is 16 dollars."

They calculated the total cost of the items by first identifying which items were food (and thus exempt from tax), and which items were not food (and thus subjected to a 10% tax). The total cost was then calculated as follows: cost of food items + cost of non-food items + tax on non-food items = $5 (for food) + $10 (for non-food) + $1 (for tax) = $16. The solution was further validated by Python code provided by Agent Code Executor, which yielded the same result, $16. \n\nThis verifies that the computation was correct and the total cost of all John's items is indeed $16."
