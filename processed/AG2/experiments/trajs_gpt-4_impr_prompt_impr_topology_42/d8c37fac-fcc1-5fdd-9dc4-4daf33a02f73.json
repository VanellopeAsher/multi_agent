Calculate the total cost per basket:\n   - The cost for petunias per basket is 30 petunias * $3.00/petunia \n   - The cost for sweet potato vines per basket is 20 vines * $2.50/vine\n   - Add these two amounts to find the total cost per basket\n2. Multiply the total cost per basket by the total number of baskets (50) to find the total cost for all the baskets. \n\nThis will give us the total cost Katherine will spend filling all 50 hanging baskets."
