      "content": "Ok, let's solve it step by step:\n\n1. Find out the number of pairs of t-shirts Jake decided to buy. Since the offer is buy one get one 50% off, we should consider a pair as 2 t-shirts. Hence, Jake bought 20/2 = 10 pairs of t-shirts.\n\n2. Determine the price per pair:\n   - The first t-shirt in a pair is full price - $80\n   - The second t-shirt in a pair is 50% off - $80 / 2 = $40\n   - So, the total price of a pair is $80 + $40 = $120\n\n3. Calculate the cost for all t-shirts:\n   - The total cost of t-shirts is the price per pair * number of pairs, which is $120 * 10 = $1200\n\n4. Determine the sale price of the shoes:\n   - The shoes are 40% off, which is $400 * 40 / 100 = $160\n   - Hence, the sale price of the shoes is $400 - $160 = $240\n\n5. Find the total amount Jake spent at the store:\n   - The total cost is the cost of the t-shirts + the price of the shoes, which is $1200 + $240 = $1440. \n\nSo, Jake spends a total of $1440 at the store."
