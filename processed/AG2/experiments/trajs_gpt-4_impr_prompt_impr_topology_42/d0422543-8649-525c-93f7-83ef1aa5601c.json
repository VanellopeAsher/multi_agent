From the problem, we know that Carver is 8 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this as:\n   C = 2S - 8\n\n3. By substituting the value of C (60 years) into this equation we can solve for S:\n   60 = 2S - 8\n\n4. Solving this equation will give us the son's age."

Identifying a relationship between Carver's and his son's age (S), where Carver's age is 8 years less than twice his son's age, written as C = 2S - 8\n3. Substituting Carver's age into the equation to solve for the son's age which gives us S = (C + 8) / 2\n4. Solving this equation provided the son's age as 34 years.\n\nSo, we can conclude that Carver's son is 34 years old."
