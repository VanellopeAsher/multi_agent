      "content": "To solve this problem, you first need to understand that two-thirds of the total number of students have desktop computers. This means one-third do not have desktop computers. Since we know the number of students without desktop computers is 30, we can set up the following equation to solve for the total number of students:\n\n1/3 * Total_students = 30\n\nBy multiplying each side by 3, we can find the total number of students:\n\nTotal_students = 30 * 3\n\nHence, the calculation to perform is 30*3.

Hence, 30 represents one-third of all students. Hence, multiplying 30 by 3 gives us the total number of students, which is 90. Both agents provided correct solutions."
