Therefore, if we multiply 2000 (the number of helmets) by 2, we will get 4000 footballs.\n\nAdding all these values together (2000 helmets + 1000 robots + 4000 footballs) will give us the total number of items Dominick saw.

And there are 2000 helmets.\n\nLet's follow these steps to find the total number of items:\n\n     1. Computing the number of robots: Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. Since there are 2000 helmets this means he saw 2000/2 = 1000 robots.\n     2. Computing the number of footballs: Dominick saw twice as many footballs as helmets. So, he saw 2000*2 = 4000 footballs.\n     3. Adding all items: We add the number of robots, helmets and footballs which gives us the total number of items.\n\n```python\n\n# number of helmets\nhelmets = 2000\n# Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets \nrobots = helmets/2\n# Dominick saw twice as many footballs as helmets\nfootballs = helmets*2\n# total items that Dominick saw will be the sum of robots, helmets and footballs\ntotal_items = helmets + robots + footballs    \nprint(total_items)\n```\n\nLet's run the above python code snippet to get the total number of items."

The calculation involved half and double the number of helmets to find the number of robots and footballs, respectively. After calculating these, the agent added all the numbers to find the total.\n\nOn the other hand, Agent Code Executor proposed a Python code snippet doing the same calculations as mentioned by Agent Problem Solver. When the code was run, it returned a total of 7000 items, which matches the manual calculation.\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that both solutions are correct.

The total number of items that Dominick saw is indeed 7000.\n\nThe solution provided by the Agent Problem Solver was correct right from the beginning. The problem stated clear relationships between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. After executing the basic operations, the result is the addition of all items. This equates to 7000.\n\nThe solution provided by Agent Code Executor translated those steps into Python code. The code computed the number of robots and the number of footballs based on the number of helmets. Then it added the three results together to give us the total number of items. When this Python code was executed, it also resulted in 7000, thus confirming the results of Agent Problem Solver.\n\nTherefore, I can officially confirm the total number of items that Dominick saw was 7000."

This count includes 2000 helmets, 1000 robots, and 4000 footballs.\n\nThe Python code execution makes the calculation process more interactive and serves as a practical example for learners. The code has successfully implemented the description from the problem and also derived the same number of total items, 7000.\n\nHence, the collective solution for this problem is 7000, concluded by both logical calculation and Python code execution.\n"

Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. Given there are 2000 helmets, this equates to 2000/2 = 1000 robots.\n2. He also saw half as many helmets as footballs. Given that there are 2000 helmets, this equates to 2 * 2000 = 4000 footballs.\n\nAdding together the number of robots, helmets, and footballs, we get a total of 7000 items.
