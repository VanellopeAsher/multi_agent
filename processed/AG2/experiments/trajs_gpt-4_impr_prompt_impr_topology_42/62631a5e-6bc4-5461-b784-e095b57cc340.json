Since they both got 700 corn chips, we multiply the number of corn chips one person got by the number of people. Hence 700*2 = 1400.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of corn chips that Collins got. Since it's stated that Collins received 150 more corn chips than the number the others got, we add the number of corn chips one person got to the excess. Hence 700 + 150 = 850.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of corn chips. Since we know the number of corn chips each individual got, we add these together. Hence 1400 + 850 = 2250. \n\nIn conclusion, there were 2250 corn chips altogether."
