He ran 3.5 miles each of these days, so the total is 3.5 miles * 3 days = 10.5 miles.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total distance Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday. He ran 5.5 miles each of these days, so the total is 5.5 miles * 2 days = 11 miles.\n\nStep 3: Sum up the totals from Step 1 and Step 2 to get the total distance Sam ran over the week. The total is 10.5 miles + 11 miles = 21.5 miles.\n\nSo, Sam ran a total of 21.5 miles this week."
