      "content": "Here is a step-by-step guide to calculating how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum:\n\n1. Determine the total amount Pauline spent during the first 10 years. Since she visits the museum three times a year at $10 per visit, this comes to 10 years * 3 visits/year * $10/visit = $300.\n \n2. Next, find out the new cost of one visit after the price increased by 150%. This is $10 + $10 * 150/100 = $25.\n \n3. Calculate the total amount Pauline spent during the following 3 years. With the increased cost, this comes to 3 years * 3 visits/year * $25/visit = $225.\n \n4. Add the amount Pauline spent during the first 10 years to the amount she spent during the last 3 years to find the total. That's $300 from the first 10 years + $225 from the last 3 years = $525. \n\nSo Pauline spent a total of $525 on all her visits to the museum over the 13 years."

Calculate the total amount Pauline spent during the following 3 years.\n4.

After the price increased by 150%, the new cost of one visit became $25.\n3. The total cost for the next 3 years with this increased cost was $225.\n4. Adding these amounts, we get $300 + $225 = $525, which is the total amount Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum over the 13 years.\n\nAlso, Agent Code Executor run the Python code, which printed 525. It means Pauline spent a total of 525 dollars on all her visits to the museum. \n\nBoth agents' solutions are absolutely correct and they match. Therefore, we can conclude that Pauline spent $525 on all museum visits over the course of 13 years."
