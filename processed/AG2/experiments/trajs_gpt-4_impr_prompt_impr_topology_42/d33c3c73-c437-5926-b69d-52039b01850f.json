On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet. \n2. On Tuesday, the depth was 7 feet more than on Monday. Therefore, we add 7 feet to Monday's depth.\n3. On Wednesday, the depth of water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate two thirds of Tuesday's depth.\n4. On Thursday, the tank's water depth increased by half the difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday. Hence, we calculate the difference between Tuesday's and Wednesday's depths, divide the difference by two and add it to Wednesday's depth.\n\nLet's find out the depth using these steps."
