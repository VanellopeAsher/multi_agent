Using Agent_Problem_Solver's steps, this translates into Python code as follows:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate how many rows are needed for the red tulips\nred_tulips = 36\nred_tulips_per_row = 6\nred_rows = red_tulips / red_tulips_per_row\n\n# Step 2: Calculate how many rows are needed for the blue tulips\nblue_tulips = 24\nblue_tulips_per_row = 8\nblue_rows = blue_tulips / blue_tulips_per_row\n\n# Step 3: Sum up the totals to get the final result\ntotal_rows = red_rows + blue_rows\n\nprint(total_rows)  # Printing the result\n```\n\nSince the problem does not specify if the rows of red and blue tulips have to be consecutive or intermixed, we can assume they can be arranged in any order, as long as the color arrangement per row is kept. Let's execute the code. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
