      "content": "Here's how I would approach this problem:\n\n1. First, from the problem we know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of the small ones. Since a small stuffed animal sells for $40, this means each large stuffed animal sells for $120 ($40 * 3 = $120).\n\n2. We also know that she earned $1200 from sales that day. So, we need to find out how many small and large stuffed animals were sold in total to add up to this amount.\n\n3. We know she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. We denote the number of large stuffed animals she sold as x. The number of small animals is then 2x.\n\n4. So, the total sales for the large animals is the number sold times the price or x * $120. And the total sales for the small animals is the number sold times the price or 2x * $40.\n\n5. We know that the total amount earned is $1200. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these facts: \n\n    x * $120 + 2x * $40 = $1200\n    \n6. Solving this equation will give us the number of large stuffed animals sold (x). To find out how many small stuffed animals were sold, we just multiply that number by 2. \n\nLet's proceed to solve the equation to get the value of x. Then we double it to get the number of small animals sold."

From the explanation above, we know that the equation to solve is: $120x + $80x = $1200. \n\nWe will use the sympy package to analyze and solve this equation.\n\nLet's go ahead and write the Python code."

      "content": "Agent Code Executor has obtained a solution suggesting that 12 small stuffed animals were sold.\n\nLet's review the agents' solutions:\n\n- Agent Problem Solver proposed a scenario where we calculate the number of small stuffed animals sold by solving the equation: $120x + $80x = $1200. The solution to this equation, x, represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and doubling this value gives us the number of small animals sold.\n\n- Agent Code Executor validated the model using Python and the sympy package. The code executed without error and returned a logical result: 12 small stuffed animals were sold.\n\nUpon careful evaluation of the problem and solutions provided, I can confirm that the agents' methods are sound, and the calculations are correct. Therefore, the final solution to this problem is the value returned by the Python script: 12.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND** **\\boxed{12}**"
