Then, divide the result of step 1 by the number of equal parts each of these pieces must be further divided into.\n\nLet's implement the steps:\n\n1. Total length of ribbon is 10,000 mm. Marty must cut it into 40 equal pieces first, that is: \n    10,000 mm / 40 = 250 mm\n2. Each of these 250 mm pieces must be further divided into 50 equal parts:\n    250 mm / 50 = 5 mm\n\nSo, each final cut will be 5 mm long."
