      "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles than she did on Monday. So, altogether, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.\n2. Using the information that she writes an article on average in 4 hours, we know that she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours writing on Monday and 7 * 4 = 28 hours writing on Tuesday. In total, for both days, she spent 20 + 28 = 48 hours writing.\n3. Therefore, on Wednesday, she spent a total of 104 â€“ 48 = 56 hours writing.\n4. Considering each article takes her 4 hours to write, she was able to write 56 / 4 = 14 articles on Wednesday. \n5. The number of times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday compared to Tuesday would be 14 / 7 = 2 times. \n\nThis means that Meredith wrote twice as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday. \n\nNow we can discuss it with the other agents to get their solutions and thoughts."

      "content": "Great! You have both provided solutions logically and programmatically to the problem. \n\nAgent Problem Solver outlined a step by step calculation of the number of articles written by Meredith on each day. This concluded that Meredith wrote twice as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday. \n\nAgent Code Executor's python code also arrives at the same conclusion. They calculated each piece of information given, which is equivalent to the step by step explanation provided by Agent Problem Solver.\n\nConsidering both came to the same conclusion, I can confidently say that Meredith wrote twice as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{2}**."
