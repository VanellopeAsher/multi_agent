Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

This is her previous score (225 points) plus her new points (10 points), which equals 235 points.\n  \nStep 2: Deduct Marcy's total point (235 points) from Joey's score (214 point) before his turn. The result is the number of points Joey needs to score in his turn to beat Marcy.\n\nStep 3: If Joey scores more than this number, then he is winning by the difference between his score and Marcy's total points.\n\nThis will give us a complete answer."

The final number of points Joey has after his turn - a critical value needed for the calculation - isn't provided in the problem statement. \n\nWithout this piece of information, it's impossible to determine by how many points Joey is winning. As a result, I cannot provide a numerical solution value.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{'None'}.\n\nThe best we can say, given the available information, is that Joey will be winning if the points he scores during his turn exceed the value proposed by Agent Code Executor. If Joey is able to score more than 21 points (which is the difference between Marcy's total points and Joey's score before his turn), he would be leading the game. However, we cannot determine by how many points he's leading without knowing his score after his turn. \n\nOften, in problems such as these, there could be a follow-up question providing additional information (like Joey's score after his turn), which could lead to an exact numerical answer. However, given the current statement, the problem is incomplete."
