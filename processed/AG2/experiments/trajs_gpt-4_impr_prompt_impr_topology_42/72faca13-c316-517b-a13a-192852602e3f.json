      "content": "To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:\n\n1. Convert the money Kelly has from quarters and dimes to cents.\n2. Subtract the cost of the items Kelly buys from the total money she has.\n\nHere's the detailed step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Convert Quarters and Dimes to Cents:\n    * Kelly has 5 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equal to 25 cents, 5 quarters will be equal to 5 * 25 = 125 cents.\n    * She also has 2 dimes. 1 dime is equal to 10 cents, therefore, 2 dimes will be equal to 2 * 10 = 20 cents.\n    * Adding these together, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.\n\n2. Calculate the Cost of the Items Kelly Buys:\n    * The can of pop costs 55 cents and the candy bar costs 45 cents. Therefore, the total cost of these items is 55 + 45 = 100 cents.\n\n3. Subtract the Cost of the Items from the Total Amount Kelly Has:\n    * After buying these items, Kelly will be left with 145 - 100 = 45 cents. \n\nSo, Kelly will have 45 cents left."

      "content": "To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she has in cents, then subtract the cost of the pop and the candy bar. \n\nHere is how to do it:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount in cents:\n   - Kelly has 5 quarters. As each quarter is 25 cents, this amounts to 5 * 25 cents.\n   - She also has 2 dimes. As each dime is 10 cents, this amounts to 2 * 10 cents.\n   - The total amount she has is the sum of the amounts from the quarters and dimes.\n\n2. Subtract the cost of the purchases:\n   - The can of pop costs 55 cents and the candy bar costs 45 cents. Subtract these costs from the total amount she has to find out how many cents she has left.\n\nAfter these steps, we should have the answer. I'll write some Python code to do these calculations."
