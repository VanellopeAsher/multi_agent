      "content": "Here's how you can solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms. Since 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of proteins, 300 grams (which is twice as much as 150 grams) will contain twice as much protein as 150 grams of mushrooms. \n\nStep 2: Multiply the amount of protein John gets per day by 7 to determine how much protein he gets per week.\n\nThe detailed calculation is as follows:\n\nStep 1: 4 grams of proteins in 150 grams of mushrooms mean there would be 4*2 = 8 grams of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms.\nStep 2: If he eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day, in 7 days (1 week), he will have consumed 8*7 = 56 grams of protein.\n\nSo, John gets 56 grams of protein from mushrooms per week.\nNow, let's discuss this with other agents."

Now I'll execute the Python code to confirm the solution. \n\n```python\n# Define the initial amount of protein in 150g of mushrooms\nprotein_in_150g = 4\n\n# Calculate the amount of protein in 300g of mushrooms\n# Since 300g is twice as much as 150g, it will contain twice as much protein\nprotein_in_300g = protein_in_150g * 2\n\n# Calculate the amount of protein John gets in a week\n# As there are 7 days in a week, and he eats 300g of mushrooms every day\nprotein_per_week = protein_in_300g * 7\n\nprint(protein_per_week)\n```\n\nWe're expecting the result to be 56 grams. Let's run the code and see the outcome.\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."

They first calculated the amount of protein in 300 grams of mushrooms, since we know 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein. They then determined the amount of protein consumed on a weekly basis by multiplying the daily intake by 7 (days in a week).\nThe Python code executed by Agent Code Executor also returned 56, which matches the numerical solution proposed by Agent Problem Solver. Therefore, I confirm that the amount of protein John gets from mushrooms over a week is 56 grams. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{56}** grams of protein per week"
