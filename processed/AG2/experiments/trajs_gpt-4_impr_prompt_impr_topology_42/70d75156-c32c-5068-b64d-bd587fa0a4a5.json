In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate how many oranges were in these boxes.\n3. Deduct the number of oranges given to her mom and sister.\n4. Calculate the amount of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself.\n5. Calculate the remaining amount that was sold.\n\nSince the problem doesn't mention how many boxes she initially bought, we can't continue from here. We can therefore assume that there's been some miscommunication, and we would need this piece of information to solve the problem."
