Calculate the monthly cost for food: There are 4 weeks in a month, and since food costs $25 per week, the monthly cost for food is 4 weeks/month * $25/week = $100/month.\n\n2. The monthly cost for treats is given as $20/month.\n\n3. The monthly cost for medicine is given as $100/month.\n\n4. The monthly cost for the special shampoo is given as $15/month.\n\n5. Calculate the monthly cost for the toy: Since a toy is bought every two months and costs $10, the monthly cost for the toy is $10/toy / 2 months = $5/month.\n\n6. Calculate the total monthly cost: Add the monthly costs of food, treats, medicine, special shampoo, and the toy together. \n\n7. Calculate the total annual cost: Multiply the total monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12 months/year).\n\nThis will give us the total money Madeline spends on her dog per year."
