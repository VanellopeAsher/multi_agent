In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Since Gerald works for an entire week (7 days) and he earns $300 per day, you multiply $300 by 7 to find out how much he makes in a week. \n\nStep 2: Now that we have Gerald's weekly earnings, subtract his total spending for the week. In this case, Gerald spent $1000 in total. \n\nStep 3: The result from step 2 will be the amount of money Gerald has left."
