Add the price of the fish tank and the packet of fish food.\n    2. Multiply the price of each stone packet by the number of packets Scarlett bought and add this to the total. \n    3. Repeat this process for the coral pieces and fish, adding each to the total. \n    4. The sum of these amounts will be the total expense. \n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\n    Cost of fish tank = $10.00\n    Cost of each stone packet = $2.50; since Scarlett bought two, the total cost of the stone packets will be 2 * $2.50.\n    Cost of each coral piece = $2.00; since she bought three, the total cost of the coral pieces will be 3 * $2.00.\n    Cost of each fish = $0.50; since she bought 20, the total cost of the fish will be 20 * $0.50.\n    Cost of fish food packet = $2.00\n\nBy adding all these values, we will get the total amount spent by Scarlett."
