Each pound of weight loss requires burning 3500 calories, so we'll multiply his weight loss goal by 3500 to find the total calorie deficit he needs.\n\n2. To determine how many days he has until his birthday, we'll subtract the current date (December 31st) from his birthday (July 19th).\n\n3. We'll then divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to get the daily calorie deficit Andy needs. \n\nLet's compute all these."

If Andy is committed and consistent, this is a feasible goal. Other factors such as his diet and exercise regimen, as well as potential changes to his metabolic rate, will also influence his weight loss.
