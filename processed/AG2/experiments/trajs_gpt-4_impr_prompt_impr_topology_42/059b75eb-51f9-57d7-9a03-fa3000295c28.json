After the day of intense rain, this volume doubles, i.e., it becomes 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n3. On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water is added, therefore, the total volume of water becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.\n\nThe total volume of water flowing through that point of the river on the third day is 14000 gallons."

I'm ready to execute this code."
