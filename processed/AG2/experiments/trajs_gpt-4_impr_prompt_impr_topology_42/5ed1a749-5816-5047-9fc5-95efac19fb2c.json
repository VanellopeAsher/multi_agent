The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it contains 3x pieces. The third set has 1/4 of the number of pieces in the first set so it contains x/4 pieces.\n\nThe total number of pieces Johnny has to pick would then be x + 3x + (x/4) = 4.25x.\n\nCould you please provide the number of pieces in the first box set?"

As it stands, we only have the formula where x is the number of pieces in the first set. In the absence of knowing the number of lego pieces in the first set, I'll proceed to implement a function in python given the formula provided by Agent_Problem_Solver which takes x as input. \n\n```python\ndef total_lego_pieces(first_set_pieces):\n    # calculate the total pieces based on the multiplier for each set\n    total_pieces = first_set_pieces + 3*first_set_pieces + first_set_pieces/4\n    return total_pieces\n```\n\nYou can later call this function with the number of pieces in the first set as argument to get the total number of lego pieces.\n \ne.g. total_lego_pieces(number_of_pieces_in_first_set)"

Their solutions are indeed founded on the correct analysis of the mathematical relationships between the numbers of pieces in the three sets. That adds up to:\n\nFirst set: x pieces.\nSecond set: 3x pieces.\nThird set: 1/4x pieces.\n\nThe total, therefore, as accurately calculated by both agents is 4.25x.\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't specify the number of pieces in the first set, the agents have rightfully given their answers in terms of that unknown number. \n\nOnce the number of pieces in the first set is known, substitute that number for x in the equation 4.25x to get the total number of Lego pieces. Or in case of Agent Code Executor's solution, simply call the function total_lego_pieces with argument representing number of pieces in first set. It will return the total number of Lego pieces."
