In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

We know the total distance he runs per week (60 miles) and how often he runs per week (3 days), but there is no information about the time it takes for him to cover these distances. \n\nGiven the information provided, we can only calculate the average distance he runs per day, not his speed. \n\nMaybe the question could be framed as \"What's the average distance that John runs in a day?\" or the missing time data could be provided. Should we ask for more information, or should I proceed with the information we currently have?"
