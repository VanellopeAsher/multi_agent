In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here's how you can find the average heel height:\n\n1. First, find the total height of the heels that the women are wearing. \n2. Then, divide this total by the number of women at the party.\n\nSteps to follow:\n1. Multiply the height of the first type of heel (4.5 inches) by the number of women wearing this type of heel (3 women). This gives 4.5 * 3 = 13.5 inches.\n2. Multiply the height of the second type of heel (2.5 inches) by the number of women wearing this type of heel (3 women). This gives 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 inches.\n3. Add the total height of the first type of heels to the total height of the second type of heels. This gives 13.5 + 7.5 = 21 inches.\n4. Divide this total height (21 inches) by the total number of women (6 women). This gives 21 / 6 = 3.5 inches. \n\nThe average height of heels at the party is 3.5 inches."
