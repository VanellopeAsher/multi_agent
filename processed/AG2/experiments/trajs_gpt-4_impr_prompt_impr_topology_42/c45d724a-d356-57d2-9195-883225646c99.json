In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate the total cost of the notebooks, which is the number of notebooks times the cost of each notebook,\n2. Calculate the total cost of the ballpens, which is the number of ballpens times the cost of each ballpen,\n3. Add the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpens together.

      "content": "The Python code performed the following calculations:\n\n1. First, it calculated the total cost for the notebooks:\n    `total_notebook_cost = notebook_cost * number_of_notebooks = 15.00 * 50 = $750.00`\n2. Then it calculated the total cost for the ballpens:\n    `total_ballpen_cost = ballpen_cost * number_of_ballpens = 5.00 * 10 = $50.00`\n3. Finally, it added the total cost for the notebooks and the ballpens:\n    `total_spent = total_notebook_cost + total_ballpen_cost = 750.00 + 50.00 = $800.00`\n\nTherefore, William spent a total of $800.00. The solution from both Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor have been consistent. The final solution is that William spent $800.00.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{800}"
