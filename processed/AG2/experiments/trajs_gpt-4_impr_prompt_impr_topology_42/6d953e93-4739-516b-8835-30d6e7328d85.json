  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "Let's define the problem in terms of X, which is the unknown number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, thereby earning: \n6 * $60 (for the trucks tires) + 4 * $40 (for the car tires) = $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nWe know that the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. Therefore, we can say the earnings on Friday were: $520 - $40 = $480. \n\nGiven that the mechanic repaired only car tires on Friday and charged $40 for each, we can express this as: \nX * $40 = $480. \n\nTo find the number of car tires repaired on Friday (X), we need to solve this equation."
