      "content": "To solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to figure out how many rows will each type of tulip create. This is done by dividing the total number of a particular color of tulip by the number that can fit in a row. \n\n    - For the red tulips, there would be 36/6 = 6 rows.\n    \n    - For blue tulips, there would be 24/8 = 3 rows.\n    \n    - For yellow tulips, there would be 30/5 = 6 rows.\n\n2. Since the yellow tulips are placed between every row of red and blue tulips, the total number of rows the yellow tulips will create will be one less than the combined total rows of red and blue. \n\n    - This means, from our calculations above, we have a total of 6 (red) + 3 (blue) - 1 = 8 rows of yellow tulips instead of the calculated 6. We have to adjust this because we have more rows of red and blue tulips than yellow tulips.\n\n3. Adding up all the rows of each color, we get 6 (red) + 3 (blue) + 8 (adjusted yellow) = 17 total rows of flowers."

Therefore, there is no conflict to resolve in this stage. The approach used was to first calculate the number of rows for each color by dividing the total number of each color by the number that fits in each row. The total rows were computed by adding all the rows together, while adjusting the yellow quantity by taking into account that you place a yellow row between every row of red and blue tulips. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{17}**"
