In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Since Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark, and we know Richie scored 90 goals, it means Mark scored 90 - 30 = 60 goals.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of goals scored by Anna. Since Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna, and we know Richie scored 90 goals, it means Anna scored 90 - 55 = 35 goals.\n\nStep 3: Sum up all the goals scored by the three teenagers. Thus, the total number of goals scored is 90 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 185 goals.\n\nSo, the three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."
