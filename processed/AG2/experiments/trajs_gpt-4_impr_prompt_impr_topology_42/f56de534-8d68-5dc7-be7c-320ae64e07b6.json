The second set has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, which would be 3*500 = 1500 pieces.\n3. The third one has 1/4 the number of pieces, which is 1/4*500 = 125 pieces.\n4. The last one has 125 more pieces than the 500 piece one, which means 500 + 125 = 625 pieces.\n\nIn the end, we do the addition:\n\n500 (first set) + 1500 (second set) + 125 (third set) + 625 (fourth set) = total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up."
