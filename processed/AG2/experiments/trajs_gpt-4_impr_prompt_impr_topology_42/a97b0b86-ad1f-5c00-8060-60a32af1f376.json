Deduct the sum obtained in step 1 from the total amount Marie paid. \n3. The result from step 2 is the total cost of the pizzas. \n4. Finally, divide the cost of the pizzas by the cost of one box to find out the number of boxes Marie ordered. \n\nLet's do the calculations now. \n\n1. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3.5 = $17.5, and 4 apples cost 4 * $1.5 = $6. The total for these items is $12 + $17.5 + $6 = $35.5. \n2. We deduct this amount from the total Marie paid, which is $52.5 - $35.5 = $17.\n3. So, Marie spent $17 on pizza. \n4. If each box of pizza costs $8.5, then Marie ordered $17 / $8.5 = 2 boxes of pizza. \n\nSo, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."

By determining the total cost of the chicken meal, packs of milk, and apples, and subtracting this value from Marie's total payment, we were able to determine the amount spent on pizza. This was then divided by the cost of a single pizza box to find the number of pizza boxes bought, which was indeed accurately calculated as 2.

The problem-solving method and code provided by Agent Problem Solver and Agent Code Executor are in line with each other and are effectively the correct solution to the problem.\nBoth the problem-solving method and the Python code first calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples that Marie bought. They then subtract this total from Marie's total expenditures to determine the value of her pizza purchase. Finally, to find out the number of pizza boxes, they divide the value of the pizza purchase by the cost of a single pizza box. According to these calculations, Marie bought 2 pizza boxes. I confirm this as the accurate and correct solution."
