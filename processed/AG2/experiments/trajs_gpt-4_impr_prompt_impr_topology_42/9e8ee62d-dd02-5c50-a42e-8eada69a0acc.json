In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "The first step to solve this problem is to understand how the growth of the beanstalk was calculated over the weeks.\n\n1. In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.\n2. In the second week, the height of the beanstalk doubled. This means the height became 2 * 3 = 6 inches.\n3. The height of the beanstalk after the third week was given as 10 inches.\n\nTo get the growth in the third week, we subtract the height at the end of the second week from the height at the end of the third week. This means the growth in the third week is 10 - 6 = 4 inches. \n\nSo, the beanstalk grew 4 inches in the third week."
