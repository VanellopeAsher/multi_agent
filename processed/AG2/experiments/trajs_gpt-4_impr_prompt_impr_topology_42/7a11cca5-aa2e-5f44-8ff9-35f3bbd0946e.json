After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. So, it becomes 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.\n\n3. On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases to a total of 14000 gallons.\n\n4. Therefore, the total increase amount in the third day is 14000 (total) - 8000 (amount on the second day) = 6000 gallons. \n\nSo, the increase amount in the third day is 6000 gallons."
