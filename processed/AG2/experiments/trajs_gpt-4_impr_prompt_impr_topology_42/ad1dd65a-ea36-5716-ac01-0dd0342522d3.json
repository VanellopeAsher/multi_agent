In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the phones by multiplying the cost of one phone by the number of phones. The total cost of the phones will be 5 * $700 = $3500.\n2. Add the cost of the tablet and the headphones to the total cost of the phones. The new total cost will be $3500 + $330 + $137 = $3967.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the amount given to calculate the change. The change will be $4000 - $3967 = $33. This means the seller will give back $33 in change."

Finally, we calculate the change by subtracting `total_cost` from `amount_given`.\nLet's write this code."
