So if Ms. Thompson receives 84 messages, then we can get the number of messages Mr. Yu receives by dividing 84 by 3.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of messages\n\nThe total number of messages is the sum of the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu. So, to get the total, we add the number of messages delivered to each teacher together.\n"

Then we calculate the number of messages for Mr. Yu by dividing the number of messages for Ms. Thompson by 3.\n3. To find the total messages delivered, we just have to add the number of messages for Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.\n\n```python\n# define the number of messages for Ms. Thompson\nmsg_thompson = 84\n\n# calculate the number of messages for Mr. Yu\nmsg_yu = msg_thompson / 3\n\n# calculate the total messages delivered by adding the messages for Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu\ntotal_messages = msg_thompson + msg_yu\n\nprint(total_messages)\n```\nLet's see the execution of this."
