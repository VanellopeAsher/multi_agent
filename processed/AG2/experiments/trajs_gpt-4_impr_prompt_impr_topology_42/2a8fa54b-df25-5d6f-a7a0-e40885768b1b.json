The mean is defined as the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. In this case, Sally's mean score is given as 70, and she has 9 quizzes in total. Therefore, the sum of all her scores (including the forgotten one) would be 70 * 9 = 630.\n\nThe next step is to subtract the sum of the known scores from the total sum of all scores to find the value of the forgotten score.\n  \nSteps in solving the problem:\n1. Calculate the sum of the given scores.\n2. Multiply the mean by the total number of quizzes to get the sum of all the scores (including the forgotten score).\n3. Subtract the sum of the known scores from the total sum obtained in step 2. The result is the value of the forgotten score. \n\nLet's calculate this."

Then the computed total sum was subtracted by the sum of the known scores.\n\nBoth agents arrive at the same result: the forgotten score is 60.\n\nBoth usages of the formulas and Python program have helped to find the correct solution, and each step used exact values provided in the problem. Hence, it is safe to say the assumed solution is indeed valid. From my verification, I can affirm that no specific details were overlooked, and all constraints were met.\n\nHence, the final solution is: \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND [60]"
