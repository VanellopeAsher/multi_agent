      "content": "My proposed solution is as follows: \n\n1) First, Jessica needs to determine her total minimum payment by adding together the minimum payment for each debt. So, her total minimum payment is $3000 (student loans) + $2000 (credit card) + $5000 (mortgage) = $10,000/month.\n\n2) Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this minimum. To calculate this value, she needs to multiply the total minimum payment by 50% (or 0.5). This will give her the additional money she wants to pay over the minimum. \nSo, the extra amount she wants to pay is $10,000 * 0.50 = $5000/month. \n\n3) Now, to get the total amount Jessica plans to pay monthly, we add the total minimum payment to the extra amount. This yields $10,000 + $5000 = $15,000/month.\n\n4) Finally, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we can multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year (12). So, Jessica's annual payment would be $15,000 * 12 = $180,000/year. \n\nTherefore, Jessica will pay $180,000 on her debts in a year."
