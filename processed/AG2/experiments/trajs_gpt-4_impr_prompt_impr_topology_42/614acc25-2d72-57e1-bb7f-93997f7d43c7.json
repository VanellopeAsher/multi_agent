In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Then the number of wolves Rick killed today is 3x and the number of cougars is x-3.\n\nThe total number of animals Rick killed is obtained by summing all of these:\n\nAnimals killed first night = 10 (wolves) + x (cougars)\nAnimals killed second day = 3x (wolves) + (x-3) (cougars)\n\nSumming these two equations will give the total number of animals Rick killed.\n\nTotal animals = [10 + x] + [3x + x - 3], and we simplify this to:\nTotal animals = 4x + 7\n\nHowever, we need to know the value of x (number of cougars killed on the first night) to calculate the total animals. Currently, the information provided does not allow us to determine x. Hence, we cannot answer the question without this information.\n\nThe problem lacks crucial information to get an exact number. Could you provide the number of cougars Rick killed on the first night?"

Without knowing this, the total calculation cannot be resolved.\n  \n  ```python\n  # import sympy \n  import sympy as sp\n\n  # Define the variable\n  c = sp.symbols('c')\n\n  # first night wolves + first night cougars\n  first_night_animals = 10 + c\n\n  # second night wolves + second night cougars\n  second_night_animals = 3*c + (c - 3)\n\n  # total animals\n  total_animals = first_night_animals + second_night_animals\n\n  print(total_animals)\n  ```\n  This code will execute properly only when we have the value for 'c' (number of cougars killed on the first night). \nWithout that, we can't find the exact value for total_animals.\n\nIf you provide the value for 'c', we can proceed to calculate the total number of animals."
