This will give us the minimum number of classes that Manny needs to attend to meet his parents' requirement.\n\nFinally, we subtract this number from the total number of classes to get the number of classes that Manny can miss.\n\nLet's perform these calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum cost per class: $20\n2. Calculate the number of classes Manny needs to attend: $80 / $20 = 4 classes\n3. Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss: 12 total classes - 4 mandatory classes = 8 classes\n\nSo, Manny can miss 8 classes before his parents won't sign him up again."
