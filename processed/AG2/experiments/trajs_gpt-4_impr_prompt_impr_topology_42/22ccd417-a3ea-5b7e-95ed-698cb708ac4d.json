This means that the amount of medicine per dose is 448 mL/8 = 56 mL.\n\nSo in one dose, we have both types of medicine therefore, the equation will be:\n\nx + 3x = 56\n\nBy solving this equation, we will find the amount of the first medicine (x) Saanvi uses each time."

They are combined in the equation:\nx + 3*x = 56\n\n2- Agent_Code_Executor executes the equation accurately and provides the solution that x equals 14.\n\nBoth Agents are consistent with their solution and based their solution on given variables/data, no assumptions are made. The two solutions match each other perfectly, no conflicts are presented.\n\nTherefore, verifying the discussions and consultations, the final solution for the question \"How many mL of one medicine are combined by Saanvi each time?\" is 14 mL.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{14}."
