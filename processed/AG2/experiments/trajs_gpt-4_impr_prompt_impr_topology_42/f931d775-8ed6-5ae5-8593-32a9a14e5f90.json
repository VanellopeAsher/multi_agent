      "content": "The initial step is to determine the number of Sean's lines in each scene and song.\n\nIn the solo song, Sean has to memorize all of the lines. Thus, he has 54 lines to memorize for the solo song.\n\nFor the first scene, it has twice the number of lines as the solo song which means it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. As stated, Sean only has a third of the lines in this scene to memorize. Therefore, the lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.\n\nIn the second scene, it is told that the scene has six more lines than the solo song which implies the scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. It is further mentioned that four-fifths of the lines in this scene are Sean's which implies the lines Sean has to memorize for the second scene excluding the additional 15 lines is 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.\n\nSince an actor can't come, Sean has 15 additional lines to memorize for the scene. Thus, including these additional lines, the total lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene is 48 + 15 = 63 lines.\n\nThe total lines Sean has to memorize would be the sum of the lines he has to memorize in the solo song, the first scene and the second scene. That would be 54 + 36 + 63 = 153 lines. So, Sean has to memorize a total of 153 lines."
