Let's ask the user to provide the number of doughnuts Derrick makes and sells each day."

This measure is Derrick's daily earnings. \n  \nSo, daily earnings = Number of doughnuts * Cost of each doughnut = 150 * 2 = $300/day.\n\n**Step 2:** Multiply Derrick's daily profits by the number of days in June to find his total June earnings. \n\nSo, Derrick's total earnings for June = Daily earnings * Number of days in June = $300/day * 30 days = $9000. \n\nTherefore, if Derrick sells all his doughnuts every day in June, he would earn $9000 in that month."

We'll calculate daily earnings by multiplying the number of doughnuts made and sold each day by the price per doughnut.\n2. We'll multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in June to compute the total earnings for June.\n\nLet's execute this in Python...\n\n```python\n# The number of doughnuts Derrick makes and sells each day\ndoughnuts_per_day = 150\n\n# The price per doughnut \nprice_per_doughnut = 2  # in dollars\n\n# The number of days in June\ndays_in_June = 30\n\n# Daily earnings = Number of doughnuts * Price per doughnut\ndaily_earnings = doughnuts_per_day * price_per_doughnut\n\n# Total earnings for June = Daily earnings * Number of days in June\ntotal_earnings_June = daily_earnings * days_in_June\n\nprint(total_earnings_June)\n```\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Both solutions are based on the provided values of variables and do not make any invalid assumptions. The cost of each doughnut is $2, and Derrick makes and sells 150 doughnuts each day, resulting in daily earnings of $300. Over the 30-day period of June, this amounts to total earnings of $9000.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is: If Derrick sells all his doughnuts everyday in June, he would earn $9000.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{9000}."
