      "content": "My approach would apply the following steps:\n\n1) First, determine the total cost per bag for the trader. The trader buys each bag for $20 and spends an additional $2 on transport, totaling $22 per bag.\n\n2) Then, determine the trader's profit per bag. The trader sells each bag for $30, so after considering the total cost, the profit per bag is $30 - $22 equals $8.\n\n3) Finally, calculate the number of bags the farmer sold. If the total profit is $400, and each bag brought in a profit of $8, then the farmer sold $400 / $8 equals 50 bags.\n\nIn the end, the solution should be 50 bags if all computations are correct."
