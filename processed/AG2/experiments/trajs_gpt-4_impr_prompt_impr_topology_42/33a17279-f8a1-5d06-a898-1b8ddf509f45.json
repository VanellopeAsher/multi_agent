In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate total earnings from selling cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 = $240\n3. Sum up total earnings: $80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320\n4. Subtract the money given to Suzanne's sisters: $320 - $10 (for the first sister) - $10 (for the second sister) = $300\n5. Subtract the money donated to charity: $300 - $15 = $285\n\nHence, Suzanne should have $285 left from her earnings."
