      "content": "Yes, we can solve this problem by following these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.\n\n   She bought a dozen boxes, and since 1 dozen equals 12, she bought 12 boxes. Each box contains 20 oranges, hence 12 boxes will contain 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.\n\n2. Subtract the oranges she gave away.\n\n   She gifted 2 boxes each to her mother and her sibling. Since 1 box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 2 * 20 * 2 = 80 oranges.\n\n3. Calculate the remaining oranges.\n\n   This is done by subtracting the oranges given away from the initial total. That is, 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.\n\n4. Determine the ones she kept.\n\n   She kept 1/4 (or 25%) of the remaining oranges. Hence she retained 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.\n\n5. Determine the number of oranges she sold.\n\n   These are the remaining oranges after subtracting what she kept. That is, 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.\n\nSo Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."

Both methods are similar and they both calculated 120 as the number of oranges sold by Mrs. Harrington. \n\nAccording to the calculations:\n\n1. Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges with 20 oranges in each box. So, she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.\n\n2. She gifted her mother and sibling 2 boxes each. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 2 * 20 * 2 = 80 oranges.\n\n3. Therefore, she now had 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.\n\n4. She kept 1/4 of these oranges for herself. 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.\n\n5. She sold the rest of the oranges which were 160 - 40 = 120.\n\nThese steps were explained by both agents and also validated by the code execution. Both methods are correct, so we can conclude that Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{120}."
