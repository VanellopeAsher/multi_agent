      "content": "To solve this problem, you need to use basic arithmetic. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the tables: John sold 40 tables to Ali at a price of $200 each. Multiply the number of tables by the price per table (40 * $200).\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the roof frames: Similarly, measure the cost of the 20 roof frames. Here, each frame costs $100, so multiply the number of frames by the price per frame (20 * $100).\n\n3. Sum up the two amounts to get the total amount that Ali has to pay John. The total payment would be the cost of the tables plus the cost of the roof frames. \n\nOnce you've done the calculations, you'll have found the total amount Ali has to pay John."
