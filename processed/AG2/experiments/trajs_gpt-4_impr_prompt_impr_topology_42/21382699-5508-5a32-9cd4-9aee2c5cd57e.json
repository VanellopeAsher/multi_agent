Set up a proportion to solve for Darrell and Allen's current ages. \n\n    Let x be the common ratio for their ages. \n    \n    We know that Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. \n\n2. We are given that their total age is 162. So, we can use this fact to formulate a linear equation that can be solved:\n\n    7x (Darrell's age) + 11x (Allen's age) = 162.\n    \n    Simplifying this equation gives us 18x = 162.\n\n3. Next, we solve for x. \n\n4. Once we have the value of x, we would substitute x into the equation for Allen's age to get his current age.\n\n5. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age."

The ratio method adopted to find the value of x via the given equation `18*x = 162` seems correct and in line with the information provided in the problem. \n\nGiven the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162 years, it was determined that the value of x, which represents the ratio between their ages is 9. Allen's current age was calculated as 99 years, and Allen's age 10 years from now was correctly concluded to be 109 years by adding 10 to his current age.\n\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109 years.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{109}**."
