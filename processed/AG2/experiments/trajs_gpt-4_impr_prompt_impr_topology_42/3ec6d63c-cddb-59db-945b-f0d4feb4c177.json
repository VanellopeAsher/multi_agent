After obtaining the total number of bucks, we calculate the number of 6 point bucks, which are 50% of all bucks.\nNow, let's calculate these values in Python.\n\n1. Multiply 80 by 0.3 to get the number of bucks.\n2. Multiply the resulting number by 0.5 to find the number of 6-point bucks.\n\nThe Python code will be:\n\n```python\ntotal_deer = 80\nbucks_percentage = 0.3\nsix_point_percentage = 0.5\n\n# Calculate the total number of bucks\ntotal_bucks = total_deer * bucks_percentage\n\n# Calculate the number of 6 point bucks\nsix_point_bucks = total_bucks * six_point_percentage\n\nprint(six_point_bucks)\n``` \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor\n\n"

That is, we multiply 80 by 30/100 = 0.30.\n\n2. After getting the total number of bucks, we then find out how many are 6-point bucks. According to the problem, 50% of the bucks are 6-point bucks. To get this, we find 50% of the total number of bucks we calculated in step 1. That is, we multiply the result from step 1 by 50/100 = 0.50.\n\nIn summary, to get the number of 6-point bucks, we multiply the total number of deer by the percentage that are bucks, and then multiply that result by the percentage of bucks that are 6-point bucks.\n\nThis solution agrees with the Python code execution done by Agent_Code_Executor. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent_Verifier."

They opt to calculate the total number of bucks from the total deer, and then use that figure to find the count of six-point bucks. The Python code, as well as the procedural proposal, reached consistent outcomes.\n\nHence the confirmed response is 12 six-point bucks. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}**."
