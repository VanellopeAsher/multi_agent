Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Calculate the total cost of the goats: This is done by multiplying the price of a goat ($500) by the number of goats bought (3).\n2. Calculate the total cost of the cows: This is done by multiplying the price of a cow ($1500) by the number of cows bought (2).\n3. Then, add up the total cost of the goats and cows. This gives the total amount of money spent by John at the market."
