By adding the number of cherries Richard and Robert had, and subtracting from 6000, we can find the number of cherries Jerry had.\n\nFinally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of cherries Richard had: Robert's cherries - 1000.\n2. Determine the number of cherries Jerry had: Total cherries - (Richard's + Robert's cherries).\n3. Determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry: Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries."

So Jerry has 6000 - 3000 - 2000 = 1000 cherries.\n\nNow, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we just subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's.\n\nSo, Robert has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 cherries more than Jerry. \n\nThe final answer is 2000."

He/she followed the steps and gauged correctly that Robert has 3000 cherries, and that he has 1000 more than Richard, meaning Richard has 2000 cherries. From the total of 6000, we subtract Richard's and Robert's cherries to find out Jerry's amount. Robert's cherries minus Jerry's cherries give us the answer, which is how much more Robert has than Jerry. \n\nIn the case of Agent Code Executor, he/she has suggested to implement the exact same steps that were laid out by the Problem Solver in Python code which gave the result as 2000 cherries, which matches the solution given by the Problem Solver.\n\nHence, cross-verifying both correlations, the final solution is consistent. Robert has 2000 more cherries than Jerry. \n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: 2000"
