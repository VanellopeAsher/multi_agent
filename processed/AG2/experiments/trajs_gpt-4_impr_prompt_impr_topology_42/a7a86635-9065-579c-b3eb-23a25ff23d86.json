In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 600 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?",

Therefore, the number of boys is 200/2 =100 and the same number for girls. \n\n2. Each boy collected 600 seashells.\n\n3. Each girl collected the number of seashells equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\n\nGiven the above points, we can calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl as follow:\n\n- Number of shells brought by each boy = 600 shells\n- Number of shells brought by each girl = Number of shells brought by each boy + 4 times the number of shells brought by each boy = 600 + 4*600\n\nNow we just need to perform the calculation."

This includes the 600 seashells equivalent to what the boys brought plus additional four times as many seashells as the boys (which is 2400). So, 600 + 2400 = 3000 seashells. This aligns correctly with the problem statement that each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\nLet's discuss and decide if this solution is final."
