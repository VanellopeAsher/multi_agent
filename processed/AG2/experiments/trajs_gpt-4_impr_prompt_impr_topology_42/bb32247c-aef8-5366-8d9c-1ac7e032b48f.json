Initial height in the first week = x inches.\n    2. Height after the second week = 2*x inches (since it doubled).\n    3. Height after the third week = 2*x+4 inches (it grew an additional 4 inches).\n\nSo, assuming the initial height of the beanstalk in the first week was 'x' inches, the total height after 3 weeks would be 2*x + 4 inches. \n\nIn the absence of exact values, however, we cannot derive a concrete answer."

Assuming this unknown initial height (week 1) is 'x', in week 2 the height doubles making it 2x, and by week 3 it has grown by an additional 4 inches, thus making the height 2x + 4.\n\nAlthough we can write these calculations in code, it's important to note that we don't have the initial value for 'x' and therefore can't calculate the exact final height.\n\n```python\n# the initial height is not given.\n# assuming initial height in the first week (x)\nx = None  # Assuming we don't know the value of x\n\n# The height doubled in the second week\nheight_after_second_week = 2 * x\n\n# The beanstalk grew another 4 inches in the third week\nheight_after_third_week = height_after_second_week + 4\n\nprint(height_after_third_week)\n```\nIn the above code, because `x` is `None`, running it would result in a `TypeError`.\n\nThus, without the initial height of the beanstalk (the value of x), we can't compute the height after three weeks."

Agent Code Executor concurred with this approach, albeit noting that they can't code this without an initial value for 'x'.\n\nThe attempted code execution failed due to a TypeError, as expected, because a 'None' type cannot be used in mathematical operations.
