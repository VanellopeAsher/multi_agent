Second, let's calculate the total money made from the nine burger platters. He sells nine burgers at $11.5 each, so the total is 9 * $11.5.\n3. Third, let's calculate how much money he made from the sodas. He sells half of 40 sodas, which is 20 sodas. The cost for each soda is $1.50, so the total is 20 * $1.50.\n4. Lastly, let's add up all the money from the milkshakes, the burgers, and the sodas to get the total amount of money Terry made. \n\nSo, Total Money Made = Total from Milkshakes + Total from Burgers + Total from Sodas."
