      "content": "Here is how I would solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: First, establish the total length of the remoras. Benny saw 2 remoras, each measuring 6 inches, so we multiply 2 by 6 to find the total length of the remoras. \n\nStep 2: We know that the total length of the remoras accounts for 10% of the shark's body length. Therefore, to find the shark's body length, we divide the total length of the remoras by 0.10 (which represents 10%).\n\nThese steps should allow us to calculate the length of the shark."

They accurately calculated the total length of the remoras by doing the simple multiplication 2*6. They then used that value to calculate the length of the shark by dividing the total length of the remoras by 0.1 (representing 10%).\n\nTheir combined solution suggests that the shark's length is 120 inches.\n\nHaving seen no errors or missing considerations in their solutions, I agree with their conclusion. \n\nHence, the final solution is: \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{120.0}** (the shark's length in inches)."
