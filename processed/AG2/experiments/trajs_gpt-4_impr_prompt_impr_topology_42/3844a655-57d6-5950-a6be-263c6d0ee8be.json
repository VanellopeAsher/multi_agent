      "content": "1. Define the equations for the cost of the two venues. \n\nFor the first venue, the cost is $2000 plus $50 times the number of guests. This can be written mathematically as:\n\n    C1 = 2000 + 50x  \n\nwhere C1 is the cost of the first venue, and x is the number of guests.\n\nFor the second venue, the cost is $250 times the number of guests. This can be represented as:\n\n    C2 = 250x \n\nwhere C2 is the cost of the second venue.\n\n2. To solve for the number of guests that would make both venues equal in cost, you set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x using algebraic methods:\n\n    2000 + 50x = 250x \n\n3. To isolate x, subtract 50x from both sides:\n\n    2000 = 200x \n\n4. Then divide both sides by 200 to solve for x:\n\n    x = 2000 / 200 \n\n5. This gives us the number of guests at which both venues are of equal cost. \n\nRemember to round your answer accordingly based on the context of the problem if you're dealing with real-world scenarios where a fractional guest would not make sense. \n\nLet's discuss this solution plan."
