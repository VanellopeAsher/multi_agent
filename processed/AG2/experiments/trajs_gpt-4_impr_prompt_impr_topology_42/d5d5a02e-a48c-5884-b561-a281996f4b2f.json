      "content": "Step 1: Identify the Knowns and Unknowns\n\nLet's denote the current age of Emil's dad as `D` and the current age of Emil's brother as `B`. We know that:\n\n    a. Emil is 21 years old now.\n    b. Emil will be 26 years old in 5 years.\n    \nFrom the problem, we understand that:\n\n    i. When Emil turns 26 (i.e., in 5 years), he will be half the age of his dad. Therefore, his dad's age at that time will be 2 * 26 = 52 years old.\n    ii. When Emil turns 26, he will also be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, his brother's age at that time will be 26 / 2 = 13 years old.\n\nStep 2: Derive the Current Ages of Emil's Dad and Brother\n\nSince the ages we derived in the previous step are the ages of Emil's dad and brother in 5 years, we can determine their current ages by subtracting 5 from those ages:\n\n     a. Current age of Emil's dad (D) = 52 - 5 = 47 years old\n     b. Current age of Emil's brother (B) = 13 - 5 = 8 years old\n\nStep 3: Sum of Current Ages\n\nThe sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is D + B = 47 + 8 = 55 years old. So, the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 55 years."

      "content": "Alright, first let's define our known and unknown variables. \n\nEmil's current age is 21 years old.\n\nLet `D` represent his dad's current age and `B` represent his brother's current age.\n\nIn 5 years, Emil will be 26 years old. So,\n- Emil's dad's age will be twice Emil's age, so his dad's age in 5 years will be 2*26 = 52 years old.\n- Emil's brother's age will be half of Emil's age, so his brother's age in 5 years will be 26/2 = 13 years old.\n\nSubtract 5 years from these ages to get their current ages:\n- Emil's dad's current age: 52 - 5 = 47 years old\n- Emil's brother's current age: 13 - 5 = 8 years old\n\nThen, we add these ages together to find the sum of their current ages. \n\nThis can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define Emil's age\nemil_age = 21\n\n# Calculate his dad's age in 5 years\ndad_age_in_5_years = 2 * (emil_age + 5)\n\n# Calculate his brother's age in 5 years\nbrother_age_in_5_years = (emil_age + 5) / 2\n\n# Find their current ages\ndad_current_age = dad_age_in_5_years - 5\nbrother_current_age = brother_age_in_5_years - 5\n\n# Add their ages to find the sum\nsum_ages = dad_current_age + brother_current_age\nprint(sum_ages)\n```\n\nYou could also you sympy to solve this problem, but it quite straightforward to solve directly."
