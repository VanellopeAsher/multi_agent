Determine the price of the half-gallon jar:\n   \n   * According to the problem, a jar of one gallon costs $2 more than a jar of half a gallon. So, subtract $2 from the price of the one-gallon jar, that is $5, to get the price of the half-gallon jar.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of one-gallon jars and half-gallon jars:\n\n   * Multiply the price of the one-gallon jar by the number of one-gallon jars Cecelia bought (10 jars) to find the total cost of one-gallon jars.\n   \n   * Similarly, multiply the price of the half-gallon jar by the number of half-gallon jars Cecelia bought (16 jars) to find the total cost of half-gallon jars.\n\n3. Finally, add up the total costs of the one-gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to get the total expense."
