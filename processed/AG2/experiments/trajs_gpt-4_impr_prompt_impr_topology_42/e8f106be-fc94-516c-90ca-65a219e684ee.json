His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. He also has a tree in the middle of the yard that is 10 feet tall, but he doesn't want to hang any streamers on the tree. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy for his fence?",

      "content": "First, we need to find out the total length of the backyard fence. We can calculate this using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is 2 * (length + width). Here, the length of the rectangle is 20 feet, while the width is 15 feet. Therefore, the perimeter is 2 * (20 + 15), giving us 70 feet.\n\nJames will not place any streamers on the tree, so the height of the tree isn't relevant to our calculation.\n\nIn conclusion, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
