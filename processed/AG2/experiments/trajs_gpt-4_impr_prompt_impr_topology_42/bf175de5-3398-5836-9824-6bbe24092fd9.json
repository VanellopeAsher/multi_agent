      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll need to use the concept of work rate, which is the rate at which someone can complete a task.\n\n1. Identify the work rate of one individual:\n    - One person can paint half the house in 5 days. \n    - Therefore, one person can paint the whole house in 10 days (**because 5 days * 2 = 10 days**)\n    - We need to convert this to hours, since the question asks us for the time in hours. There are 24 hours in a day. Therefore, one person can paint the house in 240 hours (**because 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours**)\n\n2. Determine the work rate of the team:\n    - If one person can paint a house in 240 hours, then the combined rate of the five individuals is 5 times the rate of one person. Everyone's working simultaneously, so their rates add up. In other words, the team can paint 5 houses in the same time it takes one person to paint one house. \n\n3. Calculate the time it takes the team to paint the whole house:\n    - If the team can paint 5 houses in 240 hours, they can paint one house in a fifth of that time. **So, divide the time it takes one person to paint a house (240 hours) by the number of people in the team (5).** \n\n4. The result will give the number of hours it will take a team of 5 individuals to paint a whole house."
