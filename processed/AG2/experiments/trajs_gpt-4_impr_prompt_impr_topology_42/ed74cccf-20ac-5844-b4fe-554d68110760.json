In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here is how I would solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: First, establish the number of students who are participating in each sport.\n- We are told directly that there are 6 students playing tennis.\n- For volleyball, we are told that it is twice the number of those playing tennis, so there are 2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball.\n- For soccer, we are not given a number but we are told that they are a mixture of boys and girls, with 22 of them being girls.\n\nStep 2: We are then asked to find the total number of students who are playing sports. That's the sum of the number of students playing each sport:\n\nThe total number of students will be the number of students playing tennis + number of students playing volleyball + number of girls (which is the total number of students playing soccer, as provided).\n\nIn mathematical terms, if T is the number of students playing tennis, V is the number of students playing volleyball, and S is the number of students playing soccer, the total number of students will be T + V + S. \n\nWe know T = 6, V = 12, and S = 22, so the total number of students equals 6 + 12 + 22. \n\nPlease note that the calculation assumes that no student is playing more than one sport. This assumption is based on the information provided in the question. \n\nNow we can do the math!"
