In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

After the conversion, divide the total length of the wire by the number of pieces to get the length of each piece. \n\nBy using these steps, we can find the length of each piece of wire."

There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can do this conversion by multiplication.\n\n2. Divide the total length of the wire (in inches) by the number of pieces to find the length of each individual piece.\n\nLet's implement this."
