According to the problem, milk, eggs, cookies, and water are food items, while light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items.\n \n2. Next, calculate the total cost for both types of items.\n- For food items: add up the cost of milk ($2), eggs ($3), cookies ($2), and water ($1). The total cost of food items is $2 + $3 + $2 + $1 = $8.\n- For non-food items: add up the cost of light bulbs ($3), cups ($3), and roach traps ($4). The total cost of non-food items is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.\n\n3. Apply a 10% tax to the cost of non-food items: $10 * 0.10 = $1. \n\n4. Finally, find the total cost of all items by adding up the cost of food items, the cost of non-food items, and the tax on non-food items. This gives a final total of $8 + $10 + $1 = $19. \n\nSo, everything cost $19."
