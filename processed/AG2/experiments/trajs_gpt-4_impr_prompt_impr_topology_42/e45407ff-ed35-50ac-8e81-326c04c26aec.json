In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

So, each cognac bottle costs $60 + 50% of $60 = $90. \n\nThe total cost for the bottles of Cognac is then 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800. \n\nThe total amount spent on all the liquor is the sum of the cost of the Scotch and the Cognac which is $600 (for Scotch) + $1800 (for cognac) = $2400.\nNow let's engage the other agents in discussion."
