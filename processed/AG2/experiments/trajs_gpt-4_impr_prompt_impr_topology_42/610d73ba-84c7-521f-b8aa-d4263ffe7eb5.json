P = 4 miles (the distance Paisley ran),\n2. R = 5*P (Reggie ran a distance that was five times the distance that Paisley ran),\n3. R = L + 3 miles (Reggie ran also 3 miles more than what Lynn ran).\n\nSubstituting the given values and expressions into the equations, we can solve for L (the distance that Lynn ran).\n\nFollowing algebraic operations lead to the solution:\n- Substitute P = 4 into R = 5*P to get R = 5*4 = 20,\n- Substitute R = 20 into R = L + 3 to get 20 = L + 3,\n- Solve for L: L = 20 - 3 = 17.\n\nSo, Lynn ran 17 miles."
