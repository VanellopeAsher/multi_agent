In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

We know Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so multiply 10 pounds/month by 3 months.\n2. Calculate the total weight gained during recovery. We're told he gained 5 pounds per month for 2 months, so multiply 5 pounds/month by 2 months.\n3. His final weight after recovery was 70 pounds. To know his weight before he started losing, we will add the total weight loss and recovery gain to his final weight. \n\nThe sum of these calculations will give us Mark's initial weight."
