On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to add up the total number of hours Frankie spent watching TV. Here's how to calculate it:\n\n1. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour-long episode each night, which equals 2 hours in total.\n2. On Wednesday, he watched three 30-minute episodes which equals 1.5 hours (because 3 * 30 minutes = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours).\n3. On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours of TV (an hour of episodes and a 30-minute show).\n4. On Friday, he watched two one-hour episodes which is 2 hours in total.\n\nTherefore, by summing up the hours, we get the total amount of time Frankie spent watching TV. Let's calculate it now."

Both used the given information accurately, without assumptions. Adding up the hours Frankie watched from Monday to Friday indeed gives us 2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7 hours, which matches the output of Agent Code Executor's code.\n\nTherefore, the final solution to this problem is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{7}**\n\nSo, Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total."
