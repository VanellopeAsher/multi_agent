Add the ages of the two brothers and all the sisters to find the total age of the siblings.\n\nLet's write the Python code for these steps. \n\n```python\n# Age of the younger brother\nyounger_brother_age = 12\n\n# Age of the older brother which is twice the age of the younger brother\nolder_brother_age = younger_brother_age * 2\n\n# Total age of the sisters\ntotal_sisters_age = 10 * 16\n\n# Total age of all the siblings\ntotal_age = younger_brother_age + older_brother_age + total_sisters_age\n\nprint(total_age)\n```\n\nWe can expect the output to be 196, which is the total age of all the siblings."
