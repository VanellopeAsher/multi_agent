      "content": "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Identify the height of the second tree.\n        The second tree is 50 feet higher than the shortest tree. The shortest tree is 60 feet high, so the second tree is 60 feet + 50 feet = 110 feet high.\n\nStep 2: Find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree.\n        The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is 60 feet (height of the shortest tree) + 110 feet (height of the second tree) = 170 feet.\n        \nStep 3: Determine the height of the tallest tree.\n        The tallest tree is twice as high as the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 2 * 170 feet = 340 feet.\n\nSo, the height of the tallest tree is 340 feet."

      "content": "In Python, this problem can be solved using the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Declare a variable and assign the height of the shortest tree to it. In this case, `shortest_tree_height` = 60 (in feet).\n\nStep 2: Declare a second variable for the height of the second tree, which is 50 feet more than the height of the shortest tree. Therefore, `second_tree_height` = `shortest_tree_height` + 50.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second tree using the formula `combined_height` = `shortest_tree_height` + `second_tree_height`.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the height of the tallest tree. According to the question, the height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the other two trees. So, `tallest_tree_height` = 2 * `combined_height`.\n\nLet's execute this in Python to get the final result. \n\n```python\n# declare the variable for the shortest tree height\nshortest_tree_height = 60\n\n# calculate the height of the second tree\nsecond_tree_height = shortest_tree_height + 50\n\n# calculate the combined height of the shortest and the second tree\ncombined_height = shortest_tree_height + second_tree_height\n\n# calculate the height of the tallest tree\ntallest_tree_height = 2 * combined_height\n\n# print the height of the tallest tree\nprint(tallest_tree_height)\n```\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
