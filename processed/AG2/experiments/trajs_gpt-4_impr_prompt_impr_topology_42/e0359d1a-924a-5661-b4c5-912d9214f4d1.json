In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of candy: This is the sum of the amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have. Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.\n\n2. Identify the number of people sharing the candy: The candy is being split between Robert, Cindy, and Aaron which makes it 3 people.\n\n3. Determine how much candy each person would receive: We do this by dividing the total amount of candy by the number of people sharing it. So, each person would have 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.\n\nIn conclusion, Robert, Cindy, and Aaron would each have 4 pounds of candy. \n\nLet's have this verified by the Agent Code Executor through coding."

Both solutions calculated the total amount of candy available, which is 3 lbs from Robert, 5 lbs from Cindy, and 4 lbs from Aaron, summing up to 12 lbs in total. It was then evenly distributed among the 3 individuals, with each receiving 4 lbs of candy. The code execution also ended successfully, with the output confirming that each would indeed receive 4 lbs of candy. Therefore, the final solution is correct.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND: \\boxed{4}."
