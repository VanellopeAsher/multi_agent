Determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can assign to each present's bow by dividing the total number of inches of ribbon she has by the number of presents.\n\nLet's now detail these steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of presents Monica has\nThe total number of presents is the sum of presents for her family members, her friends, and her teachers.\nSo, she has 6 (for family) + 4 (for buddies) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 presents in total.\n\nStep 2: Determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can assign to each present's bow\nTo determine the amount of ribbon she can assign to each present's bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon she has by the number of presents.\nSo, she can assign 144 inches (total length of ribbon) / 12 (total number of presents) = 12 inches of ribbon to each present's bow. \n\nSo, Monica can allocate 12 inches of ribbon to each present's bow."
