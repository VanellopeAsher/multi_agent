In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

This means `x + x + 2x = 500`, which simplifies to `4x = 500`.\n\n3. Solving for `x`, we divide 500 by 4 to get `x = 125`. \n\nThus, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday."

This equation was then solved for `x`.\n\nThus, the final solution I can verify is that they make **125 chimichangas** on Tuesday. \n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{125}**."
