At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, decreasing the total to 40 passengers.\n3. Then, 5 times the number of people who got off (which is 8 * 5 = 40) get on the bus, increasing the total to 80 passengers.\n4. Before the bus departs, 2 people decide to get off, decreasing the total to 78 passengers.\n5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, decreasing the total to 57 passengers.\n6. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than got off. This is equivalent to the number of passengers who got off divided by 3, which is 21 / 3 = 7. These passengers get on the bus, increasing the total to 64 passengers.\n\nTherefore, 64 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop."

      "content": "Let's calculate this step by step in Python:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of passengers on the bus.\n2. Subtract the passengers that got off at the first stop.\n3. Add the passengers that got on at the first stop.\n4. Subtract the passengers that changed their minds and got off before the bus left the first stop.\n5. Subtract the passengers that got off at the second stop.\n6. Add the passengers that got on at the second stop.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# start with the initial number of passengers on the bus\npassengers = 48\n\n# at the first stop, 8 passengers get off\npassengers -= 8\n\n# 5 times the number of people who got off (which is 8 * 5 = 40) get on the bus\npassengers += 8 * 5\n\n# 2 people who just got on at the first stop decide to get off again\npassengers -= 2\n\n# at the second stop, 21 passengers get off\npassengers -= 21\n\n# 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than got off at the second stop\npassengers += 21 // 3\n\nprint(passengers)\n``` \n\nNote that we use integer division (//) for the last calculation to ensure we work with whole numbers of passengers. After all, you can't really have a fractional passenger on a bus.\n\nLet's execute the above python code to find out the answer. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor."
