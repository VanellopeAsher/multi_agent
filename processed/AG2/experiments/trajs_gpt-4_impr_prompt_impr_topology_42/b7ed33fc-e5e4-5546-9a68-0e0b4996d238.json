      "content": "The problem states that John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. So, we can say that he drinks 1 bottle of water per 30 minutes.\n\nWe are also given that:\n- A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes. Which means he would consume 1 bottle of water while solving it (**30 minutes/30 minutes X 1 bottle = 1 bottle**).\n- An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 3 times as long as a normal Sudoku puzzle, which is **3 X 30 minutes = 90 minutes**. Thus, he would consume **90 minutes/30 minutes X 1 bottle = 3 bottles** while solving the extreme Sudoku puzzle.\n\nThe total number of bottles John drinks while solving both puzzles is found by adding the two quantities together, which gives **1 bottle (from the normal Sudoku puzzle) + 3 bottles (from the extreme Sudoku puzzle) = 4 bottles**.\n\nSo, John drinks 4 bottles of water in the time it takes him to complete both puzzles."

It should print `4.0` given our calculations from before.\n\nNote that the precision of available information only permits us to state that 4 bottles of water were consumed in the process, not 4.0 - the extra decimal point does not convey any additional information in this case and could be misleading. Here, `print(int(total_bottles))` would be more reasonable, outputting `4` instead of `4.0`.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
