In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

So, the remaining amount becomes $4501.5 - $600 = $3901.5.\n\nLastly, to find out how long George needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to pay by his hourly wage.\n\nStep 4: The number of hours George needs to work would be $3901.5 / $15.3.\n\nLet's calculate the exact number of hours."

It uses the math.ceil function to round up the total number of hours (as it is not possible to work a fraction of an hour), and outputs the correct result of 255 hours. \n\nSo, our final synthesis: George needs to work for 255 hours to earn enough to pay for his dental work."
