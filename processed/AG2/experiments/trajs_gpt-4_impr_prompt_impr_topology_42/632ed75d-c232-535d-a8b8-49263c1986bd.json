The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day. Can you determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France?",

      "content": "Sure, here's how I would solve this problem:\n\n1. We know the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft is twice the number of flights made by the second aircraft, as it mentioned \"44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day\". So, the total number of flights made by the first aircraft would be 44*2 = 88 flights.\n\n2. Now, we know that the first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights. This amounts to 3/4 *88 = 66 flights to Greece.\n\n3. The rest of the flights by the first aircraft, which are not to Greece, are evenly divided between France and Germany. Hence, the number of flights to France would be (Total flights – Flights to Greece)/2 = (88 – 66)/2 = 11 flights to France.\n\nSo, the first aircraft makes 11 daily flights to France."
