For red tulips: he buys 3.6 times of ten red tulips, so the total number will be 3.6 * 10 = 36 red tulips.\n2. For blue tulips: he buys 2.4 times of ten blue tulips, so the total number will be 2.4 * 10 = 24 blue tulips.\n\nSecond, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color:\n\n3. Red rows: Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row, so the number of red rows is 36 red tulips / 6 = 6 rows.\n4. Blue rows: Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, so the number of blue rows is 24 blue tulips / 8 = 3 rows.\n\nFinally, to get the total number of rows he will plant, sum up the number of red rows and blue rows:\n\n5. Total rows = Red rows + Blue rows = 6 rows + 3 rows = 9 rows. So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."

We know that Jackson is buying 2.4 times of ten blue tulips, so multiply 2.4 by 10 to get 24 blue tulips.\n3. Determine the number of rows for red tulips. We know that Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in one row, so divide 36 (the total number of red tulips) by 6 to get 6 rows.\n4. Determine the number of rows for blue tulips. We know that Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in one row, so divide 24 (the total number of blue tulips) by 8 to get 3 rows.\n5.
