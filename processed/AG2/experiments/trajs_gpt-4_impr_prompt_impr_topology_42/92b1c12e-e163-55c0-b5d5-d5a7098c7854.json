In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Let's denote the age of Carver's daughter as \"d\" and the age of Carver's son as \"s\".\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. Carver's age (45) is equal to twice the age of his daughter minus 5, or 2d - 5. We can write this as: 2d - 5 = 45.\n2. The age of Carver's daughter is equal to three times the age of his son plus 4, or 3s+4. We can write this as: d = 3s + 4.\n\nWe can now solve these two equations to find the age of the son. Let's start with the first equation:\n2d = 45+5\n2d = 50\nd = 50/2\nd = 25\n\nNow we substitute d = 25 into the second equation:\n25 = 3s + 4\n3s = 25 - 4\n3s = 21\ns = 21/3\ns = 7\n\nTherefore, Carver's son is 7 years old."
