In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of balloons filled by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack. That would be 10 * 100 = 1000 balloons.\n\n2. Subtract the number of balloons left (120) from the total number of balloons filled (1000). The resulting figure should give us the number of balloons that were thrown: 1000 - 120 = 880.\n\nSo, 880 balloons were thrown."

The calculation based on the original problem statement is correctly conducted as 1000 (from 10 packs of 100 balloons each) minus 120 (balloons left), which equals 880. Therefore, the number of water balloons thrown is 880.\n\nSOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{880}."
