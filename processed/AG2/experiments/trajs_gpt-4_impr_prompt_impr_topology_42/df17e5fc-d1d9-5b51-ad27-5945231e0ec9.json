We know that half of the mural is coloured yellow, so half of the total paint used (12 pints) will be yellow. This is computed as 1/2 * total paint, that is, 1/2 * 12 pints.\n\n2. Second, compute the volume of the rest of the paint (red, white, and purple), which would be total paint - yellow paint.\n\n3. Lastly, since red, white, and purple paints are utilized in equal quantities, we can get the amount of red paint by evenly splitting the total amount of these three paints by 3. \n\nWe can follow these steps to determine how many pints of red paint were used."

The code calculated the quantity of yellow paint used first, which is half of the total paint (12 pints), resulting in 6 pints of yellow paint. The difference between the total paint and the yellow paint quantities yielded 6 pints, which represents the amount of the remaining colors (red, white, and purple). Since these colors are uniformly distributed, each one takes up a third of this quantity, hence, 2 pints for each color.\n\nSince both the Python code solution and Problem Solver's guidelines are in alignment and are logically sound, the conclusion holds: 2 pints of red paint were used for the mural painting."
