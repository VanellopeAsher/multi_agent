This is given as 3 months.\nStep 2: Multiply this number (3) by the weight Mark lost each month, which is 10 pounds. The calculation gives us 30 pounds.\nStep 3: Add this figure (30 pounds) to his final weight (70 pounds) to get his initial weight. The solution will be 70 pounds + 30 pounds which equals 100 pounds.\n\nTherefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."

Next, we multiply this by the weight that Mark lost each month (10 pounds). \n3. Finally, we add this total weight loss to his final weight of 70 pounds to find his initial weight.\n\n```python\n# Number of months Mark was unwell\nmonths_unwell = 3\n\n# Weight loss per month in pounds\nweight_loss_per_month = 10\n\n# Marks final weight in pounds\nfinal_weight = 70\n\n# Calculate total weight loss\ntotal_weight_loss = months_unwell * weight_loss_per_month\n\n# Calculate initial weight\ninitial_weight = final_weight + total_weight_loss\n\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nWhen we run the above code, we should get the initial weight which is 100 pounds.\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

After analysing their proposals: \n\n- Agent Problem Solver proposed using a clear, simple method, which involved multiplying the number of months Mark was unwell by his monthly weight loss, and adding this to his final weight. This resulted in an initial weight of 100 pounds.\n- Agent Code Executor generated Python code which also implemented the same steps and obtained the same solution.\n\nTherefore, as both agreed on the same approach and reached the same result, I can conclude that their solution is correct.
