You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nLeah just got a new kitten.

So, total vaccine cost = 3*20. We then need to calculate the cost after a 10% discount.\nCost of each broken vase = $12, and there are 4 vases in total. So, total cost of broken vases = 4*12.\n\nLet's write a python code to calculate the total cost.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# cost of spaying\ncost_spaying = 200\n\n# cost of vaccines before discount\ncost_vaccine_before_discount = 3 * 20\n\n# apply 10% discount on vaccine cost\ncost_vaccine_after_discount = cost_vaccine_before_discount * (1 - 10/100)\n\n# cost of broken vases\ncost_broken_vases = 4 * 12\n\n# total cost is sum of all costs\ntotal_cost = cost_spaying + cost_vaccine_after_discount + cost_broken_vases\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nLet's run this Python code to get the total cost."
