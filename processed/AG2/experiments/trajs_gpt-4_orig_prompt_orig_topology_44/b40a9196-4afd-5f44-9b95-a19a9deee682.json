You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn purchases milk at a cost of 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

      "content": "First, let's classify the items purchased by John into two categories: food items and non-food items. The food items John purchased are milk and eggs, and the non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. \n\nSince tax is only applied to non-food items, we can find the total cost of John's purchases by summing up the costs of the food items and the non-food items (including tax). The tax applied to the non-food items is 10% of their total cost. \n\nHere's the Python code that will perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# your code\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# cost of food items\ncost_food = 2 + 3\n\n# cost of non-food items before tax\ncost_non_food = 3 + 3 + 4\n\n# calculate tax on non-food items\ntax = cost_non_food * 0.10\n\n# calculate total cost \ntotal_cost = cost_food + cost_non_food + tax\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis program calculates the total cost of all items purchased by John, including tax applied to non-food items."
