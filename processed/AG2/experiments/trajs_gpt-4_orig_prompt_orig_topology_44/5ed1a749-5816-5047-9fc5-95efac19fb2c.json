You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.

According to the problem, the number of pieces in the second box is 3x and the number of pieces in the third box is 1/4x. Johnny picks up all the legos, so he picks up x + 3x + 1/4x legos in total.\n\nCase 1: We can use Python to solve the equation.

But, by simplifying the expression above, we can determine a general formula for the total number of blocks Johnny picks up based on the number of blocks in the first set.\n\nNow, let's write Python code to simplify this expression:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\nx = symbols('x')\n\ntotal_legos = x + 3*x + 1/4*x\n\nsimplified_total = simplify(total_legos)\n\nprint(simplified_total)\n```\n\nWe hope this code will give us a simplified form of the total number of legos Johnny picked up."
