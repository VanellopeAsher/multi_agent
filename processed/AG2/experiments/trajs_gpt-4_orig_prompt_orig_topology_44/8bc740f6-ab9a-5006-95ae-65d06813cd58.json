You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.

The two totals are then added together for the overall total.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# number of articles published daily by the first and the second websites\ndaily_articles_website_1 = 20\ndaily_articles_website_2 = 10\n\n# number of days in February\nfebruary_days = 2.8 * 10\n\n# total number of articles published by each website in February\ntotal_website_1 = daily_articles_website_1 * february_days\ntotal_website_2 = daily_articles_website_2 * february_days\n\n# total number of articles published by both websites in February\ntotal_articles = total_website_1 + total_website_2\n\nprint(total_articles)\n```\n\nYou can run above python code to get the total number of articles by both websites in February."
