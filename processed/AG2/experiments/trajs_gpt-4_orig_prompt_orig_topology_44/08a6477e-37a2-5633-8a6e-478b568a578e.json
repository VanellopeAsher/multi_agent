You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50.

So in total, they had 19 + 50 = 69 bandages.\n- On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day.\n- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. So they added 50 * 2 = 100 bandages and used 0.5 * 50 = 25 bandages.\n- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n```python\n# Initial number of bandages plus one bulk pack\ninitial_bandages = 19 \nbulk_pack = 50\ntotal_first_day = initial_bandages + bulk_pack \n\n# Amount of bandages used on the second day\nused_second_day = 10\n\n# Total bandages at the start of the third day (subtracting what they used on the second day)\ntotal_third_day_start = total_first_day - used_second_day\n\n# Total bandages after ordering two bulk packs and using half on the third day\ntotal_third_day_end = total_third_day_start + 2*bulk_pack - 0.5*bulk_pack\n\n# Therefore, the equation we form for the total bandages at the end of the third day is\n# total_third_day_end = 78, we can solve this equation to find the amount of bandages used on the first day\n\n```\nLet's solve this equation.\n"
