You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 100 miles a week.

This can be done by adding the hours he runs on the first day to half the amount he runs on the following two days. Then, we can calculate his speed, which is his distance divided by his time.\n\nLet's solve this problem with Python code directly.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total distance John runs\ntotal_distance = 100  # in miles\n\n# total time John spends running\ntime_first_day = 10  # in hours\ntime_other_days = time_first_day / 2  # in hours\ntotal_time = time_first_day + 2 * time_other_days  # in hours\n\n# calculate his speed\nspeed = total_distance / total_time  # in miles per hour\n\nprint(speed)\n```"
