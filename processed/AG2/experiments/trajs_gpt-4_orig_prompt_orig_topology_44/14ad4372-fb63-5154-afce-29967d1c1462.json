She charges $15.00 per student for each class. Additionally, she offers a free 5-minute warm-up session before each class, which doesn't affect her earnings. How much money does she make in 1 week?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday.

      "content": "Key idea: \nJudy teaches different number of classes on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We know that each class has 15 students and each student pays $15 per class. So, we can calculate daily earnings for Judy by multiplying the number of classes with the number of students and the fee per class. Then, we can calculate total weekly earnings by adding her earnings from all the 7 days of the week.\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate Judy's weekly earnings.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Number of classes Judy teaches from Monday to Friday = 5\nclasses_Mon_Fri = 5\n\n# Number of classes Judy teaches on Saturday = 8\nclasses_Sat = 8\n\n# Number of students per class = 15\nstudents_per_class = 15\n\n# Fee per student per class = $15\nfee_per_student = 15\n\n# Calculate Judy's earnings\nearnings_Mon_Fri = classes_Mon_Fri * students_per_class * fee_per_student\nearnings_Sat = classes_Sat * students_per_class * fee_per_student\nearnings_Sun = 0 # Judy doesn't teach on Sunday\n\n# Sum up Judy's earnings for the week\ntotal_earnings = 5 * earnings_Mon_Fri + earnings_Sat + earnings_Sun\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\nWrap the final result in the \\boxed{} command."
