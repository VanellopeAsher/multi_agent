  "problem": "Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife. The first venue charges a flat fee of $2000, regardless of how many guests attend. While the second charges, $250 per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $50 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We need to find the number of people (let's call it n), for which these two costs will be equal. To find that, we can just set up this equation:\n\n2000 + 50*n = 250n\n\nThen we solve for n.\n\nThis type of problem can be solved with Python code directly.\n\nLet's do that.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# set up the equation\nequation = Eq(2000 + 50*n, 250*n)\n\n# solve for n\nsolution = solve(equation, n)\n\nprint(solution[0])\n```"
