However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, 40 people really attended the concert. What was the audience size according to Courtney?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number.

Therefore, to find Courtney's count, we can take the actual count reported by Kelly and calculate what is 120% of that.\n\nLet's calculate that using Python:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# The actual number of people in the concert\npeople_kelly = 40\n\n# Courtney overestimated this by 20 %\npeople_courtney = sympy.Rational(120, 100) * people_kelly\nprint(people_courtney)\n```"
