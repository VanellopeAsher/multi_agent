  "problem": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. Since one actor can't come, Sean still has to memorize 15 lines in the second scene. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.

The steps are as follows:\n1. Calculate the total number of lines in the first and second scene.\n2. Calculate Sean's lines in each scene.\n3. Add up all Sean's lines to get the total lines he has to memorize.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the number of lines in the song\nsong_lines = 54\n\n# calculate the total lines in the first scene\nfirst_scene_lines = 2 * song_lines\n\n# calculate Sean's lines in the first scene\nsean_first_scene_lines = first_scene_lines / 3\n\n# calculate the total lines in the second scene\nsecond_scene_lines = song_lines + 6\n\n# calculate Sean's lines in the second scene\nsean_second_scene_lines = second_scene_lines * 4 / 5\n\n# Sean have to memorize 15 lines in the second scene because an actor can't come\nsean_second_scene_lines += 15\n\n# Sean's total lines is the sum of his lines in the song, 1st and 2nd scene\ntotal_lines = song_lines + sean_first_scene_lines + sean_second_scene_lines\n\nprint(total_lines)\n```"
