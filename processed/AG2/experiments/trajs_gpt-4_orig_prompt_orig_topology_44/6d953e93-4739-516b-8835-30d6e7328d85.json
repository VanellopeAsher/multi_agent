  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

      "content": "The key to solving this problem involves setting up and solving an equation based on the given conditions.\n\nWe know that the mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. From the problem, we know that on Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires and on Friday, he only repaired car tires. The earnings of Thursday were 40 dollars more than the earnings of Friday.\n\nIf we denote the number of car tires repaired on Friday as x, we can express the problem mathematically as follows:\n\n60 * 6 (for truck tires on Thursday) + 40 * 4 (for car tires on Thursday) = 40 * x (for car tires on Friday) + 40 (additional earnings on Thursday compared to Friday)\n\nWe can then solve this equation for x, which gives the number of car tires that were repaired on Friday.\n\nLet's implement this solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# set up the equation\nequation = Eq(60 * 6 + 40 * 4, 40 * x + 40)\n\n# solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n# output the solution\nprint(\"The mechanic repairs\", solution[0], \"car tires on Friday.\")\n```\n\nThe mathematical solution will give us the number of car tires repaired on Friday."
