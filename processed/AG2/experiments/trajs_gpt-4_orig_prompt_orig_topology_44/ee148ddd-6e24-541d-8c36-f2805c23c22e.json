  "problem": "While on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. In between these activities, he took 5 breaks of 15 minutes each to rest and hydrate, and he also spent 1 hour having lunch. However, these breaks and lunch time do not count towards the total time he spent on activities. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "The key to solve this problem is to understand that John's sightseeing, boating, swimming and watching shows time are a part of the total 100% time he spent. We need to first compute the total amount of time based on his activities and their proportions, then we can calculate the time he spent sightseeing.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate total time spent on boating, swimming and watching shows, convert all to minutes for more precision.\n2. These activities account for 30% of the total time that John spent.\n   Therefore, the total time can be calculated as total_activity_time / 0.3.\n3. The sightseeing took up 40% of the total time.\n   Therefore, the sightseeing time can be calculated as total_time * 0.4.\n4. Convert the calculated time back into hours for the final answer.\n\nLet's implement these steps with Python."
