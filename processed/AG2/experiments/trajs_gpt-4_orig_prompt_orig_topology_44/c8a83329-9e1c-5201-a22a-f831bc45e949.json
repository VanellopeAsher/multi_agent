You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends.

Add the number of pre-made Valentine's cards her dad brought her. We do not know the exact number yet, so let's call it x.\n3. Subtract the number of cards she passed out to her classmates and her family, which is 24+5=29.\n4. Add the number of cards she received from family and friends, which is 17.\n\nSo the total number of cards that Erica now has can be found using the following calculation:\n\n20 + x - 29 + 17\n\nPlease provide the number of cards in each box of pre-made Valentine's that Erica's dad brought her, so that we can compute the exact number of cards that Erica now has."
