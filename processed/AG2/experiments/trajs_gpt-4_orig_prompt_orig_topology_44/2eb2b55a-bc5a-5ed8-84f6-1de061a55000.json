  "problem": "At a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack. On the initial day, the medical staff utilized 38 bandages and procured one large pack of bandages. The following day, they used ten bandages less than the previous day. On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages and only expended half a pack. They had 78 bandages remaining at the conclusion of the third day. Can you determine the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack.

We can solve this equation to find x."
