You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 150 grams and has 4 grams of protein.

      "content": "Key idea: To calculate how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to find the protein content in 300 grams of mushrooms. Since we know that 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein in 300 grams with Python code directly, using simple proportionality. After finding the protein content in 300 grams of mushrooms every day, we multiply by 7 to find the total protein content per week.\n\nHere is the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# define the weight of mushrooms John eats per day\nweight_per_day = 300  # in grams\n# define the weight of mushrooms John eats per week\nweight_per_week = weight_per_day * 7  # in grams\n\n# define the protein content in 150 grams of mushrooms\nprotein_in_150g = 4  # in grams\n\n# calculate the protein content in 300 grams of mushrooms \nprotein_in_300g = weight_per_day / 150 * protein_in_150g  # in grams\n\n# calculate the total protein content per week\nprotein_per_week = weight_per_week / 150 * protein_in_150g  # in grams\n\nprint(protein_per_week)\n```\n\nThe above Python code calculates the total grams of protein John gets per week if he eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day."
