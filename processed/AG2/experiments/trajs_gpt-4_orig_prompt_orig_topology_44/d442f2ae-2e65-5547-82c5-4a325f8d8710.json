You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn goes to the market with $10,000 in his pocket.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is simply addition and multiplication.\n\nSince John bought 3 goats each costing $500. The sum total for the goats would be $500 x 3\nSimilarly, the 2 cows cost him $1500 each. So, the total cost for the cows would be $1500 x 2\nThe total cost of John's shopping can be calculated by summing up the cost of the goats and the cows.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python\n\n```python\n# cost of each goat\ngoat_price = 500\n# number of goats bought\ngoats_bought = 3\n# total cost for goats\ntotal_goat_price = goat_price * goats_bought\n\n# cost of each cow\ncow_price = 1500\n# number of cows bought\ncows_bought = 2\n# total cost for cows\ntotal_cow_price = cow_price * cows_bought\n\n# total shopping cost\ntotal_shopping_cost = total_goat_price + total_cow_price\n\nprint(total_shopping_cost)\n```"
