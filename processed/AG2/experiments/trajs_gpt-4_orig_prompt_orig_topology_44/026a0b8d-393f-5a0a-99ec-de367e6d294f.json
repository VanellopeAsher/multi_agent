She has bought some packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. A packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30. If she used $3200 to buy the seeds, how many packets of tomato seeds did she buy?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

The cost of all the tomato seed packets she bought would be `40 * T`.\n\nThe number of packets of celery seeds Mrs. Rylan bought is 80, so the cost of all the celery seed packets she bought is `30 * 80`.\n\nGiven that the total cost of all the seeds she bought is $3200, we can derive this equation: `40 * T + 30 * 80 = 3200`.\n\nWe can solve this equation to find `T`.\n\nLet's move on to the Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nT = symbols('T')\n\n# define the equation\nequation = Eq(40 * T + 30 * 80, 3200)\n\n# solve the equation\nT_value = solve(equation, T)\nprint(T_value)\n```"
