You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTara bought several packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each.

      "content": "We can solve this problem using algebra.\n\nLet's denote the number of bags Tara bought as 'b'. Since the bags were bought in packs of 5, the number of bags is a multiple of 5.\n\nKey Idea: Because Tara bought the bags for $4 each and sold them for $8 each, each bag made her a profit of $8 - $4 = $4. \n\nSo, if we multiply the number of bags by the profit per bag, we will get the total profit.\n\nThus, we can form the equation: 4b = $160, and then solve this equation for 'b'.\n\nThis quantity 'b' will be the total number of bags. To find the number of packs, we will have to divide 'b' by 5, since each pack contains 5 bags. \n\nLet's calculate this now."
