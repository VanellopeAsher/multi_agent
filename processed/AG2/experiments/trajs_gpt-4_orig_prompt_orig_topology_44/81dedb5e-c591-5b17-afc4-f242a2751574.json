You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarty has a certain length of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

This can be solved directly with Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol\nlength_of_ribbon = symbols('x')\n\n# Assume the total length of the ribbon is 'x'\n# After cutting into 4 parts, each part is x/4\n# Then, each part is divided into 5, so each final cut is (x/4)/5\n\neach_cut = (length_of_ribbon/4)/5\n\n# print the result\nprint(each_cut)\n```\nIn the above calculation, 'x' stands for the total length of the ribbon. By substituting the specific length into 'x', we can get the length of each final cut."
