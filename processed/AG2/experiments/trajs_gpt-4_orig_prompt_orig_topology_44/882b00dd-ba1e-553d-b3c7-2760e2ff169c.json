On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. After two months of employment, Sally's salary was $0.5 more per hour than brfore. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhen Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.

      "content": "First, we need to calculate how much Billy and Sally each earn for 20 hours of work. Billy works at an hourly rate that increases twice over the course of a year: $10 + $0.5 + $1 = $11.5 per hour. So for 20 hours, Billy earns $11.5 * 20 = $230.\n\nSally works at an hourly rate that was initially $0.5 higher than Billy's original rate, so $10 + $0.5 = $10.5 per hour. After two months, her rate increases by $0.5 to $11.0 per hour. So for 20 hours, Sally earns $11.0 * 20 = $220.\n\nBilly earns $10 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.\n\nNow let's write it in Python code. Notice that we use sympy to show the output in fraction form.\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Billy's hourly rate\nb_rate = 10 + 0.5 + 1\n\n# Sally's hourly rate\ns_rate = 10 + 0.5 + 0.5\n\n# Calculate earnings\nb_earnings = b_rate * 20\ns_earnings = s_rate * 20\n\ndiff = b_earnings - s_earnings\nprint(diff)\n```\nAfter running this program, you should get the result as 10. So the answer is $\\boxed{10}$."
