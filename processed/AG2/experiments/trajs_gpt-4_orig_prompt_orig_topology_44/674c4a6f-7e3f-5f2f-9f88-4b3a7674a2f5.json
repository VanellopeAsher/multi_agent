You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nTo have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 85 or higher in his math class.

The formula to calculate the average is:\n```\naverage = (sum_of_the_values) / (number_of_values)\n```\n\nSo, first we sum up all the test scores. Then we can divide the total by the number of test scores (which is 5 in this case) to find the average, or his current math grade.\n\nLet's use Python to calculate this.\n\n```python\n# Define the test scores\ntest_scores = [70, 95, 88, 90, 78]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the test scores\ntotal_scores = sum(test_scores)\n\n# Calculate the average\naverage_grade = total_scores / len(test_scores)\n\n# Print the average grade\nprint(average_grade)\n```"
