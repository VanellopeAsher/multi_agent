You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nAli has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm.

We will subtract this amount from the total amount Ali has to find out how much he has. We will multiply this amount by 3/5 to find out how much Ali uses to buy dinner. Subtracting this amount from the remaing amount will give us how much Ali has left after buying dinner.\n\nSo, firstly we sum up all the amount Ali has:\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# total money of $10 bills\nmoney_10 = 10 * 4\n\n# total money of $20 bills\nmoney_20 = 20 * 6\n\n# total money that Ali initially has\ninitial_money = money_10 + money_20\n\nprint(initial_money)\n```"
