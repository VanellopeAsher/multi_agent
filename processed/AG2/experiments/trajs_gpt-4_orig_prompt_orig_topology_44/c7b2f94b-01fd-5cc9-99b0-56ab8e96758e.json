  "problem": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nWhile Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her.

It is given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees.\n\nThen, we know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne does. As she doesn't take any from the average trees, the number of apples she gets from the shortest trees is the remaining from the total number of apples they both gathered, which is 500.\n\nWith the number of apples that Joanne's sister gets from the shortest trees, we then calculate how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne did from the shortest trees.\n\nTo solve this, we will\n- calculate the number of apples Joanne gathered from each type of tree\n- calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from each type of tree\n- calculate the times Joanne's sister gathered as many apples as Joanne did from the shortest trees."
