Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. She also subscribes to Netflix for $15 a month, but she has a coupon to offset that $15.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month.

After finding the minimum payment, we can then add 50% more to this amount to find out how much she actually ends up paying each month. This payment is then multiplied by 12 to find the cost in a year.\n\nNow, Let's work through it step by step. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total minimum payment for all her debts.\nStep 2: Calculate how much 50% more of the minimum payment is.\nStep 3: Add the increase from step 2 to the minimum payment from step 1. This will give us how much Jessica pays each month.\nStep 4: Multiply by 12 to find out how much Jessica pays in a year.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations in python."
