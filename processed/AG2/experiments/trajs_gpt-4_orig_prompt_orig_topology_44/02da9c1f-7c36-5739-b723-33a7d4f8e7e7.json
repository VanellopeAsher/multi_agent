You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMonica is wrapping Christmas gifts.

Let me illustrate the importance of this information with a simplified example:\n\nIf Monica has 120 inches of ribbon and she needs to wrap 12 gifts (6 for her family, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers), we can calculate the amount of ribbon per gift by dividing the total length of ribbon by the number of gifts:\n\n```python\ntotal_ribbon = 120  # Total length of ribbon in inches\ntotal_gifts = 12  # Number of gifts\n\nribbon_per_gift = total_ribbon / total_gifts\n\nprint(ribbon_per_gift)\n```\n\nExecuting this Python code would give us the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift, if she has 120 inches of ribbon. But without the actual total length of ribbon or the length per bow, we cannot solve your original problem."
