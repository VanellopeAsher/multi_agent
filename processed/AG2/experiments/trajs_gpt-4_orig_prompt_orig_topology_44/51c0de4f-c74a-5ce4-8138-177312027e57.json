His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him some money.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

We already know that his neighbours and the online fund contributed $500 and $1500 respectively. We need to find out how much his friend gave him.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Calculate how much the neighbours and the online fund have collectively donated.\n2. Consider this amount and the friend's donation as the total collection that needs to be three times less than the lawyer's contribution.\n3. So, we can write an equation for the lawyer's contribution: $6600 = 3 * (neighbours donation + online fund donation + friend's donation).\n4. Using the equation, we can compute the friend's donation.\n\nLet's carry out these steps."
