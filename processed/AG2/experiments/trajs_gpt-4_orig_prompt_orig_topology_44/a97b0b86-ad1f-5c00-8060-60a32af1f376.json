You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3.5 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

We can then set up an equation that represents the total cost and solve for the variable representing the boxes of pizza.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- p as the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. We don't know p yet.\n\nWe can create an equation to represent the total cost of Marie's order:\n\n$12 (for the chicken) + 5 * $3.50 (for the milk) + 4 * $1.50 (for the apples) + p * $8.50 (for the pizza) = $52.50\n\nWe can then simplify and solve this equation for p (the number of pizza boxes). Let's do that in Python using the sympy package."
