You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nThe amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

On the third day, the total volume of water passing through the point equals 14000 gallons. The increase in the third day is the difference between the total amount of water on the third day and the sum of the water volumes on the first two days.\n\nWe can solve this directly using Python:\n\n```python\n# Defining the amount of water on the first and second days\nfirst_day = 4000\nsecond_day = 2 * first_day\n\n# Total amount of water on the third day\ntotal_third_day = 14000\n\n# Calculating the increase on the third day\nincrease_third_day = total_third_day - (first_day + second_day)\n\nprint(\"The increase in the amount of water on the third day is:\", increase_third_day, \"gallons\")\n```"
