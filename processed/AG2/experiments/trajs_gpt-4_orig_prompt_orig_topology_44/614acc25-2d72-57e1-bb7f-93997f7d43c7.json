So the amount of animals killed last night is 10 + c, today it's w + c - 3. So, we have the following two equations:\n\n1. w = 3*(c - 3) (from \"Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night\")\n2. total = (10 + c) + (w + c - 3) (total amount of animals Rick killed over these two days)\n\nThe task is to find the total.
