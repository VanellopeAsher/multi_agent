You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.

      "content": "The key to solve this problem is to calculate Stephen's debt to his sister and how it changes each month.\n\nTo solve this problem in general, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate Stephen's initial debt, which is $300.\n2. For each of the first 11 months, remove $25 from the debt and add 2% interest to the new debt.\n3. On the 12th month, add 2% interest again, and that's the amount Stephen needs to pay back.\n\nLet's now write the Python code to calculate the exact amount for the 12th month using the sympy package to keep everything in fractions:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational, N\n\n# initial debt\ndebt = 300\n\n# for the first 11 months, pay $25 per month and add 2% interest\nfor month in range(11):\n    debt = debt - 25\n    debt = debt * Rational(102, 100)\n\n# on the 12th month, pay back the remaining amount after adding 2% interest\ndebt = debt * Rational(102, 100)\n\n# print the result\nprint(debt)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you will get the 12th month payment amount that Stephen needs to make to his sister, ignoring his coin purchases. Please run the Python code and provide the result."
