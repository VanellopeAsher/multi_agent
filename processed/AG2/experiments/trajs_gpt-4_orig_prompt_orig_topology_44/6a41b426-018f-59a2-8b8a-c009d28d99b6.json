You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?"

It appears that it's stated that John runs 3 days a week but it sounds like he might actually run 5 days a week. He runs half as much on the other two days, implying an additional 2 days of running on top of the 3 initially mentioned. Could you confirm the total number of days John is running?"

      "content": "Okay, considering that John runs five days a week, with 3 of those days being longer runs and 2 days being half as long as the other days, we can proceed to solve the problem.\n\nThe key idea here is to establish an equation system that describes John's running schedule, and then solve the equations.\nFirst, we denote that the distance John runs each of the three days is x miles, and the distance he runs each of the remaining two days is 0.5x miles.\nSo we have the following equation based on the given information:\n\n3x + 2*0.5x = 60\n\nWe can use Python to solve this equation to find the value of x (the distance John runs each of the three days). The result will gives the distance John runs each day."
