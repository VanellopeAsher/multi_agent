You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nIf Sam and Harry have 200 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 80 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?"

      "content": "The key idea to this problem is setting up an algebraic equation expressing the problem and then solving for it. \n\nLet's denote H as the amount of fence Harry gets and S as the amount of fence Sam gets. The problem states that Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam so we can express Harry's amount as S+80. The problem also states that they have a total of 200 feet of fence, so the total equation would be H + S = 200. Substituting H with S+80 we get (S + 80) + S = 200. \n\nSolving this equation will give us the amount of fence left for Sam.\n\nLet's solve this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nS, H = symbols('S H')\n\n# equation representing the total amount of fence\ntotal_equation = Eq(H + S, 200)\n\n# equation representing the amount Harry gets\nharry_equation = Eq(H, S + 80)\n\n# substitute Harry's amount in the total equation\nequation_sub = total_equation.subs(H, S + 80)\n\n# solve for S\nsam_feet = solve(equation_sub, S)[0]\n\nprint(sam_feet)\n```"
