You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nEvery packet of graham crackers can be used to create the base for 8 big smores.

      "content": "Key Idea: The problem describes two types of people: children and adults. Each child desires 2 smores and each adult desires 1 smore. We can get the total number of smores by multiplying the number of people by the smores they desire. Then divide this sum by the total number of smores that can be made from one box to find out how many boxes are needed. It's key to remember that if there's any remainder, we have to account for an additional box since we can't purchase part of a box.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# quantity of smores desired by different groups of people\nchildren_desired_smores = 9*2\nadults_desired_smores = 6*1\n\n# total number of smores that can be gotten from one box\nsmores_per_box = 8*3\n\n# total number of smores required\ntotal_smores = children_desired_smores + adults_desired_smores\n\n# number of boxes needed\nboxes_needed = math.ceil(total_smores / smores_per_box)\n\nprint(boxes_needed)\n```"
