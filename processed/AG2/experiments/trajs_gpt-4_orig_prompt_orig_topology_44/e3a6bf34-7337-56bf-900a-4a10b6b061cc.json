You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.

Since the cost of green ties are 70% more than yellow ties, we can calculate the cost of green ties.\n3. Find out the total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on yellow ties and green ties.\n\nLet's solve each step one by one. \n\n1. Calculate how many yellow ties John bought. \n   If each yellow tie cost $30 and he spent $300 on yellow ties, the number of yellow ties he bought is $300 / $30 = 10 ties.\n\n2. Compute the cost of green ties.\n   As green ties cost 70% more than yellow ties, cost of each green tie = $30 + 70% of $30.\n\n3. Find the total cost of ties he bought.\n   Therefore, the total cost for the ties is amount spent on yellow ties + amount spent on green ties.\n\nLet's put this in code."
