If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items, and he also decides to buy a pack of cookies for 2 dollars and a bottle of water for 1 dollar, how much did everything cost?

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn goes shopping and buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to identify which items are nonfood items, calculate the tax for every nonfood item and then sum the costs of all items, including taxes. We observe that milk, eggs, cookies and a bottle of water are food items, while light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are nonfood items.\n\nWe will use Python to calculate the total cost. The cost of nonfood items will be multiplied by 110% to include the tax, while the cost of food items will be added directly.\n\nLet's write the Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the costs of all items\nmilk = 2\neggs = 3\nlight_bulbs = 3\ncups = 3\nroach_traps = 4\ncookies = 2\nwater = 1\n\n# Calculate the tax for nonfood items\ntotal_cost_nonfood = (light_bulbs + cups + roach_traps) * 1.1\n\n# Calculate the total cost of food items\ntotal_cost_food = milk + eggs + cookies + water\n\n# The total cost is the sum of the total cost of food items and total cost of nonfood items\ntotal_cost = total_cost_nonfood + total_cost_food\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you will get the total cost.\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance."
