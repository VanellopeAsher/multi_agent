This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.

      "content": "This problem can be solved using the proportion. \n\nFirst, we can sum up the time John spent on boating, swimming and watching shows. We know that this was 30% of the total time, so we can write the equation in the form \"sum of time on activities = 0.3 * total time\". \n\nThen we know John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. By solving the equation above, we can get the total time. From there, we can calculate how much time did he spend sightseeing.\n\nThis problem can be solved directly using Python code."
