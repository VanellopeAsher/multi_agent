You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nPaisley, Reggie, and Lynn went for a run.

Let's denote the distance that Lynn ran as x (in miles). \n\nAccording to the problem, we know that Reggie ran a distance that was five times the distance that Paisley ran and also 3 miles more than what Lynn ran. We can write these relationships as equations and solve for x.\n\n1) Reggie ran a distance = 5*Paisley's distance\n2) Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3\n\nBy substituting Reggie's distance from equation 1 into equation 2, we will be able to solve for Lynn's distance.\n\nSo, we have the equations as follows:\n1) Reggie = 5 * Paisley\n2) Reggie = Lynn + 3\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this. We will use sympy solve function for the calculations."
