You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and a half as much the other two days he runs. He rests for 2 hours after each run. How fast does he run?"

      "content": "We can solve this problem using simple algebra.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the total amount of time John spends running. We know that he runs 3 hours the first day, and half as much the other two days. This means he runs 1.5 hours the other two days. \n\nSo, every week, John spends 3 (first day) + 2 * 1.5 (second and third day) = 6 hours running in total.\n\nWe know that speed is equal to distance divided by time. We can use this formula to find out how fast John runs. The distance is 60 miles (the total distance he runs per week) and the time is 6 hours (the total time he spends running in a week).\n\nSo let's calculate John's speed using Python. We can use the sympy package to ensure the result remains in fractions form. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# defining the variables\ndistance = 60 # in miles\ntime = 6 # in hours\n\n# calculate speed\nspeed = distance / time\n\nprint(speed)\n```\n\nYou can run this code to get the solution."
