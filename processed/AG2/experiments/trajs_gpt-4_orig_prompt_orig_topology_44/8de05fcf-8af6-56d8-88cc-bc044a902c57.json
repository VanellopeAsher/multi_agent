You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "The key idea here is to set up equations based on the problem statement and then solve for the unknowns.\n\n1. According to the problem, each blog article takes Meredith 4 hours to write. So the total hours she spent writing is equal to the number of articles times 4.\n\nCase 3: We have two unknowns here, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday and Wednesday. We know that she wrote 5 articles on Monday, 2/5 more articles on Tuesday than Monday, and an unknown number on Wednesday. \n\nLet's denote:\n- number of articles written on Tuesday as T\n- number of articles written on Wednesday as W\n\nFrom the problem we have the following equations:\n\n1. T = 5 + 2/5 * 5 (she wrote 2/5 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday)\n\n2. (5 + T + W) * 4 = 104 (total writing hours for three days)\n\nWe can solve the first equation to find out the value of T (number of articles she wrote on Tuesday).\n\nAfter we get T, we could insert it in the second equation to solve for W (number of articles she wrote on Wednesday).\n\nThen, finally we can find out how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday by dividing W by T.\n\nLet's calculate these step by step. Attached is the Python code for the above equation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nT, W = symbols('T W')\n\n# calculate T\neq1 = Eq(T, 5 + 2/5 * 5)\nT_value = solve(eq1)[0]\nprint('The number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:', T_value)\n\n# insert T in eq2 to calculate W\neq2 = Eq((5+T_value+W)*4, 104)\nW_value = solve(eq2)[0]\nprint('The number of articles she wrote on Wednesday:', W_value)\n\n# calculate the times she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday\ntimes = W_value / T_value\nprint('How many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday:', times)\n```\n\nAfter running this Python code, we will get the answers we are looking for."
