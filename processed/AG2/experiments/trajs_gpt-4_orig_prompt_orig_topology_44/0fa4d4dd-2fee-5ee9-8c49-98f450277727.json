Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 10 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $10 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $100 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes.

We also know she had $100 saved already.\n\nSara wants to buy a jacket for $120 and two pairs of shoes, each costing $100, so the total amount she needs is $120 + 2*$100.\n\nWe can calculate the difference between the amount Sara needs and what she already has earned from babysitting and her previous savings. \n\nFinally, since Sara earns $10 each time she mows the lawn, we can divide the remaining amount by 10 to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn.\n\nWe can solve this using Python code directly:\n\n```python\nbabysitting_earnings = 5 * 10\nsavings = 100\n\njacket_cost = 120\nshoe_cost = 100\n\ntotal_needed = jacket_cost + 2 * shoe_cost\n\nremaining_amount = total_needed - (babysitting_earnings + savings)\n\nlawn_mowing_times = remaining_amount / 10\n\nprint(lawn_mowing_times)\n```"
