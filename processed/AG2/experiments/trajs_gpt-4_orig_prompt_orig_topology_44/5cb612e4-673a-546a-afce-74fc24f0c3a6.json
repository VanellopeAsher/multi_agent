  "problem": "A trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. Each bag of wheat weighs 60 pounds. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag.

      "content": "Key Idea:\nTotal profit is calculated by subtracting total expenses from total earnings. To find the number of bags that the trader sold, we need to find the total earnings and total expenses first.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Total earnings is calculated as the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold.\n2. The total expense includes the purchase expense and the transport expense. The purchase expense is calculated as the buying price per bag multiplied by the number of bags bought. The transport expense is calculated as the transport cost per bag multiplied by the number of bags transported.\n3. The total profit is given by the total earnings minus the total expenses. Given the profit, we can calculate the number of bags sold.\n\nWe can use Python to solve the equations formed in the above steps and find out the number of bags sold. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# define the number of bags as a variable\nn = symbols('n')\n\n# given values\nbuying_rate = 20  # per bag\nselling_rate = 30  # per bag\ntransport_cost = 2  # per bag\nprofit = 400\n\n# total earnings = selling rate * number of bags\nearnings = selling_rate * n\n\n# total expenses = (buying rate + transport cost) * number of bags\nexpenses = (buying_rate + transport_cost) * n\n\n# profit = earnings - expenses\n# setting up the equation for the profit and solving it for 'n'\nequation = Eq(earnings - expenses, profit)\nnum_bags = solve(equation, n)[0]\n\nprint(num_bags)\n```\n\nThe above code will output the number of bags that the trader sold."
