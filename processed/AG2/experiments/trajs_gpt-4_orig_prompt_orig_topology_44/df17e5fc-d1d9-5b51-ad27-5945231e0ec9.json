You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it.

Therefore, the other half must be the combined red, white, and purple colors, which is equally divided among them. We can use these relations to calculate the quantity of red paint used.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Total amount of paint is 12 pints\ntotal_paint = 12\n\n# Half the mural is yellow\nyellow_paint = total_paint / 2\n\n# Remaining amount of paint is divided equally among red, white, and purple\nremaining_paint_for_three_colors = total_paint - yellow_paint\n\n# Therefore, each of red, white, and purple colors is used equally from remaining_paint_for_three_colors\nred_paint = remaining_paint_for_three_colors / 3\n\nprint(\"Amount of red paint used: \", red_paint)\n```"
