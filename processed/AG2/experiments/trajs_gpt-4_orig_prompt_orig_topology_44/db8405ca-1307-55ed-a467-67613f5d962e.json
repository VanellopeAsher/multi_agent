You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohn is a carpenter.

We need to multiply the number of each object by their respective price, and then add the two resulting values to get the total amount Ali has to pay John.\n\n```python\n# Number of tables, price of each table\nnum_tables, price_per_table = 40, 200\n\n# Number of roof frames, price of each frame\nnum_frames, price_per_frame = 20, 100\n\n# Calculate total\ntotal = num_tables * price_per_table + num_frames * price_per_frame\n\nprint(total)\n```\nThis Python code should correctly calculate and output the total amount Ali would have to pay John according to the quantity and price of tables and roof frames."
