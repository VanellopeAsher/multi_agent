You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th.

Determine the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.\n2. Calculate the total calorific deficit needed to lose 30 pounds.\n3. Divide the total calorific deficit by the number of days to find the daily calorific deficit. \n\nLet's start with calculating the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. In python, we can make use of the 'datetime' built-in module to achieve this. The difference of two datetime objects results in a timedelta object from which we can get the number of days.\n\nFor now, you will provide me the current year. Let's write the code for this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Please provide the current year\nyear = 2021\n\ndate1 = datetime(year, 12, 31) \ndate2 = datetime(year+1, 7, 19)\ndelta = date2 - date1\n\n# Print number of days\nprint(delta.days)\n```\n\nPlease run this code and give me the result, so we can proceed to the next steps."

Now that we know there are 200 days from December 31st to July 19th, we can proceed to calculate the total calorific deficit.\n\nThe total calorific deficit is obtained by multiplying the number of pounds Andy wants to lose (30 lbs) by the number of calories needed to burn one pound (3500 calories). \n\nWe will then divide this total by the number of days (200) to get the daily calorific deficit. \n\nHere is the Python code for this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Pounds to lose\npounds_to_lose = 30\n\n# Calories to burn one pound\ncalories_per_pound = 3500\n\n# Total calorific deficit\ntotal_caloric_deficit = pounds_to_lose * calories_per_pound\n\n# Daily calorific deficit\ndaily_caloric_deficit = total_caloric_deficit / delta.days\n\nprint(daily_caloric_deficit)\n```\n\nPlease run the code and provide the result."
