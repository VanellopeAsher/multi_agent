You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.

Then, we will subtract this total cost from the total amount paid to find out how much Marie spent on pizza boxes. Finally, we'll divide the amount spent on pizzas by the cost of one box to find out how many boxes Marie ordered. \n\n```python\n# Given figures \ncost_of_chicken_meal = 120  # in dollars\ncost_of_milk_pack = 30  # in dollars\nnumber_of_milk_packs = 5\ncost_of_apple = 1.5  # in dollars\nnumber_of_apples = 40\ntotal_paid = 900  # in dollars\ncost_of_pizza = 57  # in dollars\n\n# Calculations\ntotal_cost_of_milk = cost_of_milk_pack * number_of_milk_packs\ntotal_cost_of_apples = cost_of_apple * number_of_apples\ntotal_cost_without_pizza = cost_of_chicken_meal + total_cost_of_milk + total_cost_of_apples\n\ntotal_paid_for_pizza = total_paid - total_cost_without_pizza\nnumber_of_pizzas = total_paid_for_pizza // cost_of_pizza  # We assume there are no fraction pizzas\n\nprint(number_of_pizzas)\n```\nThis code will calculate the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered."
