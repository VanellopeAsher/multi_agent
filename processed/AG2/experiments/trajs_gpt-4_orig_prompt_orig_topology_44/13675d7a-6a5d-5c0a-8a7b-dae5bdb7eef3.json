You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nHenry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.

Therefore, the total number of wheels used is the sum of 4 times the number of cars and 2 times the number of motorcycles. The problem states that there are 276 wheels left after assembling all the toys, so to find the total number of wheels, we would add 276 to the total number of wheels used.\n\nLet's now write a Python program for this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# define the number of cars and motorcycles\ncars = 57\nmotorcycles = 73\n\n# calculation\nwheels_used = 4*cars + 2*motorcycles\ntotal_wheels = wheels_used + 276\n\n# output\nprint(total_wheels)\n```"
