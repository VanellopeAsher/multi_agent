You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJackson is planting tulips.

Once we have the total amounts, we can divide the total number of each color by the number of tulips per row to find the number of rows for each color.\n3. Finally, we add up the total number of rows.\n\nBased on this, we can solve this problem using Python. We have been told that Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. He buys 3.6 times of ten red tulips and 2.4 times of ten blue tulips.\n\nLets proceed with these steps to get the final output."
