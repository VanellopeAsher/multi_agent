You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nFor one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine a certain mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 448 mL of medicine were in 8 doses.

      "content": "The key idea to solve this problem is to construct an equation. Saanvi combines a certain mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine for each dose. The total amount of medicine in 8 doses equals 448 mL.\n\nThe equation can be written as follows: `4 * x * 8 = 448`, where x is the volume of medicine 1 she combines each time. Then we can solve the equation to find the value of x. \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\nx = sp.Symbol('x')\nequation = 4 * x * 8 - 448\nsolution = sp.solve(equation, x)\n\nprint(solution)\n```\nAfter running the code you'll get the number of mL of one medicine that Saanvi combines each time."
