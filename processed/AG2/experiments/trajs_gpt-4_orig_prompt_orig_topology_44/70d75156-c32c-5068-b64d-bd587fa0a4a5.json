We'd need to define the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought initially, as it's not provided in the problem description. \n\nJust to clarify, assuming Mrs. Harrington has initially bought x boxes of oranges, she gave 4 boxes away (each to her mom and sister), kept 1/4 of the remaining, and sold the rest. \n\nLet's move forward with this information and use the symbolic computation to figure out how to calculate for Mrs. Harrington's total boxes of oranges `x`:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# total boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought and number of oranges in each box\nx, oranges_in_box = symbols('x oranges_in_box') \n\n#  the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington gave way to her mom and her sister\nboxes_given = 2 + 2 \n\n# Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes after giving away 4\nboxes_remaining_after_giving_away = (x - boxes_given)\n\nequation = Eq(boxes_remaining_after_giving_away / 4, boxes_remaining_after_giving_away)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation)\n\n# Find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had sold, which is 3/4 of the remaining after giving away\noranges_sold = solution[0] * oranges_in_box * 3 / 4\n\nprint(\"Mrs. Harrington sold\",oranges_sold, \"oranges.\")\n```\nWith this logic, the formula is able to give us how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, provided we know the initial number of boxes `x`."

      "content": "It appears that the initial total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington bought (x) is still undefined. Moreover, the question does not specify this value. My apologies for any confusion caused by this oversight.\n\nConsidering this, without the specific value of how many boxes Mrs. Harrington originally bought, it's not possible to obtain an absolute number of oranges she sold. Instead, we can express the number of oranges sold in terms of `oranges_in_box`. \n\nHowever, based on the calculation, we can interpret that Mrs. Harrington sold three times the number of oranges in one box, after giving away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 to her sister, and keeping 1/4 of the rest for herself.\n\nSo the formula `3*oranges_in_box` giving the number of the oranges Mrs. Harrington sold holds true for each box of oranges if the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington originally bought is the solution to the equation. \n\nIn conclusion, with given conditions and using the provided formula, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is three times the number of oranges in one box.\n\n$\\boxed{3 \\times \\text{{oranges\\_in\\_box}}}$"
