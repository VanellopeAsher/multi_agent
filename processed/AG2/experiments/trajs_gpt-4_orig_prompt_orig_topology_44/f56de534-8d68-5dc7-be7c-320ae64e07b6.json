You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nProblem:\nJohnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.

Determine the total pieces in each lego set. For the first lego set, it has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3*500 pieces. The third set has 1/4 the number of the first one, so it has 1/4*500 pieces. The last set has 125 more pieces than the first one, so it has 500 + 125 pieces.\n2. Add up the total pieces from each lego set.\n\nLet's write a Python program to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Python code to determine the total lego pieces \n\n#Given values\nset1_pieces = 500\n\n#Determine the number of pieces in other sets based on the conditions\nset2_pieces = 3 * set1_pieces\nset3_pieces = 1/4 * set1_pieces\nset4_pieces = set1_pieces + 125\n\n#Compute total lego pieces\ntotal_pieces = set1_pieces + set2_pieces + set3_pieces + set4_pieces\n\n#Display the total pieces\nprint(total_pieces)\n```"
