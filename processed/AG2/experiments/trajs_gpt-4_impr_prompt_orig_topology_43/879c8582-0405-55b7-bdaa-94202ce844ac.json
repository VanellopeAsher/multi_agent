Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?"

After that, let's subtract 50 cards that she keeps. Then we can divide by ten to find out the number of students, because each student got ten cards. Let's do these calculations. \n\n```python\n# number of cards in Miss Maria's full collection (basketball, baseball, and soccer)\ntotal_cards = 6*25 + 5*40 + 30\n\n# number of cards she gives to her students\ncards_for_students = total_cards - 50\n\n# number of students\nnum_students = cards_for_students // 10\n\nprint(num_students)\n```"

Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards (6 decks * 25 cards each), 200 baseball cards (5 boxes * 40 cards each) and a special collection of 30 soccer cards. The total number of sports cards in her collection is 380 cards (150 + 200 + 30).\n2. She keeps 50 cards, so she gives away 330 cards (380 - 50).\n3. Since each student receives 10 cards, the class should consist of 33 students (330 / 10).\n\nTherefore, all calculations seems to be accurate. Thus, the final answer is that Miss Maria has 33 students. \n\nBoxed answer:\n$\\boxed{33}$."
