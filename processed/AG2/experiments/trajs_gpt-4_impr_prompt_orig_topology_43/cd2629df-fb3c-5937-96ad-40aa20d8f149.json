Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nStephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To make things more interesting, he decided to pay her back in a unique way. For 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month, even though he also spends $50 on his hobby of collecting rare coins each month.

      "content": "Let's adopt the 'Step-by-Step Process' strategy to handle this problem.\n\nTo arrive at the answer, follow these broad steps:\n\nI. Calculate the Total amount Stephen owed his sister, which is comprised of the initial amount borrowed and the interest added.\n\nII. Compute the amount Stephen has already paid back in 11 months.\n\nIII. Subtract the amount paid from the Total amount owed to find out the amount Stephen has to pay back in the 12th month.\n\nLet's tackle each one.\n\nI. Total Amount Owed:\nThe interest is calculated as (2% of $300) = $300 * 2/100.\nNext, we add this amount to the borrowed sum to get the total amount owed.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\noc = 300  # original cash owed \nintr = 2  # interest in %\n\ntotal = oc + (oc * intr / 100)  # total amount of money owed\n```\n\nII. The Amount Stephen has already paid in the 11 months\nAs per the scenario, Stephen pays $25 each month for 11 months.\n```python\npm = 25  # payment per month\nmonths = 11  # number of months\n\npaid = pm * months  # total money paid so far\n```\n\nIII. Amount Stephen has to pay back in the 12th month. This is calculated as total due - money already paid.\n```python\nto_pay = total - paid  # total amount of money to pay\n```\n\nI will compute the above in the next step. Awaiting your approval."

Total Amount Owed:\nTo work out the total amount Stephen owed his sister, we first computed the 2% interest on the original loan amount ($300) which gave us $6. Adding this to the initial sum resulted in $306, which matches our calculated output.\n\nII. The Amount Stephen has already paid in 11 months:\nStephen decided to pay his sister $25 per month for 11 months, equaling to $275. This matches with our calculated result for the total amount paid so far.\n\nIII. Amount Stephen has to pay back in the 12th month: \nItâ€™s calculated by subtracting the money already paid from the total due. In this case, $306 (total due) - $275 (money already paid over 11 months) equals to $31. This tallies with our calculated amount to be paid in the 12th month.\n\nThese calculations affirm that our intermediary steps were correct.\n\nThus the final answer (money to be paid in 12th month excluding coin purchases) is the mathematical result, which can be denoted as $\\boxed{31}$."
