Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwenty kids went out on a school trip.

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: Direct Python Solution\n\nFirst, let's identify the key information:\n1. Total number of children: 20, equally divided into boys and girls, so there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n2. Each boy brought back 60 seashells.\n2. Each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys.\n\nOur goal is to find out how many seashells were brought by each girl.\n\nThe direct approach to this problem would be to write a Python expression that represents the total number of seashells each girl would have brought. In the expression, replace the total number of seashells each boy brought with the number of seashells each girl brought. \n\nHere is the Python code to compute the total number of seashells each girl brought:\n\n```python\n# Number of seashells each boy brought\nseashells_boy = 60\n\n# Number of seashells each girl brought\nseashells_girl = seashells_boy + 4.5 * seashells_boy\n\nprint(seashells_girl)\n```"
