Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they use on the first day?"

On the first day, they started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack (50 bandages). So, we have 19 + 50 = 69 bandages in total.\n\n2. On the second day, they used X - 10 bandages.\n\n3. On the third day, they ordered two more bulk packs (100 bandages) and used half a pack (25 bandages). \n\nSo, if they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, they must have used the following number of bandages over the interval: \n\n69 (bandages after first day order) \n- X (bandages used on the first day)\n- (X - 10) (bandages used on the second day)\n+ 100 (bandages ordered on the third day)\n- 25 (bandages used on the third day)\n= 78\n\nLet's now solve the equation for X to find out how many bandages were used on the first day."
