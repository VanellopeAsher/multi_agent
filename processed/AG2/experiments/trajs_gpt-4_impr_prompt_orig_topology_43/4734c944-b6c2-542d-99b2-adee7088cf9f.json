Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week.

How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?"

      "content": "The first step is to calculate how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount throughout one week which has seven days:\n\n```python\ntotal_money = 70\ndays_in_week = 7\n\nspending_amount_per_day = total_money/days_in_week\n```\n\nTo find out how many wooden action figures Peter can buy, we will divide his daily spending by the cost of each wooden action figure, which is $5:\n\n```python\nwooden_figure_cost = 5\ndays_wooden_figure_bought = 4\n\nwooden_figures_bought = (spending_amount_per_day/wooden_figure_cost)*days_wooden_figure_bought\n```\n\nSimilarly, we will calculate how many plastic action figures Peter will be able to buy for the rest of the week. The cost of each plastic action figure is $2.5, and he will buy them for three days:\n\n```python\nplastic_figure_cost = 2.5\ndays_plastic_figure_bought = 3\n\nplastic_figures_bought = (spending_amount_per_day/plastic_figure_cost) * days_plastic_figure_bought\n```\n\nThen, we sum the number of wooden and plastic action figures to get the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:\n\n```python\ntotal_figures = wooden_figures_bought + plastic_figures_bought\n```\n\nFinally, because Peter cannot buy a fraction of a figure, we will have to make sure that the numbers we calculate are integers. If they're not, then they will have to be rounded down since we can't count part of an action figure. We can use Python's floor division (//) operator for that.\n\nHere's the full code that you can use in Python:\n\n```python\ntotal_money = 70\ndays_in_week = 7\nwooden_figure_cost = 5\ndays_wooden_figure_bought = 4\nplastic_figure_cost = 2.5\ndays_plastic_figure_bought = 3\n\nspending_amount_per_day = total_money // days_in_week\nwooden_figures_bought = (spending_amount_per_day // wooden_figure_cost) * days_wooden_figure_bought\nplastic_figures_bought = (spending_amount_per_day / plastic_figure_cost) * days_plastic_figure_bought\n\ntotal_figures = wooden_figures_bought + plastic_figures_bought\nprint(total_figures)\n```"
