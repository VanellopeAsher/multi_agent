Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCaroline has 4 children.  The first child is some feet tall.  The second child is two inches taller than the first child.  The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  The fourth child is 72 inches. How tall is the first child in feet?"

      "content": "This problem can be resolved by working backwards from the information given. \n\nStarting with the fourth child, here is what we know:\n\n1. Fourth child is 72 inches tall.\n2. Third child is three inches shorter than the fourth child.\n3. Second child is five inches taller than the third child.\n4. First child is two inches shorter than the second child.\n\nBy translating these conditions to equations, we can then solve for the height of the first child. Let's utilize the sympy library as it is efficient in solving such problems.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbolic variables\nfirst_child_height, second_child_height, third_child_height, fourth_child_height = sp.symbols('first_child_height second_child_height third_child_height fourth_child_height')\n\n# Define the conditions\nconditions = [\n    sp.Eq(fourth_child_height, 72),  # Information about the fourth child\n    sp.Eq(third_child_height, fourth_child_height - 3),  # Information about the third child\n    sp.Eq(second_child_height, third_child_height + 5),  # Information about the second child\n    sp.Eq(first_child_height, second_child_height - 2)  # Information about the first child\n]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = sp.solve(conditions)\n\n# Display the solution, converting inches to feet\nprint(solution[first_child_height]/12)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, the print statement will return the height of the first child in feet."

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 74 inches tall.\n2. The third child is five inches shorter than the second child, meaning the third child is 69 inches tall.\n3. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, which is 72 inches. This matches the information given in the problem statement.\n\nEverything is consistent, so the first child's height should be correct.\n\nTo format the result:\n\nConsider your final answer to be \\$boxed{6}\\$ feet."
