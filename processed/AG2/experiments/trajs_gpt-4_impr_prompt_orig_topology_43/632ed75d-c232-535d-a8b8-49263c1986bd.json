Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany.

      "content": "This problem can be solved with a direct Python solution. Here is the high-level plan:\n\n1. First, find out the number of total flights by the first aircraft. We know that the number of flights by the second aircraft, which are all to Poland, is half of the total flights made by the first aircraft. So, we will multiply the number of flights to Poland by 2.\n\n2. Then, calculate the number of flights to Greece by the first aircraft, which are three-fourths of the total flights made by the first aircraft.\n\n3. The leftover flights made by the first aircraft are evenly divided between France and Germany. So, to find out the flights to France, we subtract the number of flights to Greece from total flights, and then divide it by 2. \n\nWe can solve this through the following Python code:"

Therefore, the total number of flights made by the first aircraft is 88.\n- Then, we find out that the first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, which is 66.\n- The rest of the flights (22) are evenly divided between France and Germany, so each has 11 flights.\n- Hence, the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is indeed 11.\n\nSo, the final answer is 11 flights.\n\nThe final result is \\boxed{11} daily flights are made by the first aircraft to France."
