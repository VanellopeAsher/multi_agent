Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt a nurse station, bandages are purchased in large quantities of 50 per pack.

We want to find the number of bandages the medical staff had at the beginning of the first day (beginning_bandages).\n\nTo find this, we need to rearrange the equation as follows:\n\nbeginning_bandages = remaining_bandage + used_bandages - purchased_bandages\n\nLet's implement this in Python."

The medical staff starts with 19 bandages on the first day. They purchased 50, which gives a total of 69. After using 38, they have 31 left. On the second day, they used 10 less, leaving them with 21 bandages. They purchased 100 on the third day, leading to a total of 121. After using 25 (half of a pack), they ended up with 96 bandages. But we are given that they have 78 bandages remaining. So, there are 18 extra bandages, which means there were 18 bandages used, but not accounted for.\n\nNow, looking at the problem statement, it doesn't mention anything about any hidden usage of the bandages. Therefore, it implies that there is a mistake in our calculation.\n\nLet's solve our calculation using python to check where I made the mistake:\n```python\n# calculation verification\nused_day2_remaining = remaining_bandages - used_day2\nused_day3_remaining = used_day2_remaining - used_day3\npurchased_day1_remaining = used_day3_remaining + purchased_day1\n\npurchased_day1_remaining\n```"

On the first day, they start with 'beginning_bandages' and after purchasing they have 'beginning_bandages + purchased_day1' bandages. After usage, they have 'beginning_bandages + purchased_day1 - used_day1' left.\n\n2. On the second day, they use some bandages and they have 'beginning_bandages + purchased_day1 - used_day1 - used_day2' bandages.\n\n3. On the third day, they purchase new bandages before using them. So they have 'beginning_bandages + purchased_day1 - used_day1 - used_day2 + purchased_day3 - used_day3' remaining.\n\nThis should tally with the given remaining bandages, which is 78. \n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\n# calculation verification\nday1_remaining = beginning_bandages + purchased_day1 - used_day1\nday2_remaining = day1_remaining - used_day2\nday3_remaining = day2_remaining + purchased_day3 - used_day3\n\nday3_remaining\n```"
