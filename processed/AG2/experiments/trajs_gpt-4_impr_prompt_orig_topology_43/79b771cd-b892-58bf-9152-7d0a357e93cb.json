Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

      "content": "To solve this problem, you need to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone, and then subtract the distance that the dragon's flames can reach from that number. \n\nThe first step is to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone. This distance can be calculated by multiplying the distance that she can throw the javelin without the gemstone by 3 since the gemstone increases her throwing distance by 3 times. \n\nThen, to find out how far she can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin, the distance that the dragon's flames can reach should be subtracted from the distance that Polly can throw the javelin.\n\nThe Python code for these calculations would look like this:\n```python\n# Distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone\njavelin_distance_without_gemstone = 4000\n\n# Multiplier effect of the gemstone\ngemstone_multiplier = 3\n\n# Distance the dragon's flames can reach\ndragon_flame_distance = 10000\n\n# Calculate distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone\njavelin_distance_with_gemstone = javelin_distance_without_gemstone * gemstone_multiplier\n\n# Calculate how far Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin\ndistance_from_dragon = javelin_distance_with_gemstone - dragon_flame_distance\n\nprint(distance_from_dragon)\n```\n\nIf you run this Python code, the output will be the distance that Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone."
