Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMartha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 12 families with 6 people and 15 families with 4 people. 16 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?"

We are told that 16 people didn't come due to illness and that 1/4 of this number (which is 16 * 1/4) had other commitments. \n\nThe result is the final number of people who attend Martha's party.\n\n```python\ninitial_people = (12*6) + (15*4)\nabsent_people = 16 + (16 * 1/4)\nattended_people = initial_people - absent_people\n\nprint(attended_people)\n```\nThis code gives the answer to the problem. Now, run the code and input the result for verification."

      "content": "Great! Now that we've calculated the number of attendees, we need to verify our solution to ensure we've followed the problem's constraints accurately.\n\nVerification Steps:\n\n1. We initially calculate the number of people invited by multiplying the number of families by the people in each family. For the first type of family, we have 12 * 6 (72), and for the second, we have 15 * 4 (60). Adding these values together gives us the total initial invited people, 72 + 60 = 132.\n\n2. From this total, we remove the people who couldn't attend the party. We are told 16 people didn't come due to illness, and an additional quarter of this number had other commitments. This gives us a total absentee count of 16 + 4 = 20.\n\n3. Finally, we subtract this absent count from the initial total to obtain the final number of attendees. This gives us the equation 132 - 20 = 112.\n\nIn conclusion, every step matches our expectations and constraints given by the problem. No decimal fractions were included, and our calculation remains a whole number as expected. \n\nSo, our final answer is correct: 112 people attended Martha's party. Thus, the \\boxed{112} is confirmed!"
