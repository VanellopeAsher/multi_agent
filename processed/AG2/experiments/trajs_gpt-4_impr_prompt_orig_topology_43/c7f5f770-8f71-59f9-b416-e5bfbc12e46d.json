Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGriffin had 30 french fries, but Kyle took 6 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. If in the end Griffin had 33 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?"

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: Step-by-Step Process\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nGriffin initially had 30 fries. Kyle took 6 which reduces Griffin's fries by 6. Billy took twice as much as Kyle, which is 2*6 = 12 fries. This reduces Griffin's fries by another 12. Ginger then gives Griffin some fries, so we will add a variable G to represent this. Finally, Colby takes 3 less than Kyle, which is 6-3 = 3 fries. This further reduces Griffin's fries by 3. Finally, according to the question, Griffin had 33 fries in the end.\n\nSo we can summarize the problem with the following equation:\n\n30 - 6 (Kyle) - 12 (Billy) + G (Ginger) - 3 (Colby) = 33\n\nStep 2: Formulate the equation and solve for G\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for G.\n\n```Python\nfrom sympy import *\n# declare the symbols \nG = symbols('G')\n# Solve for G\nsolve(30 - 6 - 12 + G - 3 - 33, G)\n```\nStep 3: Verify the solution\n```\nLet's use the result from our computation to replace G in our original equation to verify if our solution makes sense.\n```\nStep 4: Present the final solution\nThe final solution will be presented in the format boxed{_your_answer_}. \n\nLet's now proceed with the calculations."
