Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOf the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. If 3 of the automatic cars are currently rented out and 2 of the manual cars are under maintenance, what percentage of the remaining available cars are semi-automatic?"

      "content": "Based on the result, the percentage of the remaining available cars that are semi-automatic is approximately 26.67%.\n\nIn the verification stage, let's confirm whether this result is reasonable. The total number of cars is 20, and there are 12 automatic and 4 manual cars, so the number semi-automatic cars should be 4. The number of available cars should be 20 - 3 (rented automatic cars) - 2 (manual cars under maintenance) = 15. And out of these 15 available cars, 4 are semi-automatic, which is 26.67% of them.\n\nThis reasoning further reassures us that our result is correct. We conclude that about 26.67% of the total number of available cars for rent are semi-automatic.\n\nIn the format requested:\n\n\\boxed{26.67}"
