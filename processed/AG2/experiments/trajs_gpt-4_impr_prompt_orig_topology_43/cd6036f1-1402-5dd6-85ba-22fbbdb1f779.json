Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. During his recovery, he managed to regain 5 pounds per month for 2 months. If his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight before he fell ill?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved by reverse calculation. \n\nApproach:\n1) Mark lost weight for 3 months at the rate of 10 pounds per month, making for a total loss of 30 pounds. \n2) Then, he regained weight for 2 months at a rate of 5 pounds per month, for a total regain of 10 pounds.\n3) We know his final weight after recovery was 70 pounds. So, to find his initial weight, we will first subtract the regained weight from his final weight, and then add back the total weight that he lost. This is because the final weight has already taken into account the weight he regained, which was initially lost. \n\nLet's solve using Python:\n\n```python\n# defining the given variables\nfinal_weight_after_recovery = 70  # in pounds\nweight_loss_per_month_when_sick = 10  # in pounds\nsick_duration = 3  # in months\nweight_gain_per_month_during_recovery = 5  # in pounds\nrecovery_duration = 2  # in months\n\n# calculating weight adjustment during illness and recovery\ntotal_weight_loss_when_sick = weight_loss_per_month_when_sick * sick_duration\ntotal_weight_gain_during_recovery = weight_gain_per_month_during_recovery * recovery_duration\n\n# calculating the initial weight before illness\ninitial_weight = (final_weight_after_recovery + total_weight_loss_when_sick) - total_weight_gain_during_recovery\n\nprint(initial_weight)\n```\n\nIn this calculation:\n- The total weight lost during the sickness period is calculated by multiplying the rate of monthly weight loss by the duration of sickness.\n- The total weight gained during recovery is calculated by multiplying the rate of monthly weight gain by the recovery duration.\n- The initial weight is the sum of weight after recovery and weight loss during sickness, minus the weight gain during recovery."

      "content": "VERIFICATION: \n\nLet's ensure that the solution makes sense:\n\nConsider Mark's initial weight as 90 pounds.\n\n1) When he was sick for 3 months, he lost 10 pounds/month. So, the total weight lost is 3 months * 10 pounds/month = 30 pounds.\nReducing this from the initial weight: 90 pounds - 30 pounds = 60 pounds.\n\n2) During recovery, Mark regained weight for 2 months at the rate of 5 pounds/month. So, the total weight gained is 2 months * 5 pounds/month = 10 pounds.\nAdding this to the weight after losing during sickness: 60 pounds + 10 pounds = 70 pounds.\n\nThis is the same as his final weight mentioned in the problem statement, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\nHence, Mark's initial weight before he fell ill is \\boxed{90} pounds."
