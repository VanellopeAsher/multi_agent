Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAmora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 150 more corn chips than the number the others got.

      "content": "Alright! Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Amora and Lainey each received 700 corn chips. This means, the total number of chips that both of them received can be computed by taking the sum of their amounts.\n\n```python\nAmora_chips = 700\nLainey_chips = 700\n\n# total chips for Amora and Lainey\ntotal_chips_Amora_Lainey = Amora_chips + Lainey_chips\n```\n\nStep 2: According to the problem, Collins has 150 more chips than the other persons. This can be calculated by adding 150 to the quantity of chips that either Amora or Lainey received.\n\n```python\n# additional chips for Collins\nadditional_chips_Collins = 150\n\n# total chips for Collins\nCollins_chips = Amora_chips + additional_chips_Collins\n```\nStep 3: Now we need compute the total number of corn chips among all three persons. That can be found by adding the chips for Amora, Lainey, and Collins.\n\n```python\n# total chips among all of them\ntotal_chips = total_chips_Amora_Lainey + Collins_chips\n```\n\nCan you please help me compute the above queries?"

      "content": "Apologies for the confusion. I see that we've encountered an error due to insufficient information. Let's attempt to resolve this.\n\nTo solve the problem using the instructions:\n\nStep 1: First, find the total number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got. Since Amora and Lainey received an equal amount, sum their quantities.\n\n```python\nAmora_chips = 700\nLainey_chips = 700\n\n# total chips for both Amora and Lainey\ntotal_chips_Amora_Lainey = Amora_chips + Lainey_chips\nprint(total_chips_Amora_Lainey)\n```\n\nStep 2: Determine the quantity of corn chips Collins received. As per the problem statement, Collins should have received 150 more than either Amora or Lainey.\n\n```python\n# additional chips for Collins\nadditional_chips_Collins = 150\n\n# total chips for Collins\nCollins_chips = Amora_chips + additional_chips_Collins\nprint(Collins_chips)\n```\n\nStep 3: Finally, determine the total number of corn chips shared among all three individuals. This can be calculated by summing the quantities received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.\n\n```python\n# total chips among all of them\ntotal_chips = total_chips_Amora_Lainey + Collins_chips\nprint(total_chips)\n```\n\nPlease run the code blocks again with the print statements to display the results."

This matches our expectation since both of them received 700 chips each.\n\nCollins received 850 chips, which is exactly 150 more than what Amora and Lainey each got. This also aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements.\n\nThe total number of chips that were shared in total (Amora's, Lainey's, and Collins's) is 2,250 chips. This checks out because it matches the accumulated quantities each of them individually received.\n\nSince everything appears consistent with the problem statement, we can confidently present the result.\n\nSo, the total number of corn chips shared among Amora, Lainey, and Collins is $\\boxed{2250}$."
