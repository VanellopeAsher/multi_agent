Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKatherine has 50 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece. How much will she spend filling all 50 hanging baskets?"

      "content": "Let's approach this problem with a direct Python solution.\n\nWe need to calculate the total cost Katherine will spend for filling all 50 hanging baskets with flowers. We know that each basket requires 30 petunias and 20 sweet potato vines. We also know the price of each petunia and each sweet potato vine. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of all flowers required for one basket and then multiply that amount by 50 (since there are 50 baskets).\n\nHere is the corresponding Python code to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# defining the number of baskets and the number of each type of flower per basket\nnum_baskets = 50\nnum_petunias_per_basket = 30\nnum_vines_per_basket = 20\n\n# defining the cost of each type of flower\ncost_per_petunia = 3.00\ncost_per_vine = 2.50\n\n# calculating the total cost for one basket\ncost_per_basket = (num_petunias_per_basket * cost_per_petunia) + (num_vines_per_basket * cost_per_vine)\n\n# calculating the total cost for all baskets\ntotal_cost = num_baskets * cost_per_basket\n\n# printing the result\nprint(total_cost)\n````\n\nLet's go ahead with this computation."
