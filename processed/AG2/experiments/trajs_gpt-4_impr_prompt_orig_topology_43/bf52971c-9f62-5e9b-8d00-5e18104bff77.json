Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAli has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Ali's sister gives half of the money she receives to his mother.

      "content": "# Reasoning\n\nGiven that Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills, he has a total of 4*10 + 6*20 = $160.\n\nWhen Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has, he will give her half of $160 = $160/2 = $80. As a result, Ali will be left with $80.\n\nIf Ali uses 2/5 of the remaining amount of $60 to buy dinner, he will use (3/5)*$80 to buy dinner, leaving him with $80 - (3/5)*$80 = $80*(1 - 3/5).\n\nThus, Ali will have $80*(2/5) = $32 left after buying dinner.\n\n# Direct Python Solution \n\nLet's implement this in Python. We'll start by calculating the total amount of money Ali has and then subtract the amounts he gives away and uses to buy dinner."
