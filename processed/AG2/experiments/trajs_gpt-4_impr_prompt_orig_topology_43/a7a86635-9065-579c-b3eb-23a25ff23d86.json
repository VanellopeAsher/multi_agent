Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwo hundred kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 600 shells each.

Calculate the number of shells brought by all girls using the information that it's equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.\n4.

We have 200 kids that were divided equally between boys and girls. This gives us 100 boys and 100 girls. \n2. Each boy brought back 600 shells, so all the boys together brought back 100 * 600 = 60,000 shells. \n3. The girls collectively brought back an amount equal to what the boys brought plus four times as much. This is 60,000 + 4*60,000 = 300,000 shells. \n4. The number of shells brought back by each girl is the total number of shells divided by the number of girls. This is 300,000 / 100 = 3000.\n\nSince all calculations have checked out satisfactorily, the answer can now be stated with confidence:\n\nEach girl brought \boxed{3000} seashells back from the scavenger hunt."
