Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts.

      "content": "Approach:\n\nThis problem is straightforward and can be solved by direct calculation using Python. We first calculate total cost of labor (considering that each fraction of an hour is also charged as a full hour), then add this to the house call service fee and the cost of parts.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef total_plumbing_bill(service_fee, labor_rate, labor_hours, parts_costs):\n    total_labor_cost = math.ceil(labor_hours)*labor_rate\n    total_bill = service_fee + total_labor_cost + parts_costs\n    return total_bill\n\ntotal_plumbing_bill(40, 35, 2.25, 60)\n```"

      "content": "Verification:\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n\n1. Service fee: $40\n2. Labor cost: Since a fraction of an hour is counted as a full hour, 2.25 hours will count as 3 hours. So, labor cost is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105\n3. Cost of parts: $60\n\nAdding these up, we get $40 (service fee) + $105 (labor cost) + $60 (parts cost) = $205, which matches with our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total amount billed by Patty was $205.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{205}."
