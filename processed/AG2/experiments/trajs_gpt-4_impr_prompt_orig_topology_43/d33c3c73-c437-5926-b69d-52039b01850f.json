Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

Calculate the difference in water depths between Tuesday and Wednesday.\n4. Calculate the increase in water depth on Thursday, by taking half of the difference calculated in Step 3.\n5. Calculate the water depth on Thursday, by adding the increase calculated in Step 4 to the depth on Wednesday.\n\nLet's compute these steps using python code."

The depth on Monday is 17 feet.\n2. The depth on Tuesday is 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.\n3. The depth on Wednesday is 2/3 * 24 feet = 16 feet.\n4. The difference between the depths on Tuesday and Wednesday is 24 feet - 16 feet = 8 feet.\n5. The increase on Thursday is 1/2 * 8 feet = 4 feet.\n6. So, the depth on Thursday is 16 feet + 4 feet = 20 feet. \n\nIt is not possible for the tank's depth to reduce or increase to an unrealistic or unreasonable value, hence the solution \\boxed{20} feet makes sense in the context of the problem. \n\nTherefore, the water depth in the tank on Thursday is \\boxed{20} feet."
