Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

      "content": "This problem involves the solution of simple equations. Here are the key information we can get from the problem statement:\n\n1. Emil's age now is 21 years old.\n2. When Emil is 26 years old, he will be half the age of his dad which means his dad's age will be 52 years at that time.\n3. Also, when Emil is 26 years old, he will be twice as old as his brother which means his brother will be 13 years at that time.\n\nGiven these data, we can easily calculate Emil's dad's and brother's current ages.\n\nLet's execute these calculations in Python:\n\n```python\n# Existing age of Emil \nemil_current_age = 21\n\n# Given future age of Emil\nemil_future_age = 26 \n\n# His dad's age when Emil will be 26\ndad_future_age = 2 * emil_future_age\n\n# His brother's age when Emil will be 26\nbrother_future_age = emil_future_age / 2 \n\n# Number of years from now when Emil will be 26\nnum_years_future = emil_future_age - emil_current_age \n\n# Emil's dad's current age \ndad_current_age = dad_future_age - num_years_future \n\n# Emil's brother's current age\nbrother_current_age = brother_future_age - num_years_future \n\n# Sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now\ntotal_age = dad_current_age + brother_current_age \n\ntotal_age\n```\n\nPlease execute the above Python codes to get the result."

      "content": "Great! You've computed the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother to be 55 years. Now, let's move on to the verification step.\n\nVerification:\n1. Emil is currently 21 years old. After 5 years, he will be 26.\n2. At that point, his dad will be 52 years old (twice as old as Emil), which means his current age is 52 - 5 = 47 years old.\n3. Similarly, Emil's brother will be 13 years old (half of Emil's age), which means his current age is 13 - 5 = 8 years old.\n4. Adding the current age of his dad and the current age of his brother, we get a sum of 47 + 8 = 55 years.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is verified to be 55 years old.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{55}."
