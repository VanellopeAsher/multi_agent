Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?"

      "content": "The problem-solving approach appears to be a Direct Python Solution. The problem can be solved by writing a program using Python to implement the calculations as per the details provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe problem can be broken down into following steps\n1. We first need to find out how many gingerbreads and apple pies were sold on each day.\n2. Then, multiply quantity with respective prices to know the earning for each day.\n3. Finally, sum up the earnings for the three days.\n\nLet's break down the problem following these steps:\n\n1. Determine the quantities of gingerbreads and apple pies sold on each day\n - On Saturday, 10 boxes of gingerbreads were sold and 4 fewer apple pies than Sunday\n - On Sunday, he sold 5 more gingerbreads than he did on Saturday and 15 apple pies.\n - On Monday, he sold 2 gingerbreads and 4 apple pies.\n\n2. Multiply quantity with respective prices to know the earning for each day\n - Price of gingerbread = $6\n - Price of aaple pie = $15\n\n3. Sum up the earnings for the three days.\n\nThe Python code to calculate the result would be something like this:\n\n```python\n# prices\nprice_gingerbread = 6\nprice_apple_pie = 15\n\n# quantities \nsat_gingerbread = 10\nsun_gingerbread = sat_gingerbread + 5\nmon_gingerbread = 2\n\nsun_apple_pie = 15\nsat_apple_pie = sun_apple_pie - 4\nmon_apple_pie = 4\n\n# total earnings\ntotal_earning = (sat_gingerbread + sun_gingerbread + mon_gingerbread)*price_gingerbread + (sat_apple_pie + sun_apple_pie + mon_apple_pie)*price_apple_pie\n\nprint(total_earning)\n```\n\nLet's use this code to calculate the total earnings."
