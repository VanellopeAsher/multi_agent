Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6.6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2.5 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

In a more precise form, it's 23.2 hours.\n\nNow let's verify our answer:\n\n- First, we determined that the time John spent swimming was half the time he spent boating, which is 3.3 hours.\n- Then, we found that the total time John spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows was 17.4 hours.\n- Using the information that this time is 30% of his total vacation time, we calculated his total vacation time to be 58 hours.\n- Finally, by using the fact that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we computed that he spent 23.2 hours sightseeing.\n\nOur method for arriving at each step is mathematically sound, and our calculations have been thoroughly checked to ensure they are correct.\n\nTherefore, John spent 23.2 hours sightseeing during his vacation.\n\nHence, my final answer is \\boxed{23.2}."
