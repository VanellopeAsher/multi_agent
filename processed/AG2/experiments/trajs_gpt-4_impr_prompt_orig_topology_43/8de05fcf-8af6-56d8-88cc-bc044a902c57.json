Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "Firstly, let's find out the number of articles written by Meredith on Tuesday. From the problem statement, we know that she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than she did on Monday.\n\nThen, we'll find out how many hours she spent writing on Monday and Tuesday. After that we will subtract these hours from the total hours she spent on writing in the three days. This will give us the time she spent writing on Wednesday. \n\nFrom there, we can calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday, since we know that each article takes her 4 hours to research and write.\n\nFinally, we calculate how many times as many articles she wrote on Wednesday as she wrote on Tuesday. Let's execute these steps using Python."

      "content": "This means that Meredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.\n\nNow, let's look at the verification of the solution.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. On Monday, the number of articles written by Meredith is 5, so the time spent was 5 * 4 = 20 hours.\n2. On Tuesday, the number of articles written by Meredith was 2/5 times more than on Monday, so she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, and consequently, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.\n3. The total time spent writing articles in three days is given as 104 hours. \n4. The time spent writing on Wednesday is 104 - 20 - 28 = 56 hours, which means Meredith wrote 56 / 4 = 14 articles, since each article takes 4 hours.\n5. The ratio of the articles written on Wednesday to the articles written on Tuesday is 14 : 7, which simplifies to 2 : 1.\n\nThis verifies our solution, so the final answer is that Meredith wrote \\boxed{2} times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday."
