Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes.

So we need to compute 80% of the total number of days to get the days that Billy is actually working. \n\nThen to know the total number of hours Billy works, we need to multiply the total number of days Billy works by 3 hours each day.\n\nFinally, we will find out how many people Billy helps per hour by dividing the total number of people he helps (240 people) by the total number of hours he works.\n\nLet's compute these in Python."

This means that Billy helped 2 people per hour.\n\nVerification:\n\n- We found out the total number of days from March 1 to April 19, which is 31 + 19 = 50 days.\n- Billy worked for 80% of these days, which amounts to 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.\n- Given that he worked 3 hours a day, the total working hours amount to 40 * 3 = 120 hours.\n- Given that Billy helped 240 people in total, the number of people he can help per hour is 240 people / 120 hours = 2 people per hour.\n\nThis confirms that our computation is correct.\n\nTherefore, Billy helps \\boxed{2} people per hour."
