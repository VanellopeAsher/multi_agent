Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWhile on vacation, John decides to engage in a variety of activities.

      "content": "The problem can be solved step-by-step as follows:\n\n1. Find out how much time John spent in total on activities.\n2. Find out how much time John spent sightseeing from the total time he spent on activities.\n\nLet's execute these steps.\n\n1. Calculation of total time spent on activities:\n\n   a. John spent 6 hours boating.\n   b. He spent half the boating time, i.e., 6/2 = 3 hours swimming.\n   c. John watched 3 different shows that were 2 hours each, i.e., 3*2 = 6 hours.\n   d. These activities accounted for 30% of his total time spent. Hence the total time he spent can be calculated as: total_time = 100 * (boating hours + swimming hours + show hours) / 30\n   \n\n2. The amount of time John spent sightseeing is 40% of the total time he spent. So, we can calculate sightseeing time as: sightseeing time = total_time * 40/100\n\nLet's compute these using python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# set the values\nboating_hours = 6\nswimming_hours = boating_hours / 2\nshow_hours = 2 * 3\n\n# calculate total time\ntotal_time = 100 * (boating_hours + swimming_hours + show_hours) / 30\n\n# calculate sightseeing time\nsightseeing_time = total_time * 40 / 100\n\nsightseeing_time\n```\nLet's check the result."

      "content": "After running the given code, we find that John spent 20 hours sightseeing.\n\nVerification:\nDouble-checking the calculations:\n\n1. The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:\n  boating : 6 hours\n  swimming: 3 hours (half of boating time)  \n  shows  : 6 hours\n  These activities took a total of 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours, which accounts for 30% of his total time spent.\n\n2. Hence, the total time spent on activities can be calculated as: total_time = 100 * (total hours of boating, swimming, and shows) / 30 = 100 * 15 / 30 = 50 hours\n\n3. Now, John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing = total_time * 40% = 50 * 40/100 = 20 hours.\n\nHence, both the calculated and expected answers match.\n\nSo, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20}."
