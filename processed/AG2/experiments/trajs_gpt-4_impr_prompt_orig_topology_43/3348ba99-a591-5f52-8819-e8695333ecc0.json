Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMark took a test yesterday that consisted of 7.5 sets of ten questions. He completed the test at a rate of 0.5 sets of ten questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 10 sets of ten questions at the same rate. If Mark had 0.8 sets of ten hours to complete the first test and 0.6 sets of ten hours to complete the second one, how many sets of ten questions did he leave incomplete?"

Calculate total sets of questions for both tests by summing up the numbers from the two test days.\n2. Compute the total available time Mark had to finish both tests.\n3. Using the rate of completion (0.5 sets/hour), find out how many sets Mark could have completed within the available time.\n4. Subtract the number of sets Mark could have completed from the total number of sets to get the number of incomplete sets. \n\nLet's execute these steps using Python."

Total time Mark had for the two tests is: 0.8 hours + 0.6 hours = 1.4 hours\n3. At a rate of 0.5 sets of ten questions per hour, Mark could finish: 0.5 sets/hour * 1.4 hours = 0.7 sets in the given time\n4. According to the information given, Mark didn't complete: 17.5 sets - 0.7 sets = 16.8 sets\n5. Since a set is 10 questions and we can't have a fraction of a set, we need to round 16.8 sets up to 17 sets\n\nThe Verification process confirms the correctness of our calculation.\n\nSo, Mark didn't complete \\boxed{17} sets of ten questions."
