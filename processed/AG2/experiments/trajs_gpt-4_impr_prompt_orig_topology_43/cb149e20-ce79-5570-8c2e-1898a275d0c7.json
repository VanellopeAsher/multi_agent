Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera. Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera after the allowance and the money from selling picture. How much is the camera?"

We'll add up all the money Jayden has and that he still needs.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Calculate how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava gave half of her $90 allowance, so we'll compute half of 90.\n2. Add the money Jayden initially had ($70), the money Ava gave him, and the additional money Jayden needs ($85).\n\nLet's implement this solution in Python.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Ava's contribution \nava_contribution = 90 / 2 \n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the camera\ncamera_cost = 70 + ava_contribution + 85\ncamera_cost\n```\n\nWe can execute this code in Python to get the result."

Ava contributed half of her $90 allowance. Half of 90 equals $45, which is correct.\n2. We then added up all the components of Jayden's savings: the initial $70 from selling pictures, the $45 Ava gave him, and the $85 he still needs. Summing these amounts gives us $200.\n\nTherefore, the calculation appears sound, and the result is likely correct.\n\nThe final cost of the camera is \\boxed{200}."
