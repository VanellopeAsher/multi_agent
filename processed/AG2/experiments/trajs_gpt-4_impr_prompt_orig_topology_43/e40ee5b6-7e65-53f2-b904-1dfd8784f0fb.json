Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nAt the dairy shop, Cecelia discovered that a jar of one gallon is priced $2 higher than a jar of half a gallon. Given that the price of a one-gallon jar is $5, can you determine the total sum of money she expended on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon?"

      "content": "Verification:\n\nLet's verify our result by tracing how we determined half_gallon_price and total_cost.\n\n- We obtained half_gallon_price using the formula: gallon_price - 2\n- Substituting the value of gallon_price (5) into the formula, we find that half_gallon_price is 3, which seems correct.\n  \n- We calculated total_cost using another formula: 10*gallon_price + 16*half_gallon_price\n- Plugging in the values (gallon_price=5 and half_gallon_price=3), our calculation becomes: 10*5 + 16*3, which equals 98. \n\nTherefore, our final result matches the computed total_cost.\n\nFinal Answer: \nThe total amount that Cecelia spent on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon is $\boxed{98}."
