Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn runs 100 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 10 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?"

Using the given information, we can first determine the total time John spends running every week, and then determine his running speed.\n\nLet's summarize the information:\n- Total distance per week: 100 miles\n- Total days per week: 3 days\n- Running hours: 10 hours on the first day, and half that for the next two days\n\nWe can calculate the total hours John spends running, and then calculate his speed using the formula Speed = Distance / Time.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Number of hours John runs on the first day\nhours_first_day = 10\n\n# Number of hours John runs on the next two days\nhours_next_two_days = 0.5 * hours_first_day * 2\n\n# Total number of hours John runs in a week\ntotal_hours = hours_first_day + hours_next_two_days\n\n# Total distance John runs in a week\ntotal_distance = 100\n\n# Calculate John's speed\nspeed = total_distance / total_hours\n\n# Simplify the result (turn it into a fraction)\nspeed = sp.nsimplify(speed)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(speed)\n```\n\nThe result will be John's average running speed in miles per hour."
