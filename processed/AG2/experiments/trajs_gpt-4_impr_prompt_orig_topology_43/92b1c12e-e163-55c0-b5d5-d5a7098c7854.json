Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCarver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. How old is his son, in years?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll employ three equations based on the information given in the problem statement:\n\n1. Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter. If we let D represent the daughter's age, we have: `2D - 5 = 45`\n\n2. His daughter is 4 years older than three times the age of his son. If we let S represent the son's age, we can express this as: `D = 3S + 4`\n\n3. Substitute the value of D from equation 2 into equation 1, and solve for S.\n\nWe can perform these calculations in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve\n\nD, S = symbols('D S')  # D for daughter, S for son\n# Equation 1: 2D - 5 = 45\nequation1 = 2*D - 5 - 45\n# Equation 2: D = 3S + 4\nequation2 = D - 3*S - 4\n\n# Combine equation 1 and 2, solve for S\nage_of_son = solve((equation1, equation2), (D, S))\nprint(age_of_son[S])\n```\n\nLet's now run the Python script to solve for the age of the son."

Subtracting 5 from 50 gives 45, which is Carver's age satisfying equation 1: 2D - 5 = 45.\n\nSo everything adds up correctly, and our result is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThus, we verify that the son is 7 years old, so the final answer is \boxed{7}."
