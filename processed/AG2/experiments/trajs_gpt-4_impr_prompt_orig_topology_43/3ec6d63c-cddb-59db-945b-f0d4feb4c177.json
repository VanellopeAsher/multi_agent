Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are 80 deer in a field.  30 percent of them are bucks.  50 percent of the bucks are 6 points.  How many 6 point bucks are there?"

Then, we'll calculate how many of these bucks are 6 points.\n\nWe can utilize Python to efficiently perform these calculations.\n\nLet's start coding:\n\n```python\n# Number of deer\ntotal_deer = 80\n# Percentage of bucks\nbucks_percent = 30\n# Percentage of 6 point bucks\nsix_point_percent = 50\n\n# Calculate the number of bucks\nbucks = (total_deer * bucks_percent) / 100\n# Calculate the number of 6 point bucks\nsix_point_bucks = (bucks * six_point_percent) / 100\n\n# Print the number of 6 point bucks\nprint(six_point_bucks)\n```\n\nThis code will tell us the number of 6 point bucks among the total deer population."

Now, before providing the final answer, let's ensure that we've followed all the problem-solving steps and verified the solution.\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\nSteps:\n1. We started with 80 deer in total.\n2. 30 percent of them were bucks, giving us 30/100 * 80 = 24 bucks.\n3. 50 percent of these bucks had 6 points, resulting in 50/100 * 24 = 12 six point bucks.\n\nWe can confirm from our calculations that 12 deer are six point bucks.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the question \"How many 6 point bucks are there?\" is boxed{12}."
