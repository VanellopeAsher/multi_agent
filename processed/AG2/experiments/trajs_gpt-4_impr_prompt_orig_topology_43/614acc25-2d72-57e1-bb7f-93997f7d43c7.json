Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLast night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?"

      "content": "This problem involves interpreting and implementing a word problem in Python. We are provided with three critical pieces of information. First, Rick killed ten wolves yesterday. Second, today he killed three times as many wolves as he did cougars. Third, he killed three fewer cougars today than he killed wolves yesterday. We are required to determine the total number of animals killed by Rick.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to solve this problem:\n\nSteps:\n1. Since Rick killed 3 fewer cougars than the wolves he killed yesterday, we'll assign the number of cougars killed yesterday to be 10 + 3 = 13.\n2. Based on the problem, the number of wolves Rick kill today is three times the number of cougars he kill today, which means the number of wolves Rick kill today is 3*(13-3) = 30.\n3. Combine the number of animals Rick killed yesterday and today to get the total number.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python. \n\n```python\n# cougars killed yesterday\ncougars_yesterday=10+3\n# wolves killed today\nwolves_today=3*(cougars_yesterday-3)\n# total animals killed\ntotal=10+cougars_yesterday+wolves_today+(cougars_yesterday-3)\nprint(total) \n```\nPlease run the above Python code and provide the results to continue the problem-solving process."

Cougars Killed Yesterday: \nWe used the information that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the wolves, he killed yesterday to ascertain that the number of cougars he killed yesterday was 13. This is because 10 (Number of wolves killed yesterday) + 3 = 13.\n\n2. Wolves Killed Today: \nThe problem states that Rick killed three times as many wolves as he did cougars today. Using the derived number of cougars he killed today (13 - 3 = 10), we find that the number of wolves killed today is 30. \n\n3. Total Animals Killed:\nBy summing the wolves and cougars killed yesterday and today, we find that the total number of animals killed by Rick is 63.\n\n   Wolves Yesterday = 10\n   Cougars Yesterday = 13\n   Wolves Today = 30\n   Cougars Today = 10\n   Total Animals Killed = 10 + 13 + 30 + 10 = 63\n\nGiven the verification process corroborates the calculated results, we can confidently say that our solution is correct. As such, the total number of animals that Rick killed is calculated to be 63.\n\nThus, the final answer is \bboxed{63}."
