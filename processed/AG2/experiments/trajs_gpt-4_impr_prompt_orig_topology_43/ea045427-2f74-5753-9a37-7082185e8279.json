Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each. William bought five notebooks and a ballpen. He also decided to buy a pencil case that costs twice as much as the total cost of one notebook and two ballpens. How much did he spend in all?"

A pencil case costs twice as much as one notebook and two ballpens.\n\nTo find the total amount that William spent, we need to sum up the costs of the notebooks, the ballpen, and the pencil case.\n\nWe can proceed directly with these calculations in Python.\n\n```python\nnotebook_price = 1.5\nballpen_price = 0.5\nnotebook_quantity = 5\nballpen_quantity = 1\n\nnotebook_total = notebook_price * notebook_quantity\nballpen_total = ballpen_price * ballpen_quantity\n\npencil_case_price = 2 * (notebook_price + 2 * ballpen_price)\ntotal_spent = notebook_total + ballpen_total + pencil_case_price\n\ntotal_spent\n```"

William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each, yielding a total of 5 * 1.5 = $7.50.\n2. He bought one ballpen at $0.5, bringing the running total to 7.5 + 0.5 = $8.00.\n3. The cost of a pencil case is twice the price of one notebook and two ballpens: 2 * (1.5 + 2 * 0.5) = $5.00.\n4. Adding that cost to the running total, we obtain 8.0 + 5.0 = $13.00, which is indeed the value we computed.\n\nThe solution is verified as correct.\n\nSo, William spent $13.00. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{13}."
