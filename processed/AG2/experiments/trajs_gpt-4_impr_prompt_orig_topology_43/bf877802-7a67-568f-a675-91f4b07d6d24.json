Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.

      "content": "The problem invovles simple calculations of angles based on given rates and times. Specifically, we are given initial angle of the sun, the angle change rate per hour, and the duration of time the sun moves at this rate, then a new rate and duration. To calculate the final angle of the sun from the ground, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total angle change during the first sun movement's duration by multiplying rate and time.\n2. Calculate the total angle change during the second sun movement's duration similarly.\n3. Sum the initial angle and the two total angle changes to find the final angle of the sun from the ground.\n\nLet's implement these steps in a Python program. We'll start by defining our variables and move to the calculations.\n\n```python\n# define variables\ninitial_angle = 32  # initial angle of the sun (degrees)\nfirst_rate = 5  # degree change rate during the first movement (degrees/hour)\nfirst_time = 10  # duration of the first sun movement (hours)\nsecond_rate = 3  # degree change rate during the second movement (degrees/hour)\nsecond_time = 2  # duration of the second sun movement (hours)\n\n# calculate total angle change for the first movement\nfirst_total_change = first_rate * first_time\n\n# calculate total angle change for the second movement\nsecond_total_change = second_rate * second_time\n\n# calculate the final angle from the ground to the sun\nfinal_angle = initial_angle + first_total_change + second_total_change\n\nprint(final_angle)\n```\nThe Variable `final_angle` contains final degree after the movement of the sun.\n\nHowever, Please note, angle is typically measured within a range of 0 - 360 degrees, so if `final_angle` is above 360, we would want to adjust this by finding the remainder when divided by 360 (`final_angle % 360`). If the `final_angle` is within the range, then use it as it is. Let's execute the python program to get final result."

      "content": "Great! The final angle from the ground to the sun after the defined movements is \boxed{88} degrees. \n\nVerification:\n\nLet's verify the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. We calculated the total angle change for the first sun movement: 5 degrees/hour x 10 hours = 50 degrees.\n2. Next, we calculated the angle change for the second movement: 3 degrees/hour x 2 hours = 6 degrees.\n3. The initial angle was given as 32 degrees, and accordingly, the final angle was determined: 32 degrees (initial) + 50 degrees (first movement) + 6 degrees (second movement) = 88 degrees.\n4. Finally, we checked if our final angle falls within the typical range for angles (0 - 360 degrees), and it does. \n\nAll these verification steps confirm that our solution, \boxed{88} degrees, is correct."
