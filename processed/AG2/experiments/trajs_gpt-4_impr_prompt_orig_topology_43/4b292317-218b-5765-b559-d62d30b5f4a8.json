Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarty has 10,000 millimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 40 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 50 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?"

The second division: Each of these parts is then divided into 50 equal parts.\n3. Output: The length of the final cuts. \n\nLet's write the Python code for this. \n\n```python\n# total length of the ribbon in millimeters\nribbon_length_mm = 10000\n\n# initial number of cuts\ncuts = 40\n\n# further division of each cut\nfurther_cuts = 50\n\n# calculate the length of each final cut\nfinal_cut_length = ribbon_length_mm / (cuts * further_cuts)\n\nprint(final_cut_length)\n```\n\nAbove Python code divides the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts (both initial and further cuts) to get the length of each final cut."

Verify the result by multiplying the final cut length by the total number of cuts. The result should equal the initial total length of the ribbon.\n2. Please follow the Python code below:\n\n```python\n# verification\ntotal_length = final_cut_length * cuts * further_cuts\n\nprint(total_length)\n```\n\nImplementing this will confirm whether our answer is correct. If the verification result equals the initial total length of the ribbon (10000 mm), then our solution is verified."

After the verification process, we also got 10000 millimeters as the total length when we multiplied the length of each final cut by the total number of cuts. This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is that each final cut will be 5 millimeters long. We will represent this value using boxed notation as indicated in the guidelines.\n\nThe final length of each ribbon cut is \\boxed{5}."
