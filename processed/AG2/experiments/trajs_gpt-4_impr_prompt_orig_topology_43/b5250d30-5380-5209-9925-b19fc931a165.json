Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery Saturday, Jill along with her companions view 4 films and on Sundays, they watch half as many films as they do on Saturdays. If this routine is followed every weekend, what is the total number of films they can view in a span of 4 weeks?"

Calculate the total films viewed in a week (Saturday + Sunday). \n3. Multiply this result by the number of weeks to get the total films viewed in 4 weeks.\n\nLet's implement this in code,\n\n```python\n# number of films they watch on Saturday\nfilms_on_saturday = 4\n# number of films they watch on Sunday\nfilms_on_sunday = films_on_saturday / 2\n# total films they watch in a week\nfilms_per_week = films_on_saturday + films_on_sunday\n# total films they watch in 4 weeks\ntotal_films = films_per_week * 4\nprint(total_films)\n```"

According to the problem, Jill and her companions watch 4 movies every Saturday. So, if there are 4 weeks, they will watch 4 * 4 = 16 movies in total on Saturdays. \n2. On Sundays, they watch half the number of movies they did on Saturdays, which is 2 movies. So, over 4 weeks, they will watch 4 * 2 = 8 movies in total on Sundays.\n3. So, their total count of movies watched in 4 weeks will be 16 (from Saturdays) + 8 (from Sundays) = 24\n\nThe Python code, as well as the step-by-step verification, both correctly yield that Jill and her companions will watch 24 movies in a span of 4 weeks.\n\nHence, the final answer is \\boxed{24}."
