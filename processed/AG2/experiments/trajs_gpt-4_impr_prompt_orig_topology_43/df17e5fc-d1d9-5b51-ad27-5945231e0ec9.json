Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it. They are red, white, purple, and yellow.   Half the mural is yellow. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, calculate how many pints of red paint was used."

      "content": "Approach:\n\nThe problem states that half the mural is yellow and the remaining half is split equally among red, white, and purple. Thus, each of these colors takes up a third of the remaining half of the mural. Because the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we first find half that amount (representing the yellow portion). Then we divide the remaining pints of paint equally among the other three colors to find how many pints of red paint were used.\n\nLet's execute these calculations in Python:\n\n```python\ntotal_paint = 12 # pints\nyellow_paint = total_paint / 2\nremaining_paint = total_paint - yellow_paint\nred_paint = remaining_paint / 3\nprint(red_paint)\n```"

The total paint used is 12 pints.\n2. Half of the mural is yellow, so 12/2=6 pints of yellow paint was used.\n3. The remaining 6 pints were split equally among the red, white, and purple paints.\n4. So, each of these three colors used 6/3=2 pints of paint.\n\nGiven our reasoning and calculated results, are both consistent. Hence, the final quantity of red paint used is: 2 pints.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}"
