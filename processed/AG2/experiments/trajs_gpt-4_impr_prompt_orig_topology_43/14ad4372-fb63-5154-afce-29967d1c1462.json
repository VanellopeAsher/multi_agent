      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJudy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday, and 8 classes on Saturday. On Sundays, she takes a break and doesn't teach any classes. Each class has 15 students. She charges $15.00 per student for each class. Additionally, she offers a free 5-minute warm-up session before each class, which doesn't affect her earnings. How much money does she make in 1 week?"

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will first need to calculate how many classes Judy conducts in a week by breaking it down into a weekday and weekend. \n\nHere is a step-by-step plan for our calculation:\n1. Calculate the number of classes Judy conducts each weekday (5 days).\n2. Calculate the number of classes Judy conducts each Saturday.\n3. By adding totals from steps 1 and 2, we will find the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.\n4. Since the number of students per class and the fee per student are consistent, we can multiply the total number of classes by the revenue per class to find Judy's weekly earnings.\n\nThis whole calculation can be performed in Python. Let's do it now. \n\n```python\n# Number of weekdays\nnum_weekdays = 5\n\n# Number of classes per weekday\nclasses_weekday = 5\n\n# Number of classes per Saturday\nclasses_saturday = 8\n\n# Number of students per class\nnum_students = 15\n\n# Fee per student\nfee_per_student = 15\n\n# Total number of classes in a week\ntotal_classes = num_weekdays * classes_weekday + classes_saturday\n\n# Total earnings in a week\ntotal_earnings = total_classes * num_students * fee_per_student\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```"

Total number of classes per week: 25 classes (weekday) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes/week\n4. The total earnings per week is calculated as: 33 classes/week * 15 students/class * $15.00/student/class = $7425.00/week\n\nThese numbers align with the code we wrote and the output you provided. Therefore, the weekly earnings are indeed correct.\n\nThe total money Judy makes in 1 week is $\u001b[4m7425\u001b[0m."
