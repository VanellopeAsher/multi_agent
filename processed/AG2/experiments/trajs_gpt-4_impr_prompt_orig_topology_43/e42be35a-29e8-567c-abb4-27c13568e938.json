Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGreta wanted brownies for her birthday.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we will adopt the 'Direct Python Solution' approach as it simply involve arithmetic calculations involving numbers of brownies. The required solution can be obtained through the following steps:\n\n1. We first calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the party. One dozen is equal to 12, hence, there were 12 (for the batch Greta made for herself) + 6 (1/2 a dozen from her office) + 48 (4 dozens from her friends at the party) = 12 + 6 + 48.\n2. From the total, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party, which is equal to 1.5 dozens, i.e., 18 brownies.\n3. The result will be the total number of brownies Greta had at the end of the day.\n\nLet's perform these calculations in Python."

Total brownies before the party = 12 (from Greta herself) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66.\n2. Brownies eaten at the party = 1.5 dozen = 18.\n3. Total brownies left = Total before party - Eaten at party = 66 - 18 = 48.\n\nSince the solution matches our calculation perfectly, we can conclude that our solution is correct.\nSo, Greta had \u0001oxed{48.0} brownies left over from the entire day."
