Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nUpon the conclusion of the academic year, Kate requested her instructor for the 3 containers of 64 crayons that were all reduced to tiny fragments. The instructor consented. Kate brought the crayons to her house and chose to create crayon muffins by fusing 8 tiny fragments of crayons in a muffin tin that she heated in an oven for a short period.

      "content": "The problem consists of three main parts. First, we need to find out how many crayon fragments Kate has. Then, we need to determine how many crayon muffins Kate can make from those fragments, and finally, we will calculate the total money that Kate can earn by selling those crayon muffins. Therefore, I would use Python for the calculations.\n\nLet's start with the first step, finding out how many crayon fragments Kate has. Each container contains 64 crayons, and she has 3 containers. That means Kate has 64 * 3 = 192 crayon fragments.\n\nNow we will move on to the second step, where we need to find out how many crayon muffins Kate can make. Since she uses 8 fragments per muffin, she can make 192 / 8 = 24 muffins.\n\nFinally, we come to the last step where we find out how much money Kate can earn. The crayon muffins are sold for $1.50 each, so if we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin, we can find out the total money she can earn. \n\nThe Python code for these calculations is presented below:\n\n```python\n# number of crayons per container\ncrayons_per_container = 64\n\n# total containers\ntotal_containers = 3\n\n# total crayons\ntotal_crayons = crayons_per_container * total_containers\n\n# fragments per muffin\nfragments_per_muffin = 8\n\n# price of each muffin\nprice_per_muffin = 1.5\n\n# total muffins that can be made\ntotal_muffins = total_crayons / fragments_per_muffin\n\n# total money that can be earned\ntotal_money = total_muffins * price_per_muffin\n\nprint(total_money)\n```\nSo we just need to run the code and get the result."

Now let's verify the results. \n\nVERIFICATION \n\nThe given conditions are: \n\n- There were 3 containers of 64 crayons each, so that is a total of 3*64 = 192 crayons\n- 8 pieces of crayons were used to make each muffin, so the total number of muffins made is 192/8 = 24 muffins\n- Each muffin is sold for $1.50, so the total amount earned is calculated by multiplying the number of muffins made by the price per muffin, which is 24 * 1.5 = $36\n\nThe Python calculation of 36.0 matches with our manual calculation of $36. Therefore, the answer is verified and correct. \n\nSo, the total amount of money that Kate can earn by selling the crayon muffins is $36. \n\nPresenting the same in the desired format, we get \n\nThe total amount of money that Kate can earn is $\boxed{36}."
