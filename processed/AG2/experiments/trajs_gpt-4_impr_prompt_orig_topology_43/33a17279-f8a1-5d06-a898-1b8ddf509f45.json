Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSuzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her and donated $15 to a local charity. How much money does she have left from her earnings?"

      "content": "Great, now let's go over the verification process:\n\n1. **Breathe and think**: Take a moment to clear your head.\n2. **Compare against the problem statement**: Does this answer, $285, make sense for the problem? Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each, which yields $320. She gave away $10 to each of her two sisters and $15 to charity, which totals to $35. Subtracting her expenses from her income indeed results in $285.\n3. **Check the computation method**: Did we arrive at this result in a sensible way? Yes, we performed subtraction of total expenses from total income, which fits this scenario.\n4. **Consider possible errors**: What could have gone wrong? We might have added instead of subtracted, or messed up the multiplication during the income calculations. But looking at the code, neither of these errors seems to have occurred.\n5. **Check the math**: Does the arithmetic check out? Yes, the mathematics used in this computation is correct.\n\nHaving verified all this, I am confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, Suzanne has \\boxed{285} dollars left from her earnings."
