Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Calculate the total number of articles the two websites published together in February if there are 2.8 times of ten days in the month."

We can solve this by first finding the total amount of articles each website posts in a day, sum them up, then multiply by the number of days in the month.\n\nLet's break this problem down into a step by step process:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of articles the first website publishes in one day.\n2. Calculate the total number of articles the second website publishes in one day.\n3. Add the two figures to get the total number of articles published per day.\n4. Find out the exact number of days in February.\n5. Multiply the total number of articles published per day by the number of days in February.\n\nLet's solve each step:\n\nStep 1: The first website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.\nStep 2: The sister company (the second website) publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.\nStep 3: Finalize the total number of articles published per day by the two websites.\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of days in February. As stated in the problem, February has 2.8 times of ten days. The calculation can be done directly.\n\nNow let's solve steps 1, 2, and 3 using Python."

Verify the solution step by step.\n   - Step 1: The first website publishes 20 articles daily. Important: the rate is average and reasonable.\n   - Step 2: The sister company publishes 10 articles daily. Important: this rate is considered average and is also reasonable.\n   - Step 3: Adding the articles published by the two websites, we get 30 articles per day. \n   - Step 4: We calculated February to have 28 days. The statement 2.8 times of ten days aligns with the standard length of February in a common year.\n   - Step 5: We then multiplied the total articles per day (30) by the number of days in February (28), giving a total of 840 articles.\n3. All steps and results have been verified and are correct.\n\nThus, the final answer, boxed, is \\boxed{840}."
