Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nLeah just got a new kitten. Spaying her cost $200, her 3 vaccines cost $20 each, but Leah got a 10% discount on the total vaccine cost, and the kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each. How much has the kitten cost so far?"

      "content": "We'll use the Direct Python Solution approach here to solve the problem.\n\nStep by Step Calculation:\n\n1. Total Cost for vaccines = No of vaccines * cost of each vaccine.\n\n2. Calculate the Discounted amount = Total cost of vaccines * Discount rate in decimal.\n\n3. Calculate the total price after discount = Total cost of vaccines - Discounted amount.\n\n4. Calculate the cost for all the vases the kitten broke = No of vases * cost of each vase.\n\n5. Then we would sum the cost for spaying, the vaccines after the discount, and the vases' cost to get the total amount Leah has spent so far.\n\nHere is the python code to calculate the total cost.\n\n```python\nspaying_cost = 200\n\nvaccine_cost_per_vaccine = 20\ntotal_vaccine_cost = 3 * vaccine_cost_per_vaccine\n\ndiscount_rate = 10 / 100\ndiscounted_amount = total_vaccine_cost * discount_rate\n\ntotal_price_after_discount = total_vaccine_cost - discounted_amount\n\nvase_cost_per_vase = 12\ntotal_vase_cost = 4 * vase_cost_per_vase\n\nfinal_total_cost = spaying_cost + total_price_after_discount + total_vase_cost\nprint(final_total_cost)\n```\n\nAfter running the python code, provide the result you got."

Calculate discounted amount on vaccines:\n$60 * 10% = $6\n3. Calculate total vaccine cost after discount\n$60 - $6 = $54\n4. Calculate total vase cost:\n$12 per vase * 4 vases = $48\n5. Finally, sum all costs:\n$200 (spaying) + $54 (vaccines after discount) + $48 (vases) = $302\n\nEverything accurately matches the $302 which was calculated in the Python code. Therefore, the total cost that Leah has spent on her kitten so far is \\boxed{302}."
