Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMonica is preparing to adorn Christmas presents with bows. She has 6 presents for her family members, 4 presents for her buddies, and 2 presents for her educators. She possesses 144 inches of ribbon for this task. What is the length in inches of ribbon that she can allocate for each present's bow?"

Additionally, she has 144 inches of ribbon. Therefore, we can calculate the length of ribbon she can allocate to each present by dividing the total length of the ribbon by the total number of presents.\n\nHere's the Python code for our computations:\n\n```python\npresents_for_family = 6\npresents_for_buddies = 4\npresents_for_teachers = 2\n\ntotal_presents = presents_for_family + presents_for_buddies + presents_for_teachers\n\ntotal_ribbon_length = 144\n\nribbon_per_present = total_ribbon_length / total_presents\n\nprint(ribbon_per_present) # How much ribbon she can allocate to each present  \n```"

The result of our computation is 12.0 inches which means that Monica can allocate 12 inches of ribbon for each present's bow.\n\nLet's proceed to verification.\n\nVerification:\n1. She has a total of 12 presents (6 for family, 4 for friends, 2 for teachers).\n2. She has 144 inches of ribbon.\n3. Dividing 144 inches by 12 presents gives 12 inches per present.\n\nThis suggests our computation method indeed leads to a correct answer.\n\nTherefore, Monica can allocate 12 inches of ribbon for each present. The final answer is \\boxed{12}."
