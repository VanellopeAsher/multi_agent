Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nIn a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten. One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?"

      "content": "The problem can be solved by first calculating the age of each sibling, then summing all those values.\n\nThe first step: find the age of the sisters and the brothers.\n- All the sisters are the same age, which is 1.6 times of ten. Therefore, each sister's age is 1.6 * 10 = 16 years old.\n- One of the brothers is 3/5 of 20 years old. This implies the age of one brother is 20 * (3/5) = 12 years old.\n- The younger brother is half the age of the older one. Hence, the age of the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n\nFinally, sum the total age of all siblings: the three sisters each have an age of 16, and the two brothers' ages are 12 and 24 respectively.\n\nWe can now write a Python code to compute the total age."

This is the correct answer. \n\nLet's verify the solution to confirm:\n\nVerification:\n- each sister's age is 1.6 * 10 = 16 years old. Since there are 3 sisters, their total age is 16 * 3 = 48 years.\n- the younger brother's age is 20 * (3/5) = 12 years old.\n- the older brother's age, being double the age of the younger brother, is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n- Summing up all the ages, we have 48 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 84 years.\n\nThis confirms that the total age of all the siblings is \\boxed{84.0} years."
