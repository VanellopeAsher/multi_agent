Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost. If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, how much was the total cost?"

This formula represents a general relationship between the original cost and the amount Ethan spends when making the item himself.\n\nSo if Ethan saved 20% by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, the formula for the total cost would be:\n\n```python\ndef total_cost(x):\n    return 0.8 * x\n```\n\nReplace `x` with the original cost of the wallpaper to find the total amount Ethan spends.

Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef total_cost(x):\n    return 0.8 * x\n```\n\nYou can use this function by replacing `x` with the original cost of the wallpaper. Then you will get the total cost that Ethan spends, as he makes the wallpaper by himself and saves 20%. \n\nStill, until we know the value of `x`, we can't give you a numeric answer. \n\nIf you want to test the function, you can call it with an arbitrary value. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(total_cost(100))\n```\n\nThis will print out \"80.0\", which means if the original cost was 100, then Ethan would spend 80 after saving 20%."

If the original cost of the wallpaper was 100, Ethan would spend 80 (thus saving 20% of the cost) when making it on his own.\n\nAs a reminder, to get the total cost in your actual situation, simply replace 100 with your real original cost of the wallpaper in the function call `total_cost(100)`.\n\nFor example, if your original cost was 150, you'd calculate `total_cost(150)` to find how much Ethan would spend. If you have this information available, I can help compute it for you.\n\nBut based on the provided information and the calculation shown, Ethan would spend 80% of the original price if he makes the wallpaper by himself, saving 20%.
