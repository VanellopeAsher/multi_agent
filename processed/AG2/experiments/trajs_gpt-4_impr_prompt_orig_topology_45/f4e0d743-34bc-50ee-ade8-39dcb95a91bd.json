Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEvery month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. Additionally, Madeline also buys a special shampoo for her dog that costs $15 per month and a toy that costs $10 every two months. If there are 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year, how much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year?"

Compute the weekly food cost into monthly costs by multiplying it by the approximate number of weeks in a month.\n2. Calculate the total monthly expenses by summing up the monthly costs for food, treats, medicine, shampoo, one-half the cost of the toy (because it's purchased bi-monthly).\n3. Convert the total monthly expenses into an annual cost by multiplying it by the number of months in a year. \n\nWe'll use Python to implement this calculation. We'll use the sympy package to retain accuracy throughout the calculations."

This value represents the total amount of money that Madeline spends on her dog per year.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\nNow, let's verify each part of the calculation.\n\n1. Monthly cost of food = 4 weeks/month * $25/week = $100/month\n2. Total monthly costs = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) + $15 (shampoo) + $10/2 (toy) = $235/month\n3. Annual cost of expenses = 12 months/year * $235/month = $2820/year\n\nAfter verification, it seems there was a mistake in our calculations, the total should be $2820 instead of $2880. Let's do the calculations again to confirm this. \n\n```python\n# Define the costs\nfood_weekly = 25\ntreats_monthly = 20\nmedicine_monthly = 100\nshampoo_monthly = 15\ntoy_bi_monthly = 10\n\n# Compute the monthly cost of food\nfood_monthly = 4 * food_weekly\n\n# Sum all the monthly costs\ntotal_monthly_expenses = food_monthly + treats_monthly + medicine_monthly + shampoo_monthly + (toy_bi_monthly / 2)\n\n# Compute the total annual expenses\ntotal_annual_expenses = 12 * total_monthly_expenses\ntotal_annual_expenses\n```\n\nThis should give us the corrected total annual cost."
