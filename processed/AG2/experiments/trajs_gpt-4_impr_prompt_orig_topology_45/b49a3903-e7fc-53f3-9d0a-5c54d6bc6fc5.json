Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJackson is planting tulips in his garden. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips and decides to add a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips. If he can fit 5 yellow tulips in a row and he buys 30 yellow tulips, how many total rows of flowers will he plant?"

      "content": "Jackson can arrange the tulips into rows as follows:\n\n1. For red tulips, 36 tulips can be arranged in 36/6 = 6 rows.\n2. For blue tulips, 24 tulips can be arranged in 24/8 = 3 rows.\n3. For yellow tulips, 30 tulips can be arranged in 30/5 = 6 rows.\n\nHowever, the yellow tulips are intended to be placed between rows of red and blue tulips. One possibility is to place 1 row of yellow tulips after every row of red and blue tulips, saving 1 row for the transition between red and blue sections. This would distribute 6-2 = 4 rows of yellow tulips and leave 2 yellow rows to form the start and end of the garden. \n\nAnother possibility is to place 2 rows of yellow tulips between every 2 rows of red tulips and 1 row of yellow tulips between every row of blue tulips, which would utilize the extra row of yellow tulips.\n\nFinally, let's apply some Python code to calculate how many rows Jackson can plant in total."

The calculations are straightforward and involve only division, meaning errors are unlikely if using a computer. The problem does not specify otherwise, so the calculations match the requirements. The scenario proposed seems reasonable and fulfills the requirement of inserting yellow rows between red and blue ones. \n\nNow, let's run the Python code to find the total number of flower rows that Jackson can plant in his garden."
