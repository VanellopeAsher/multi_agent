Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

      "content": "Approach:\nWe'll start by calculating the total time spent on each activity. For swimming, John spent half the time he spent boating, which means he spent 6/2=3 hours swimming. He also watched 3 shows with each show lasting 2 hours, meaning a total of 3*2=6 hours watching shows. The problem indicates that this time spent on these activities accounted for 30% of his total time.\n\nWe'll solve for the total time using the equation (6 hours boating + 3 hours swimming + 6 hours watching shows)/ 0.3 = total_time. From the total time, weâ€™ll subtract the time spent on all other activities to determine the time spent sightseeing. \n\nLet's proceed with these computations."

Shows: 3*2 = 6 hours\nSumming these times gives us 15 hours. This represents 30% of the total time, as stated in the problem. Therefore, the total time John spent can be calculated as $15 hours/0.3 = 50 hours$.\n4. Finally, we calculate the time John spent sightseeing by subtracting the time spent on the other activities from the total time: $50 hours - 15 hours = 35 hours$.\nThis matches our result, so we can confidently say our answer is correct."
