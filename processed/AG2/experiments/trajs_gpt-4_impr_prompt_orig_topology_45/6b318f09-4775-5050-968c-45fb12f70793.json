Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMartha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 12 families with 6 people and 15 families with 4 people. 16 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?"

      "content": "From the problem, we can identify the following data:\n\n* 12 families with 6 people each got invited\n* 15 families with 4 people each got invited\n* 16 people couldn't make it due to illness\n* 1/4 of the people who couldn't make it due to illness, had prior commitments.\n\nOur task is to calculate the number of people who showed up to Martha's party, which is essentially the total invites minus those who were unable to attend.\n\nTo solve this problem, one could use simple mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), and some basic concepts such as fractions. Thus, let's solve it directly using Python.\n\nTo proceed with the calculations, we'll write Python code to:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people invited. \n2. Calculate the total number of people who couldn't show up due to illness or prior commitments. \n3. Subtract the total number of people who couldn't attend from the total invites to determine the number of people who attended. \n\n```python\n# Each family has a different number of people. 12 families each has 6 people while 15 families each has 4 people. The total number of invites is the sum of the products.\ntotal_invites = 12 * 6 + 15 * 4 \n\n# The number of people who couldn't attend the party is the sum of those who were sick and those who had prior commitments. \ntotal_absent = 16 + 16 / 4\n\n# The number of people who attended the party is the difference between the total number of people invited and those who couldn't attend\nattendance = total_invites - total_absent\n\nprint(int(attendance))\n```\n\nBy running this script, we can find the number of people in attendance at Martha's party."

      "content": "Great! Now let's verify the result in a step-by-step fashion.\n\nVerification:\n\n1. Total invites: 12 families with 6 members equals 72 invites. 15 families with 4 members equals 60 invites. The total number of invites (72 + 60) is indeed 132, which matches our calculation.\n\n2. Absentees: 16 people were sick, and 1/4 that number had prior commitments. So, 4 people had prior commitments. The total number of absentees (16 sick + 4 commitments) equals 20, which matches our calculation.\n\n3. Attendees: Based on our calculations, 132 people were invited, and 20 couldn't attend. This means - as we calculated earlier - 112 people attended the party.\n\nSo, the verification confirms the accuracy of our solution, and hence, the number of people who attended Martha's party is indeed 112.\n\nHence, the final answer is $\\boxed{112}$."
