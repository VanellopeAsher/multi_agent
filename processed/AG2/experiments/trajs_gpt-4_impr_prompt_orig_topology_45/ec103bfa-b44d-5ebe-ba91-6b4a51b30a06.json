Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $120, 5 packs of milk that costs $30 each, 40 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $900. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $57?"

      "content": "The number, 10, indeed makes sense since it is a round whole number. The calculation seems correct, but let's perform a quick manual check to ensure the validity of the result. We should calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, the milk packs, the apples, and the 10 pizza boxes. If the sum matches with the $900 that Marie paid, then the solution is correct. \n\nCalculating:\n- Chicken meal: 1 * $120 = $120\n- Milk packs: 5 * $30 = $150\n- Apples: 40 * $1.5 = $60\n- Pizzas: 10 * $57= $570\n\nSumming these results should give us $900. Let's check it out. \n\n$120 + $150 + $60 + $570 = $900\n\nIt indeed equals to $900, so the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, Marie ordered \\boxed{10} boxes of pizza."
