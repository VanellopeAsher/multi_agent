Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $10. After 10 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?"

      "content": "First, we find out how much Pauline spends in 10 years. Each year, she visits 3 times, and the cost of each visit is $10. So in one year, she spends 3 visits * $10 = $30. Over 10 years, this adds up to 10 years * $30/year = $300.\n\nNext, the problem tells us that the price for one visit increases by 150%. This makes the new price $10 + ($10 * 1.5) = $25. Pauline continues visiting for 3 additional years at this new rate. So for these years, she spends 3 years * 3 visits/year * $25/visit = $225.\n\nSo in total, Pauline spends $300 + $225 = $525.\n\nNow, let's implement this calculation in Python.\n\n```python\n# Constants for the problem\ninitial_price_per_visit = 10\ntimes_per_year = 3\ninitial_years = 10\nadditional_years = 3\nprice_increase_fraction = 1.50\n\n# Calculate total costs for initial years\ninitial_cost = initial_price_per_visit * times_per_year * initial_years\n\n# Calculate total costs for additional years\nnew_price_per_visit = initial_price_per_visit * (1 + price_increase_fraction)\nadditional_cost = new_price_per_visit * times_per_year * additional_years\n\n# Sum them up\ntotal_cost = initial_cost + additional_cost\n\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nNow let's run our verification steps."

Then for the next 3 years, with the increased price, she spends $225 (3 years * $75/year), which adds up to a total of $525 out of Pauline's pocket for 13 years of visiting the museum $300 + $225 = $525.\n\nSo, Pauline has spent \\boxed{525} dollars in total on visiting the museum."
