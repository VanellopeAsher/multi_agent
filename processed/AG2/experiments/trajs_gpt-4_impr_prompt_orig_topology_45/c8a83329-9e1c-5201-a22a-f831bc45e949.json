Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nErica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards. She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends. How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?"

She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family, and received 17 from her friends.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't specify how many cards were in each box of pre-made cards that her dad brought her."

Let's assume each box of cards contains a number 'x' of cards.\n\nThe initial number of Valentine's Day cards Erica had is:\n- The number of cards she made (20), plus\n- Two boxes of cards her father gave her (2 * x).\n\nThe final number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has after distributing some and receiving some is:\n- The initial number of cards, minus\n- The number of cards she gave to her classmates (24),\n- The number of cards she gave to her family (5),\n- Plus the number of cards she received (17).\n\nSo mathematically, the problem can be represented as the equation \"20 + 2x - 24 - 5 + 17\". We'll solve for 'x' using Python. However, remember that 'x' is unknown. Therefore, I will only calculate the result with respect to 'x'. If 'x' is provided, the equation will yield a real number."

Let's find its value.\n\nThe Python code for this would be:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbol 'x'\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# The expression for the number of cards Erica has\nexpression = 20 + 2*x - 24 - 5 + 17\n\n# Simplify the expression\nsimplified_expression = expression.simplify()\n\nsimplified_expression\n```\n\nThis would give us the simplified expression for the number of cards Erica has in terms of 'x'."
