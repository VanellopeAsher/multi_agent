Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nGeorge needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000.5. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500.5. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15.3 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?"

Determine the total cost for George's dental work by adding together the price of the two implants and the extra price for the porcelain crown.\n2. Subtract George's deposit to find out how much more he needs to pay.\n3. Divide the outstanding amount by George's hourly wage to determine how many hours he will need to work.\n\nWe can use Python for these calculations.\n\n```python\nimplant_price = 2000.5\ncrown_price = 500.5\ndeposit = 600\nhourly_wage = 15.3\n\n# total cost for dental work\ntotal_cost = 2 * implant_price + crown_price\n\n# amount needed after deposit\noutstanding_amount = total_cost - deposit\n\n# number of hours needed to work\nhours_needed = outstanding_amount / hourly_wage\nround(hours_needed,2)\n```"

      "content": "Based on the calculations, George needs to work approximately 255 hours in order to pay for his dental work.\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. George needs 2 implants, hence $2000.5 * 2 = $4001\n2. One implant will have porcelain crown that costs additional $500.5, therefore the total cost is $4001 + $500.5 = $4501.5\n3. After paying a deposit of $600, the remaining amount to be paid is $4501.5 - $600 = $3901.5\n4. Given that George's hourly wage is $15.3, the amount of hours he needs to work is $3901.5 / $15.3 ≈ 255 hours\n\nThis verifies that our solution is correct.\n\nFinal Answer: George needs to work approximately \boxed{255} hours to pay for the dental work."
