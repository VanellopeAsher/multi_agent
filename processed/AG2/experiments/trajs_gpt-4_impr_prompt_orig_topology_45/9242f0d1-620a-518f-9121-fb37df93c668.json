  "problem": "On her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories. Her generous family had gifted her a budget of €1500 for her birthday. She also had a plan to buy a new outfit with the remaining money. She visited a computer store and picked out a computer that cost €1090, which included a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also added a scanner priced at €157 to her cart, along with a CD burner worth €74. She spotted a printer for €102 and decided to get that too. On her way to the checkout, she saw a set of speakers for €200 and a gaming chair for €300. However, she decided not to buy them as they were not necessary for her needs. How much money will she have left to spend on her new outfit?",

Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOn her 30th birthday, Elvira decided to treat herself to a new computer setup, complete with accessories.

Simply put, it is a problem of subtraction. \n\nThe total amount of money Elvira had is €1500. She spent €1090 on a computer and additional €157 on a scanner, €74 on a CD burner, and €102 on a printer. The total money spent is thus 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102. We can subtract this total spent from the initial budget of €1500 she had to find out how much she has left. \n\nThere is no need to consider the price of the speakers and the gaming chair because she did not purchase them.\n\nLet's perform this calculation using Python.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the initial budget\ninitial_budget = 1500  \n\n# Initialize the cost of each item\ncomputer_cost = 1090  \nscanner_cost = 157  \nburner_cost = 74  \nprinter_cost = 102  \n\n# Calculate the total cost of the items purchased\ntotal_cost = computer_cost + scanner_cost + burner_cost + printer_cost  \n\n# Calculate the remaining budget\nremaining_budget = initial_budget - total_cost  \n\n# Print the remaining budget\nprint(remaining_budget)\n```"

After buying the computer, scanner, CD burner, and printer, Elvira will have €77 left to spend on her new outfit.\n\nLet's verify the solution:\n\n1. Initial budget: €1500\n2. Total spent (Computer: €1090, Scanner: €157, CD Burner: €74, Printer: €102): €1423\n3.
