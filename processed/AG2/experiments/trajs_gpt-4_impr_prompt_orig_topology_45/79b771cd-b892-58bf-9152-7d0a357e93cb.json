Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: Step-by-Step Process. \n\n1. The problem specifies that Polly can throw the gold javelin 3 times farther when holding the gemstone. Therefore one needs to find the new range of the javelin when Polly holds the gemstone. \n\n2. Subtract the dragon's flame range from the new javelin throw range. This will provide the distance from which Polly can safely throw the javelin and hit the dragon. \n\n3. The result will be a numerical value in feet representing the safe distance from the dragon's flames. \n\nLet's go ahead to compute the above steps:\n\n1. The new distance that Polly can throw the javelin is 3 times her normal distance, i.e., `3 * 4000` feet.\n\n2. Consequently, Polly's safe distance from the dragon's flames is the new throwing distance minus the dragon's flame range, i.e., `new_throw_range - 10000`. \n\nWe can proceed to calculate these values using Python."

      "content": "Verification:\n1. Check the numbers in the given problem. The initial distance Polly can throw the javelin is 4000 feet, the dragon's flame range is 10000 feet, and the gemstone increases Polly's throwing distance by 3 times.\n2. Check the calculations. The new throwing distance was calculated correctly as `3 * 4000 = 12000` feet. The safe distance has also been calculated correctly as `12000 - 10000 = 2000` feet.\n3. Make sure the answer makes sense. Polly needs to be outside of the dragon's 10000 feet fire range to avoid getting burned, so a positive number for the safe distance is expected. A distance of 2000 feet allows Polly to be outside the fire range and still able to hit the dragon with the javelin. \n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{2000}."
