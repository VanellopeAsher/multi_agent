Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help?

Here's how we'll solve it:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. \n\n- March has 31 days. So, from March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days. \n- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. \n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of working days. \n\n- Subtract the number of days taken off (which is 20% of total days) from the total number of days. \n\nStep 3: Multiply the number of daily tax service instances by the total number of working days to get the total tax service instances.\n\nLet's start with the Step 1 computations.\n\n```python\n# Total days from March 1st to April 19th\ntotal_days_march_april = 31 + 19\ntotal_days_march_april\n```"

We have found that there are 50 days between March 1st and April 19th.\n2. Billy works 80% of these days, which is 40 days.\n3. Each day, Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours, which is 7 people.\n4.
