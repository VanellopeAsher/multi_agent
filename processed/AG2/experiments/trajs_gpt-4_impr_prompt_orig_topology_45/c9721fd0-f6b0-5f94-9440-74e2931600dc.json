Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nPatty's Plumbing has a service fee of $40 for a house call, in addition to $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on labor, as well as the cost of parts. If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?"

Labor cost, which is $35 for each hour or fraction of an hour. In this case, as it's 2.25 hours. So, we will treat 0.25 hours as another full hour and as a result, Patty spent a total of 3 hours.\n3. Additionally, the cost of parts worth $60\n\nNext, we will sum up all these elements to arrive at the total amount billed by Patty. Note that decimals will represent cents.\n\n```python\n# Calculation\nservice_fee = 40\nhourly_rate = 35\nhours_worked = 2.25\nparts_cost = 60\n\n# Since time spent is counted as another full hour if its fraction\ntotal_hours = int(hours_worked) if hours_worked.is_integer() else int(hours_worked) + 1\n\n# Calculate the total labor cost\nlabor_cost = total_hours * hourly_rate\n\n# Total amount\ntotal_amount = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\ntotal_amount\n```\n\nThe result of the total_amount is the total amount billed by Patty."

      "content": "Verification:\n\nLet's break down the calculated total_amount to check if it includes all the required components correctly.\n\n- The service fee for the house call is $40 which is included in the total amount.\n\n- Patty worked for 2.25 hours. Given that any fraction of an hour is treated as a full hour, Patty billed for 3 hours. The labor cost at a rate of $35 per hour for 3 hours is 3 * $35 = $105. This is included in the total amount.\n\n- The cost of parts worth $60 is included in the total amount.\n\nSo out total amount should be $40 (service fee) + $105 (labor cost) + $60 (parts) = $205\n\nConcluding, the total billed amount by Patty correctly adds up to $205.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe total amount billed by Patty was $205.\n\nWe write this as: \\boxed{205}."
