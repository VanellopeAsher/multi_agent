Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJohn goes shopping and buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items, and he also decides to buy a pack of cookies for 2 dollars and a bottle of water for 1 dollar, how much did everything cost?

The food items have no tax applied to them, while the nonfood items do.\n\n- Food items: milk, eggs, cookies, bottle of water (2+3+2+1 = 8 dollars, no tax)\n- Nonfood items: light bulbs, cups, roach traps (3+3+4 = 10 dollars, with tax)\n\nTo calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of the food items to the cost of the nonfood items after tax is applied. The given tax rate is 10%. \n\n```python\n# Python code implementing the explanation\n\n# define cost of food and nonfood items\nfood_cost = 2 + 3 + 2 + 1\nnonfood_cost = 3 + 3 + 4\n\n# calculate tax on nonfood items\ntax = 0.10 * nonfood_cost\n\n# calculate total cost\ntotal_cost = food_cost + nonfood_cost + tax\ntotal_cost\n```\nYou can run this code in Python to get the final total cost."

Recalculating the costs for food items: milk(2) + eggs(3) + cookies(2) + water(1) = 8 dollars\n2. Recalculating costs for non-food items: light bulbs(3), cups(3), roach traps(4) = 10 dollars\n3. 10% of non-food items = 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar in tax\n4. Adding up the cost of taxed and untaxed items: 8 (for food) + 10 (for non-food) + 1 (tax on non-food items) = 19 dollars\n\nThe sum is indeed 19 dollars.
