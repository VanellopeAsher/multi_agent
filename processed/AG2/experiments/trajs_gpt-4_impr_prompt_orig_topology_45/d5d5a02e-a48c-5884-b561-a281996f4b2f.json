Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nEmil is 21 years old now. When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved using simple math formulas. \n\nStep 1: Let's denote Emil's dad's current age as D and Emil's brother's current age as B.\n\nStep 2: The problem statement tells us that when Emil is 26 his dad will be twice his age, so D + 5 = 2 * 26. Using this equation we can find the value of D.\n\nStep 3: Similarly, when Emil is 26, he will be twice as old as his brother, so B + 5 = 26 / 2. From this equation, we can find the value of B.\n\nStep 4: Once we have the values of B and D, their sum will give us the desired answer.\n\nLet's calculate this in python:\n\n```python\n# importing sympy module for solving equations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# initializing symbols\nD, B = symbols('D B')\n\n# equation based on the problem\neq1 = Eq(D + 5, 2 * 26)\neq2 = Eq(B + 5, 26 / 2)\n\n# solving equations\ndad_age = solve(eq1, D)[0]\nbrother_age = solve(eq2, B)[0]\n\n# calculating the sum of the ages\nage_sum = dad_age + brother_age\n\nprint(age_sum)\n```\n\nThis program will output the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother."

When he turns 26, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.”\n\n- Emil will turn 26 in 5 years.\n- By then, his dad will be twice his age, which means his dad will be 52 years old. So, his current age will be 52 - 5 = 47 years old.\n- Also by then, Emil will be twice the age of his brother, which means his brother will be 13 years old. So, his current age will be 13 - 5 = 8 years old.\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 47 + 8 = 55, which aligns with our computed result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 55.\n\nSo, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \\boxed{55}."
