Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nSean is practicing for his role in a theater production.

      "content": "Firstly, we'll calculate the number of lines in each part that Sean needs to memorize.\n\nThe number of lines that Sean needs to memorize for the solo song is given to be 54.\n\nFor the first scene, the number of lines in total is double the number of lines in the song. That means there are 54 * 2 = 108 lines in total. However, only a third of them are Sean's lines. So, the lines that Sean needs to memorize for the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.\n\nFor the second scene, the number of lines in total is six more than the song, which means there are 54 + 6 = 60 lines in total. Among them, four-fifths are Sean's lines. So, the lines that Sean needs to memorize for the second scene is 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.\n\nHowever, there are additional 15 lines that the other actor can't memorize and Sean needs to cover those as well.\n\nSteps to Solve:\n1. Calculate the number of lines Sean needs to memorize for the solo song.\n2. Calculate the number of lines Sean needs to memorize for the first scene.\n3. Calculate the number of lines Sean needs to memorize for the second scene.\n4. Add the additional 15 lines that Sean needs to cover.\n5. Sum all of these lines.\n\nLet's code these steps to get the solution.\n\n```python\n# number of lines in song\nlines_song = 54\n\n# number of lines in first scene\nlines_scene_1 = lines_song * 2 / 3\n\n# number of lines in second scene\nlines_scene_2 = (lines_song + 6) * 4 / 5\n\n# additional lines\nadditional_lines = 15\n\n# total lines that Sean needs to memorize\ntotal_lines = lines_song + lines_scene_1 + lines_scene_2 + additional_lines\n\ntotal_lines\n```\nAfter running this Python code, we'll plug in the value returned by total_lines for final verification."
