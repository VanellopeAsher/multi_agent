Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female. If there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland, how many are left in the world?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved by the reasoning process, without needing code.\n\nFirst of all, the problem states that there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland and that these unicorns are two-thirds of unicorns in Scotland. We can use simple algebra to solve for the total number of unicorns in Scotland:\n\nLet U represent the number of unicorns in Scotland. \nTwo-thirds (2/3) of U equals 6.\n\nSo, 2/3 * U = 6\n\nWe can solve for U (the total number of unicorns in Scotland) and multiply our answer by 3 to get the total number of unicorns worldwide (because 1/3 of all unicorns are in Scotland).\n\nLet's go step by step."

Given that this is a third of the total number of unicorns in the world, to find the total number of unicorn worldwide, let's multiply this number by 3:\n\nTotal number of unicorns = 9 * 3 = 27.\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\nLet's verify this answer through the verification steps:\n\n1. We start with 6 female unicorns in Scotland, which are said to be two-thirds of all unicorns in Scotland. This means the total number of unicorns in Scotland should be 9 (6 / (2/3)), which checks out.\n2. The problem then says that this number in Scotland is 1/3 of all unicorns in the world. That would indeed make the total worldwide unicorn population 27 (9 * 3), which also checks out.\n\nThere are 27 unicorns in total across the world."
