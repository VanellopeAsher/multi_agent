Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nA trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. Each bag of wheat weighs 60 pounds. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?"

      "content": "Here is how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. We know the trader bought and sold each bag of wheat at a cost difference of $10 (buying price: $20, selling price: $30).\n\n2. However, it also cost the trader an additional $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse. This means that his net profit from each bag of wheat was $8 ($10 sale profit minus $2 transportation cost).\n\n3. Given that the total profit made by the trader was $400, we can divide this amount by the net profit from each bag to calculate how many bags the trader must have sold.\n\n4. Expressing this calculation in Python, we get the following:\n\n```python\ntotal_profit = 400\nnet_profit_per_bag = 8\nnumber_of_bags_sold = total_profit / net_profit_per_bag\n```\n\nLet's run this calculation and display the output."
