      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTwenty kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each.

      "content": "This is a problem that can be solved using Python in a direct manner.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many boys and girls went on the trip. From the problem statement, we know that there are 20 kids in total divided equally into boys and girls.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of seashells collected by the boys. Every boy brought 60 seashells.\n\nLastly, to find the amount brought back by the girls, we use the information given in the problem statement. The girls brought back a quantity of seashells equal to the number the boys brought plus 4.5 times the amount the boys brought.\n\nNow let's code this.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the variables\ntotal_kids = 20 \nseashells_by_boy = 60 \n\n# Calculate the number of boys and girls\nboys = girls = total_kids / 2 \n\n# Calculate the seashells collected by the boys\ntotal_seashells_by_boys = boys * seashells_by_boy \n\n# Calculate the seashells collected by the girls\nseashells_by_girl = total_seashells_by_boys + 4.5 * total_seashells_by_boys\n\n# Average number of seashells collected by each girl\naverage_seashells_by_girl = seashells_by_girl / girls\n\nprint(average_seashells_by_girl)\n```\nYou can calculate it using this code."
