Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nTim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. However, on Fridays, he spends an additional 2 hours at work due to high call volumes. How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week, considering the extra hours on Friday?"

We are given that he works 6 hours each day. However, on Fridays, he works an extra 2 hours. \n\nLet's calculate the number of calls he can answer from Monday to Thursday first and then add it to the number of calls he answers on Friday. Let's formulate the python code for this.\n\n```python\n# Normal working hours in a day\nnormal_work_hours = 6\n\n# Time spent per call in minutes\ntime_per_call = 15\n\n# Extra hours on Friday\nextra_hours_on_friday = 2 \n\n# Convert time per call to hours\ntime_per_call_in_hours = time_per_call / 60\n\n# Calculate how many calls Tim answers in an hour\ncalls_per_hour = 1 / time_per_call_in_hours\n\n# Calculate how many calls Tim answers in a normal workday\ncalls_per_day = normal_work_hours * calls_per_hour\n\n# Calculate how many calls Tim answers on Friday (with extra hours)\ncalls_on_friday = (normal_work_hours + extra_hours_on_friday) * calls_per_hour\n\n# Calculate how many calls Tim can answer in a five-day work week\ntotal_calls_per_week = 4 * calls_per_day + calls_on_friday\n\nprint(total_calls_per_week)\n```\nLet me know the result you get from running the python code."
