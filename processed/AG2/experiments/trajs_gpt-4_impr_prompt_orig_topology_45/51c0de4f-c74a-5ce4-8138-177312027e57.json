Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nWalter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.

Walter's lawyer contributes three times the sum of the above two amounts.\n4. His friend gives him an unknown amount which we need to find.\n\nWe know as well that the total amount Walter received is $6600.\n\nLet's illustrate this with an equation:\n\nNeighbor contribution (N) = $500\nOnline fund contribution (O) = $1500\nLawyer contribution (L) = 3 * (N + O)\nFriend contribution (F) = unknown\n\nThe total contribution (T) = N + O + L + F = $6600\n\nWe can now write the equation for the total contribution and solve it for F:\n\n(N + O + L + F) = $6600. F can therefore be calculated as T - N - O - L.  Let's solve this equation using python."

Let's update our equation accordingly and solve it again.\n\nHere's our equation - which we'll solve using sympy:\n\nL = 3 * (N + O + F)\n\nWhere: \nL equals Lawyer's contribution, which is $6600\nN equals Neighbors' contribution, which is $500\nO equals the Online fund's contribution, which is $1500\nF equals the Friend's contribution, which we are looking to determine.\n\nSince we now know L, N, and O, we can substitute these values into the equation and solve it for F.\n\nLet's do that using the sympy package in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nF = symbols('F')\neq = Eq(L, 3 * (N + O + F))\nsolution = solve(eq, F)\n\nprint(\"Friend's Contribution: \", solution[0])\n```\n\nNow, let's run this code and observe the output."
