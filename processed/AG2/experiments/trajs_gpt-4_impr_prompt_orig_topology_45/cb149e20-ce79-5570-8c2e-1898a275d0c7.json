Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nJayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera. Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera after the allowance and the money from selling picture. How much is the camera?"

So, all we need to do is calculate how much money Jayden has and then add the remaining $85 he needs to purchase the camera.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these calculations:\n\n```python\n# initial amount Jayden has\nJayden_money = 70\n\n# Ava gives half of her $90 allowance\nAva_money = 90 / 2\n\n# He needs $85 more\nneeded_money = 85\n\n# Total cost of the camera\ntotal_camera_cost = Jayden_money + Ava_money + needed_money\n\n# print the cost of the camera\nprint(total_camera_cost)\n```\nThe solution will calculate and print the total cost of the camera."

      "content": "Sure, indeed the \"print\" function in the Python code displays the total, but it does indeed make an output of a floating point number. The value inside the box $$\\boxed{200.0}$$ should be in an integer format. Letâ€™s replace it with $$\\boxed{200}$$ which is the correct format for this solution.\n\nJust for clarification, here are the details of the calculations:\n\n1. Jayden initially had $70.\n2. Ava gave him $45 (which is half of her $90 allowance).\n3. Jayden still needed an additional $85.\n\nSo, when we add all these amounts together, we get the total cost of the camera:\n $$70 + 45 + 85 = 200$$\n\nTherefore, the camera Jayden wants to buy costs $200."
