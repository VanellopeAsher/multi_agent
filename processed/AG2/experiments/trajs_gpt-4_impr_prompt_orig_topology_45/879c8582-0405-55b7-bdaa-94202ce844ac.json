Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?"

      "content": "This problem can be solved directly using Python's math capabilities. \n\nThe main conceptual understanding required will be the calculation of the total number of cards Miss Maria has (considering all her collections), how many are left after she retains 50 cards for herself, and finally how many students she has, given that each student receives 10 cards. \n\nWe can proceed using the following steps: \n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. \n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has. \n3. Sum the basketball cards, baseball cards, and soccer cards to find the total number of cards. \n4. Subtract the 50 cards that Miss Maria keeps to find the number of cards distributed to students. \n5. Finally, divide the number of distributed cards by the number of cards per student (10) to find the total number of students.\n\nThe solution will look as follows:\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of basketball cards.\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards.\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards.\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards + 30\n# Step 4: Calculate the number of cards distributed to students.\ndistributed_cards = total_cards - 50\n# Step 5: Calculate the number of students.\nstudents = distributed_cards // 10\n\nprint(students)\n```\n\nLet's execute this calculation."

      "content": "Given the code provided above, the number of students Miss Maria has, given that each student receives 10 cards each, is 33 students. The solution has been calculated correctly.\n\nVERIFICATION: \nMiss Maria has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, a total of 6*25 = 150 basketball cards. \nShe has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, a total of 5*40 = 200 baseball cards. \nShe also has a special collection of 30 rare soccer cards. \nSo, in total, she has 150 + 200 + 30 = 380 sports cards. \nShe keeps 50 cards for herself, which leaves 380 - 50 = 330 cards for distribution to her students.\nAs each student gets 10 cards, the number of students is 330 / 10 = 33.\n\nSo, she has 33 students. This aligns with the value computed from the Python operation, which increases our confidence in the accuracy of the result.\n\nThe number of students that Miss Maria has is 33.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 33, so we return âŽ•33."
