Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nCecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar.

Gallon jar cost: $5.5 \n    Subtracting the \"extra\" cost difference, the half-gallon jar, therefore, costs indeed $3.00, which matches the calculation obtain.\n2. The overall amount spent is computed by multiplying the quantity of each jar by their respective costs and summing these two amounts:\n - Ten gallon jars at $5.5 each sums to $55.00\n - Sixteen half-gallon jars at $3.00 each sums to $48.00\nAdding these amounts confirms the total spend to be $103.00, a value also reflected in the computed result. \n\nSo, the values are indeed correct. Hence, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.00 and the total amount Cecelia spent on ten gallon jars and sixteen half-gallon jars is $103.00. \n\nYour final answer is given in the format \boxed{3}, $3.0 for the cost of a half-gallon jar and \boxed{103}, $103.0 for the total amount spent on jars."
