Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nOctavia has made a quilt for her sister using small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with.

      "content": "Problem-Solving Approach: Direct Python Solution\n\nLet's start by calculating the total area of the medium and large shirts and subtract that from the total area of the quilt. This will give us the area of the small shirts. Since we know that each small shirt is 3 square feet, we can then divide the area of small shirts by 3 to get the number of small shirts. \n\n```python\n# number of medium and large shirts\nmedium_shirts = 8\nlarge_shirts = 6\n\n# area of each type of shirt\nsmall_shirt_area = 3\nmedium_shirt_area = 4\nlarge_shirt_area = 6\n\n# total quilt area\ntotal_quilt_area = 101\n\n# area of medium and large shirts\nmedium_large_area = (medium_shirts * medium_shirt_area) + (large_shirts * large_shirt_area)\n\n# area of small shirts\nsmall_shirt_area_total = total_quilt_area - medium_large_area\n\n# number of small shirts\nsmall_shirts = small_shirt_area_total // small_shirt_area\nprint(small_shirts)\n```\n\nThis program should output the number of small shirts used."

Check if the Python solution is calculated correctly: \nMedium shirts' total area = 8 shirts * 4 sq. ft. per shirt = 32 sq. ft.\nLarge shirts' total area = 6 shirts * 6 sq. ft. per shirt = 36 sq. ft.\nTotal area covered by medium and large shirts = 32 sq. ft. + 36 sq. ft. = 68 sq. ft.\nTotal area to be covered by small shirts = Total area of the quilt - Area covered by medium and large shirts = 101 sq. ft. - 68 sq. ft. = 33 sq. ft.\nNumber of small shirts used = Total area to be covered by small shirts / Area per small shirt = 33 sq. ft. / 3 sq. ft. per shirt = 11 shirts.\n\nAfter following the Python solution, I can say that it is correct.\n\nThe final result is that Octavia used 11 small shirts to make the quilt.\n\nSo, the final answer is \u001b[boxed{11} shirts."
