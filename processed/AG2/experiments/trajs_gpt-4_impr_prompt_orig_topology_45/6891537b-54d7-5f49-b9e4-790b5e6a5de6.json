Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMiss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards.

      "content": "The first step is to calculate the total number of cards that Miss Maria will have after Jane refuses to take 10 cards. The total number of cards Miss Maria initially has is equal to the total number of basketball cards (6 decks * 25 cards/deck) plus the total number of baseball cards (5 boxes * 40 cards/box). After Jane gets 50 cards, the remaining number of cards will be divided among the students (10 cards per student).\nBelow is a Python program that calculates the number of students:\n\n```python\n# total number of basketball cards:\nbasketball_cards = 6 * 25 \n\n# total number of baseball cards:\nbaseball_cards = 5 * 40 \n\n# Total cards\ntotal_cards = basketball_cards + baseball_cards \n\n# Cards left after Jane takes her 50:\ncards_left = total_cards - 50 \n\n# Number of students that Miss Maria has:\nno_of_students = cards_left // 10 \n\nprint(no_of_students)\n```\n\nThe operator '//' is used to perform floor division. It rounds the result down to the nearest whole number. This is used because you cannot have a fraction of a student."

      "content": "Great! So upon running the calculation, you've found that Miss Maria has 30 students, as it's indeed the case that these many students would exactly receive 10 cards each.\n\nNow, let's perform a quick verification:\n\nTotal cards Miss Maria had:\n  Basketball cards: 6 decks * 25/deck = 150 cards\n  Baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40/box = 200 cards\n  Total = 150 + 200 = 350 cards\n\nAfter Jane kept 50 cards: 350 - 50 = 300 cards\n\nNow, if each student gets 10 cards: 300 cards / 10 cards = 30 students\n\nSo, the calculated number of students matches this verification and implies that the solution is correct.\n\nHence, the final verified answer is Miss Maria has \\boxed{30} students."
