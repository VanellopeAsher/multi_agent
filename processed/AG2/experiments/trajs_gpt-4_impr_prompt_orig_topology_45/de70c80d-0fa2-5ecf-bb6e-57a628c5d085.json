      "content": "\n    \nLet's use Python to tackle a math problem effectively.\n\nQuery Requirements:\n1. Output Format: Always utilize the print function for displaying results. Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nElise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full three times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?"

      "content": "Approach:\nWe know that the English alphabet contains 26 letters. Given Elise writes it first 3 times in full, she already writes 3 * 26 letters. After that, she writes half of the alphabet which is 26/2 = 13 letters more. Then, she writes everything she has already written. Therefore, we should add up the letters written in the first three full writings and the half writing to find out the total letters Elise has written until now and then multiply it by 2 (because she rewrote everything) to find the grand total.\n\nSolution:\nLet's calculate this using Python for an accurate result.\n\n```python\n# Calculate number of letters Elise has written\nalphabet_letters = 26\nfull_writings = 3\nhalf_writing = 1\n\n# Total letters before rewrite\ntotal_before_rewrite = (full_writings * alphabet_letters) + (half_writing * (alphabet_letters / 2))\n\n# Elise rewrites everything, so the total is doubled\ngrand_total = total_before_rewrite * 2\n\nprint(grand_total)\n```\nFinally, we can verify our solution. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and Elise writes it fully three times and half once, then rewrites everything she has already written, the calculated total should be accurate."
