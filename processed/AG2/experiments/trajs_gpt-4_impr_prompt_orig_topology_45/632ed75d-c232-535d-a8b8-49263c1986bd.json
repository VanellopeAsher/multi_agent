Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nThere are two aircraft at an airport that operate several flights daily.

      "content": "The problem can be solved by first figuring out the total number of flights made by the first aircraft based on the provided information about the second aircraft's flights and their correlation to the flights made by the first aircraft.

      "content": "Okay, let's continue to verify the solution by outling the steps below:\n\nVERIFICATION:\n\n1. We began by determining the total number of flights made by the first aircraft in one day. This number was computed as twice the amount of flights made by the second aircraft, as per the given problem. This gave us 88 flights in total.\n   \n2. Next, we calculated the number of flights made by the first aircraft to Greece. According to the problem, that's three-fourths of the total flights, which gives us 66 flights.\n   \n3. We then subtracted the number of flights to Greece from the total number of flights to find the number of flights to both France and Germany, which resulted in 22 flights.\n   \n4. Finally, we found the number of daily flights to France by dividing this value in half. This gave us 11 flights in total.\n\nTherefore, following the verification process, we can conclude that the first aircraft makes \\boxed{11} flights to France every day."
