Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nKatarina has 5 less cookies than Max has.

We'll then figure out the total number of cookies.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, Eq\n\n#  define symbols\nK, M, C, S, T = symbols('K M C S T')\n\n#  given conditions\nK = 6.8 * 10  # Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies \n\nM = solve(Eq(M, K + 5), M)[0] # Max's cookies\nC = solve(Eq(M, 1.2*(C + 10)), C)[0] # Cookie Monster's cookies\nS = M + 23  # Summer's cookies\n\nT = K + M + S + C  # total cookies\nprint(T)\n```\n\nDepending on the output obtained, we'll proceed to the verification step."

Now let's verify the outputs by following the steps below:\n\n- Check if the calculations were completed without errors.\n- The values for Max, Cookie Monster, and Summer were computed correctly using the given conditions.\n- Ensure that the total number of cookies (T = K + M + S + C) was calculated appropriately.\n\nLet's calculate the number of cookies each one has separately to confirm.\n\n```python\nprint(f\" Max has : {M}\")\nprint(f\" Katarina has : {K}\")\nprint(f\" The Cookie Monster has : {C}\")\nprint(f\" Summer has : {S}\")\n```\n\nThe outputs of these print statements will provide the number of cookies each individual has.

Max has 1.2 times of ten more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max - 1.2*(Cookie Monster + 10) = 73 - 1.2 * (50.83 + 10) = 0, confirms the second condition.\n3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, So Summer - Max = 96 - 73 = 23, confirms the third condition.\n4. Katarina has 6.8 times of ten cookies, Katarina = 6.8*10 = 68, verifies the fourth condition.\n\nSo all our major steps are correct. Now let's perform the final verification step:\n\nCalculate the total amount of cookies they have by adding these up, T = 73 + 68 + 50.83 + 96 = 287.83\n\nYep, this confirms our previous calculation of the total amount of cookies. \n\nSo, our final answer, the total number of cookies they all have, is \\boxed{287.83}."
