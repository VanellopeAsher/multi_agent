Use fractions or radical forms instead of decimal numbers.\n2. Libraries: You are encouraged to use packages such as sympy to facilitate calculations.\n\nCode Formatting:\nPlease adhere to the following format when writing your code:\n```python\n# your code\n```\n\nProblem-Solving Approach:\nFirst, articulate the key idea or concept necessary to solve the problem. You can choose from the following three approaches:\nCase 1: Direct Python Solution. If the problem can be solved directly using Python code, write a program to solve it. Feel free to enumerate all possible arrangements if necessary.\nCase 2: Reasoning-Based Solution. If the problem primarily involves reasoning, solve it directly without coding.\nCase 3: Step-by-Step Process. If the problem cannot be addressed using the above methods, follow this structured approach:\n1. Break down the problem into manageable steps (avoid excessive granularity).\n2. Identify any queries that can be computed using Python (e.g., calculations or equations).\n3. Await my input for any results obtained.\n4. If the results are valid and expected, proceed with your solution. If not, revise your query or reasoning accordingly.\n\nHandling Missing Data:\nIf a problem is deemed unsolvable due to missing data, return \boxed{'None'}. \nEnsure that only numerical values are placed inside the \boxed{}; any accompanying words should be outside.\n\nVerification Steps:\nBefore presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps:\n1. Take a moment to breathe deeply and ensure clarity of thought.\n2. Verify your solution step by step, documenting each part of the verification process in a designated VERIFICATION section.\n3. Once you are confident in your verification and certain of your answer, present your final result in the format \boxed{_you_answer_}, ensuring only numbers are inside.\n\nProblem Statement: \nMeredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.

      "content": "This problem involves finding the ratio of the number of articles written on Wednesday to the number of articles written on Tuesday. To do this, we'll first need to determine the number of articles written on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:\n\n**Step 1:** Find the total number of hours spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday. We know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 more on Tuesday. Each article takes 4 hours to write. So, we can calculate this with Python.\n\n**Step 2:** Subtract the total hours spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday (found in Step 1) from the total hours spent writing articles in the three days (104 hours). This should give us the total hours spent writing articles on Wednesday.\n\n**Step 3:** Divide the total hours spent writing articles on Wednesday (found in Step 2) by the number of hours it takes to write one article (4 hours). This will give us the number of articles written on Wednesday.\n\n**Step 4:** Divide the number of articles written on Wednesday (found in Step 3) by the number of articles written on Tuesday. \n\nLet's begin.\n\nStep 1: Find the total hours spent writing on Monday and Tuesday:\n```python\n# Amount of blogs written on Monday\nmonday_blogs = 5\n\n# Amount of blogs written on Tuesday is 2/5 more than Monday\ntuesday_blogs = monday_blogs + (2/5 * monday_blogs)\n\n# Total hours spent in writing blogs Monday and Tuesday given each blog takes 4 hours\ntotal_hours_mon_tue = (monday_blogs + tuesday_blogs) * 4\n```\nNow we need to calculate `total_hours_mon_tue`, the total amount of hours spent writing on Monday and Tuesday."

      "content": "Great, this is the final result.\n\nVerification Steps:\n1. Meredith wrote 5 blogs on Monday which took 20 hours (4 hours per blog).\n2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more blogs than on Monday which is 7 blogs or 28 hours in total.\n3. The total hours she used on Monday and Tuesday is thus 20+28 = 48 hours.\n4. It is given that the total hours for the three days is 104 hours. So, the hours she used on Wednesday is 104 - 48 = 56 hours. This implies she wrote 56/4 = 14 blogs on Wednesday.\n5. Comparing Wednesday to Tuesday, she wrote 14/7 = 2 times as many blogs.\n\nSince all the steps check out, we can conclude that:\n\nMeredith wrote 2 times as many articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday. So, the answer is: \n\n\\boxed{2}"
