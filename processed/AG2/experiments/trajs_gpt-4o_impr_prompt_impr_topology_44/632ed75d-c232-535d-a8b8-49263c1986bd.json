The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights, and the rest of its flights are evenly divided between France and Germany. The second aircraft only flies to Poland, and its 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft each day.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we'll determine the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France using the given information.\n\n1. Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first aircraft each day as \\( x \\).\n\n2. According to the problem, the second aircraft makes 44 flights to Poland, and these 44 flights represent half of the total flights made by the first aircraft. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} = 44\n   \\]\n\n3. Solving for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 44 \\times 2 = 88\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total number of flights made by the first aircraft each day is 88.\n\n4. The first aircraft flies to Greece for three-fourths of its total flights:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flights to Greece} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 66\n   \\]\n\n5. The remaining flights are split evenly between France and Germany. Since the total number of flights by the first aircraft is 88 and 66 flights are to Greece:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining Flights} = 88 - 66 = 22\n   \\]\n\n6. These 22 flights are divided evenly between France and Germany, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flights to France} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of daily flights made by the first aircraft to France is 11."
