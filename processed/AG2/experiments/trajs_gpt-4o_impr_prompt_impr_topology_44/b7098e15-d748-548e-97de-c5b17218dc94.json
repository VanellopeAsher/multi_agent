If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days, how many people does he help? After helping people, Billy also decides to take a 15-minute break every hour to drink a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine. He also spends 30 minutes each day to organize his paperwork.  (Remember there are 31 days in March.)",

      "content": "To determine how many people Billy helps, we will proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Number of Days Between March 1st and April 19th:**\n\n    - March has 31 days.\n    - April 19th is 19 days into April.\n    - Total days from March 1st to April 19th: \\(31 + 19 = 50\\) days.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days Billy Takes Off:**\n\n    - Billy takes 20% of the days off. Calculate 20% of 50 days:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Days off} = 50 \\times 0.20 = 10 \\text{ days}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Billy Works:**\n\n    - Subtract the days off from the total number of days:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Working days} = 50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ days}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of People Billy Helps Daily:**\n\n    - Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours each day:\n    \\[\n    \\text{People helped per day} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ people/day}\n    \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of People Helped:**\n\n    - Multiply the number of people helped per day by the number of working days:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Total people helped} = 6 \\times 40 = 240 \\text{ people}\n    \\]\n\nThus, Billy helps a total of 240 people during his volunteering period. \n\n**Note:** Information about breaks and caffeine intake is not relevant to the calculation of the number of people helped, so it's not factored into these computations."
