Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon and still successfully hit it with the javelin. \n\nHere’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Range of the Javelin:**\n   - Normally, Polly can throw the javelin 4000 feet.\n   - With the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.\n\n2. **Calculate the Enhanced Range with the Gemstone:**\n   - Three times 4000 feet is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Safe Standing Distance:**\n   - The dragon's reach (by breathing fire) is 10000 feet.\n   - To determine how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand while having the ability to hit it with the javelin, we subtract the dragon’s range from Polly’s enhanced range with the gemstone:\n   \\[\n   12000 - 10000 = 2000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Polly can stand 2000 feet outside of the dragon's flame reach and still hit the dragon with the javelin. This means she can safely stand 12000 feet from the dragon since the javelin’s reach is that far, while the dragon’s fire extends only up to 10000 feet. \n\n**Solution:** Polly can stand 2000 feet beyond the dragon's range safely, which situates her at 12000 feet from the dragon."

Polly can throw the javelin 4,000 feet without the gemstone.\n2. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, calculated as:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4000 \\text{ feet} = 12,000 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. The dragon's fire has a range of 10,000 feet.\n4.
