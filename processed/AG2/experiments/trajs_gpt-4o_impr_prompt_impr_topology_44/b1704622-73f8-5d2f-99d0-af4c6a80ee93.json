In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve the problem of finding the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the hours worked each day**:\n   - **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.\n   - **Wednesday**: He works double the hours of Tuesday. Thus, hours worked on Wednesday = \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) hours.\n   - **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than he worked on Wednesday. Therefore, hours worked on Thursday = \\( 10 - 2 = 8 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the total hours worked over the three days**:\n   - Total Hours = Hours on Tuesday + Hours on Wednesday + Hours on Thursday\n   - Total Hours = \\( 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \\) hours\n\nThus, Bruce worked a total of 23 hours over the three days."

On Thursday, Bruce worked 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday, so he worked \\( 10 - 2 = 8 \\) hours.\n\nThe total hours Bruce worked over the three days is therefore:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \\text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \\text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe Agent Problem Solver's solution seems logical and aligns with the information presented in the problem. Since no solution is provided by Agent Code Executor for cross-verification, and without any assumptions being made here, I will confirm this solution.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{23}**"
