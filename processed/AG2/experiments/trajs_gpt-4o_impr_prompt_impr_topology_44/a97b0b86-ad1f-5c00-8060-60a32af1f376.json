In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve the problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Known Costs**:\n   - Chicken meal: $12\n   - Milk: 5 packs at $3.5 each\n\n       \\[\n       5 \\times 3.5 = 17.5\n       \\]\n\n   - Apples: 4 apples at $1.50 each\n\n       \\[\n       4 \\times 1.5 = 6\n       \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost of Known Items**:\n   - Add up the costs of all known items:\n\n       \\[\n       12 + 17.5 + 6 = 35.5\n       \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Payment for the Pizza**:\n   - Subtract the total cost of known items from the total amount Marie paid:\n\n       \\[\n       52.5 - 35.5 = 17\n       \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Pizza Boxes**:\n   - Each pizza box costs $8.50. Divide the remaining amount by the cost per box to find the number of boxes:\n\n       \\[\n       \\frac{17}{8.5} = 2\n       \\]\n\nTherefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. \n\nLet me know if you'd like to discuss this solution further or if there are any other queries."
