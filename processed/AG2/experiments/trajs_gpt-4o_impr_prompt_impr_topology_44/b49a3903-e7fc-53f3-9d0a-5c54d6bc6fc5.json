      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many rows of each type of tulip Jackson will plant, taking into account the constraints given, and then sum up these rows.\n\n1. **Red Tulips:**\n   - Jackson has 36 red tulips.\n   - He can fit 6 red tulips per row.\n   - Therefore, he will plant \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) rows of red tulips.\n\n2. **Blue Tulips:**\n   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips.\n   - He can fit 8 blue tulips per row.\n   - Therefore, he will plant \\( \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\) rows of blue tulips.\n\n3. **Yellow Tulips:**\n   - Jackson buys 30 yellow tulips.\n   - He can fit 5 yellow tulips per row.\n   - Therefore, he will plant \\( \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\) rows of yellow tulips.\n\n4. **Total Arrangement:**\n   - Jackson plants a row of yellow tulips between every row of red and blue tulips.\n   - There are 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.\n   - Assuming he places a yellow row between each red and blue row (the problem states he adds a row of yellow between every row of red and blue, which we interpret as between each complete \"block\" of red or blue):\n\nLet's arrange them:\n   - Begin with a red block of 6 rows: R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6\n   - Place a yellow row after each block of red rows: Between red and blue blocks, meaning before any start of a blue block\n   - Then blue block of 3 rows: B1, B2, B3\n   - Place yellow rows: After each block transition\n\nPreviously, I reasoned it should be arranged as:\n- Red: 6 rows\n- Yellow row after red and before blue, which accounts for 1 single block separator: 1 row\n- Blue: 3 rows\n- Total yellow rows used in block than separators would be integrated rather than separately\n\n**Total**: \n  - 6 (red) + 1 (single set separator for a block transition) + 3 (blue) = 10 rows.\n\nJackson will plant a total of 10 rows of flowers."

The initial proposal discussed by both agents eventually led to confusion about total yellow rows, producing conflicting interpretations initially.\n\nUpon reviewing:\n\n1. **Red Tulips:** 6 rows of 6 red tulips\n2. **Yellow Tulips:** 6 rows of 5 yellow tulips, intended for 1 introductory and others slots (when blocks cross each sequential arrangement between substantial types).\n3. **Blue Tulips:** 3 rows of 8 blue tulips\n\n**Additions:**\n- Yellow row separation concept was originally: add after each full transition/segment:\n\nA coherent solution includes beginning:\n- Initial support ensures span or depicting after the initial red end before blue begins.\n\nFinal Sum Checked:\n\n- 6 Rows (Red) + 6 Yellow Rows + 3 Blue Rows = 15 combined blocks utilizing available previously.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{15}** to reflect the crunch of identity being evident through constraint end sequence clarifications."
