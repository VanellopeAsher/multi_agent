Two-thirds of Scottish unicorns are female, and the number of female unicorns in Scotland is given as 6. Thus, we can determine the total number of unicorns in Scotland:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times S = 6 \\implies S = 9\n   \\]\n   So, there are 9 unicorns in total in Scotland.\n\n2. A third of all unicorns worldwide are in the Scottish Highlands, giving us:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times T = 9 \\implies T = 27\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 27 unicorns worldwide.\n\n3. The remaining unicorns in the world, outside of Scotland, is:\n   \\[\n   T - S = 27 - 9 = 18\n   \\]\n\nConsequently, the number of unicorns left in the world, outside of Scotland, is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{18}**"
