In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break down the relationship between robots, helmets, and footballs.\n\n1. **Understand the Relationships**:\n   - The number of helmets is given as 2000.\n   - The number of robots is half the number of helmets. So, the number of robots = 2000 / 2.\n   - The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Hence, the number of footballs = 2000 * 2.\n\n2. **Calculate Each Item Count**:\n   - Number of helmets = 2000\n   - Number of robots = 2000 / 2 = 1000\n   - Number of footballs = 2000 * 2 = 4000\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Items**:\n   - Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs\n   - Total number of items = 1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000\n\nTherefore, Dominick saw a total of 7000 items in the changing room."
