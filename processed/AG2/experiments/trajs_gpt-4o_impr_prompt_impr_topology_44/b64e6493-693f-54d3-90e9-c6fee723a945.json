      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Colby has and determine how many gumballs he can buy with that amount.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the Value of Each Type of Coin in Cents**:\n    - Quarters: 1 quarter = 25 cents\n    - Dimes: 1 dime = 10 cents\n    - Nickels: 1 nickel = 5 cents\n    - Pennies: 1 penny = 1 cent\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Value of Each Type of Coin**:\n    - Total value of quarters = 80 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 2000 cents\n    - Total value of dimes = 60 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 600 cents\n    - Total value of nickels = 140 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 700 cents\n    - Total value of pennies = 150 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 150 cents\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Amount of Money Colby Has**:\n    - Total money = Total value of quarters + Total value of dimes + Total value of nickels + Total value of pennies\n    - Total money = 2000 cents + 600 cents + 700 cents + 150 cents = 3450 cents\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Gumballs Colby Can Buy**:\n    - Cost of each gumball = 5 cents\n    - Number of gumballs Colby can buy = Total money / Cost of each gumball\n    - Number of gumballs Colby can buy = 3450 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 690 gumballs\n\nTherefore, Colby can buy 690 gumballs."
