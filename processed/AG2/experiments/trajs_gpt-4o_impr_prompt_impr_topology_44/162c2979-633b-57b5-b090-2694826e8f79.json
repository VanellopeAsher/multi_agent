Here's how this can be broken down:\n\n1. **Strawberry Gum Packs:**\n   - Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum.\n   - Each pack costs $2.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the strawberry gum is:  \n     \\[ 2 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$2/\\text{pack} = \\$4 \\]\n\n2. **Grape Gum Pack:**\n   - Suzie bought one pack of grape gum.\n   - It cost her $2 for this pack.\n   - Therefore, the cost for the grape gum is:  \n     \\[ \\$2 \\]\n\n3. **Green Apple Gum Pack:**\n   - Suzie bought one pack of green apple gum.\n   - It cost half as much as the grape gum. Since the grape gum was $2, the green apple gum is:  \n     \\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$2 = \\$1 \\]\n\nNow, we sum these amounts to find the total cost Suzie paid for all the gum packs:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\$4 \\,(\\text{Strawberry}) + \\$2 \\,(\\text{Grape}) + \\$1 \\,(\\text{Green Apple}) = \\$7 \\]\n\nThus, Suzie paid a total of $7 in all."
