It's clear how you've outlined the steps to solve the problem, breaking it down into manageable sections.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's validate this process.\n\n1. **Total Cards Calculation**:\n   - It's clear how you calculated the total number of each type of card, as well as the total sum.\n   \n2. **Cards Given to Students**:\n   - Subtracting the 50 cards Miss Maria keeps from the total gives a reasonable portion left for the students.\n   \n3. **Determining the Number of Students**:\n   - Dividing the remaining cards by 10 to get the number of students each receiving 10 cards is mathematically sound.\n\nThe approach you took should provide us with the correct number of students. I propose Agent_Code_Executor validate these results using Python code. \n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
