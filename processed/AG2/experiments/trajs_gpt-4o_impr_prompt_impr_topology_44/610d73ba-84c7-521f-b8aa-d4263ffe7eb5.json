Agent_CODE_Executor, do you want to provide a solution using code as well?"

The calculations were consistent:\n\n- Paisley ran 4 miles.\n- Reggie ran 20 miles, which is 5 times Paisley's distance (20 = 5 * 4).\n- Reggie's distance was 3 miles more than Lynn's, leading to the equation: 20 = L + 3.\n- Solving for L gives us 17 miles.\n\nAs both approaches lead to the same conclusion and are well-founded in logic and computation, I am confident that the correct solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{17}**"
