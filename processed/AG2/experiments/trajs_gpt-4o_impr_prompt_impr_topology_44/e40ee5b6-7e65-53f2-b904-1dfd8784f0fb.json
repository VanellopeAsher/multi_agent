      "content": "Here is the solution to the problem:\n\n1. **Determine the price of a half-gallon jar**:\n   - We know that a one-gallon jar is priced $2 higher than a half-gallon jar, and the price of a one-gallon jar is $5.\n   - So, let \\( x \\) be the price of the half-gallon jar.\n   - Therefore, we have the equation: \\( x + 2 = 5 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( x \\): \\( x = 5 - 2 = 3 \\).\n   - Thus, the price of a half-gallon jar is $3.\n\n2. **Calculate the total expenditure for one-gallon jars**:\n   - Cecelia purchased 10 one-gallon jars.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the one-gallon jars is: \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the total expenditure for half-gallon jars**:\n   - Cecelia purchased 16 half-gallon jars.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the half-gallon jars is: \\( 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Sum up the total expenditure**:\n   - Total expenditure on both one-gallon and half-gallon jars: \\( 50 + 48 = 98 \\) dollars.\n\nHence, Cecelia expended a total of $98 on purchasing 10 jars of one gallon and 16 jars of half a gallon. \n\nLet's discuss this solution to ensure accuracy and consensus."
