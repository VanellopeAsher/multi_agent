In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Now, let's discuss this with the other agents."

Identify that 20 students represent one-third of the students without either a desktop or a laptop.\n2. Calculate the total number of students without both by solving the equation \\( \\frac{1}{3}x = 20 \\), giving \\( x = 60 \\).\n3. Relate this to those without just a desktop by knowing that's one-fourth of the total number of students, setting up the equation \\( \\frac{1}{4}N = 60 \\), and solving for \\( N \\).\n\nBoth solutions yield the same final result for the total number of students: **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{240}**."
