      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the monthly payment for each debt when paying 50% more than the minimum. Then, we will find the total amount paid in a year by multiplying the monthly payments by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).\n\n1. **Calculate the enhanced monthly payment for each debt**:\n   - Student loans: Minimum payment is $3000. Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Student loans monthly payment} = 3000 + (0.5 \\times 3000) = 3000 + 1500 = 4500\n     \\]\n   - Credit cards: Minimum payment is $2000. Jessica wants to pay 50% more:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Credit cards monthly payment} = 2000 + (0.5 \\times 2000) = 2000 + 1000 = 3000\n     \\]\n   - Mortgage: Minimum payment is $5000. Jessica wants to pay 50% more:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mortgage monthly payment} = 5000 + (0.5 \\times 5000) = 5000 + 2500 = 7500\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the total monthly payment**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total monthly payment} = 4500 + 3000 + 7500 = 15000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total payment for the year**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total payment per year} = 15000 \\times 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total payment per year} = 180000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays $180,000 in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts."

Let me calculate the required total payment for a year based on the conditions given in the problem. \n\n```python\n# Constants: Minimum payments\nstudent_loan_min = 3000  # Student loan minimum monthly payment\ncredit_card_min = 2000   # Credit card minimum monthly payment\nmortgage_min = 5000      # Mortgage minimum monthly payment\n\n# Each debt payment increased by 50%\nstudent_loan_payment = student_loan_min * 1.5\ncredit_card_payment = credit_card_min * 1.5\nmortgage_payment = mortgage_min * 1.5\n\n# Total monthly payment\ntotal_monthly_payment = student_loan_payment + credit_card_payment + mortgage_payment\n\n# Calculate annual payment\ntotal_annual_payment = total_monthly_payment * 12\ntotal_annual_payment\n```\n\nBy executing this code, we find that the total annual payment is $180,000. \n\nTherefore, if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, she will pay a total of $180,000 per year."

Calculate the 50% more payment on each debt:\n   - Student Loans: $3,000 + 50% of $3,000 = $4,500 per month.\n   - Credit Card: $2,000 + 50% of $2,000 = $3,000 per month.\n   - Mortgage: $5,000 + 50% of $5,000 = $7,500 per month.\n\n2. Total Monthly Payment: $4,500 (Student Loans) + $3,000 (Credit Card) + $7,500 (Mortgage) = $15,000.\n\n3. Total Annual Payment: $15,000 per month * 12 months = $180,000 per year.\n\nBoth agents have arrived at the same conclusion using correct calculations. Therefore, the solution is confirmed to be correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{180000}**"
