      "content": "To find the increase in the amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we first need to determine the amount of water flowing through the river on the first and second days and compare it to the amount on the third day.\n\n1. **First Day**: The water flow is 4000 gallons.\n\n2. **Second Day**: After heavy rain, the flow doubles. Therefore, the flow is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Day**: The total flow is given as 14000 gallons.\n\nTo find the increase from the second day to the third day, we subtract the amount of water flowing on the second day from the amount on the third day:\n\\[\n14000 - 8000 = 6000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the increase in the amount of water on the third day is 6000 gallons. \n\nThis solution is straightforward since it involves understanding simple differences in flow amounts across the days, emphasizing basic arithmetic operations."
