      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the information given**:  \n   - The Smith twins found 30 eggs each. Since there are two twins, this means the Smith twins found a total of \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\) eggs.\n   - It is stated that all eggs except 10 were found by the friends. This implies that 10 eggs were not found by anyone.\n\n2. **Formulate an equation**:  \n   - Let \\( x \\) be the total number of eggs. From the problem statement, we know that the total number of eggs minus the number of eggs not found is equal to the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and their friends.\n   - So, \\( x - 10 = \\text{(eggs found by Smith twins)} + \\text{(eggs found by friends)} \\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of eggs found by friends**:  \n   - We know the Smith twins found 60 eggs. Therefore:  \n     \\[\n     x - 10 = 60 + \\text{(eggs found by friends)}\n     \\]\n   - The problem asks for how many eggs the friends found, so the expression simplifies to solving for \\((x - 10) - 60\\).\n\n4. **Solve for the number of eggs found by friends**:\n   - Since 10 eggs were not found:  \n     \\[\n     x - 10 = 60 + \\text{(eggs found by friends)}\n     \\]\n   - Rearrange to find the eggs found by friends:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{(eggs found by friends)} = x - 10 - 60\n     \\]\n     Since all other eggs besides the ones not found and those found by the twins are found by the friends, let’s reassume:\n   - Since the 10 not found were indeed part of a total quantity where the rest were found and Smith's have 60:\n   \n   - Thus the friends found a total of \\( x - 70\\), that’s an expression involving \\( x \\), which \\( x\\) cancels being prompted by residuals independency.\n\nSo, the number of eggs the friends found is 0, given only 60 found by twins, and 10 accounted for those neither Friend nor twin found explicitly by prompt deduction."
