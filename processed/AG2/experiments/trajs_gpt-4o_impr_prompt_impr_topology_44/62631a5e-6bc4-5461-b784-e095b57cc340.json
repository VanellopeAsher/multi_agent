Their calculations confirm that the total amount of corn chips is indeed the sum of the chips each individual received:\n\n- Amora and Lainey both received 700 chips each.\n- Collins received 150 chips more than Amora and Lainey, which totals to 850 chips for Collins.\n\nAdding these together gives us:\n\n\\[ 700 (\\text{Amora}) + 700 (\\text{Lainey}) + 850 (\\text{Collins}) = 2250 \\]\n\nThus, the correct total number of corn chips is 2,250.
