Therefore, 50% of the total paint is yellow:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yellow paint} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remainder for Other Colors**: The remaining 6 pints (12 - 6) are divided equally among red, white, and purple paints.\n\n4. **Calculate Paint per Color**: Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount of red paint} = \\text{Amount of white paint} = \\text{Amount of purple paint} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\nThus, 2 pints of red paint were used in the mural."
