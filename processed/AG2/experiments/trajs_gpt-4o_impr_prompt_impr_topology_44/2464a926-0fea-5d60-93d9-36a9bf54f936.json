      "content": "**Document Your Solution**\n\nTo solve the problem of determining how many balloons were used during Jolene and her friends' water balloon fight, we can employ the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Total Number of Balloons Prepared:**\n   - There are 10 sets of balloons.\n   - Each set contains 30 balloons.\n   - Therefore, the total number of balloons prepared is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 30 = 300\n     \\]\n\n2. **Identify the Number of Balloons Remaining:**\n   - At the end of the afternoon, there are 12 balloons left.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Balloons Used:**\n   - The number of balloons used is equal to the total number of balloons prepared minus the number of balloons remaining:\n     \\[\n     300 - 12 = 288\n     \\]\n\nThus, the solution to the problem is that 288 balloons were used during the water balloon fight.\n\n**Engage in Discussion**\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of this solution, let's verify the computations and logic with each other. Please share any insights or suggestions regarding this solution."
