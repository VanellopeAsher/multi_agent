Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10.5 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon.

If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

      "content": "To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.\n\nLet's break down each item cost step by step:\n\n1. **Bacon**:\n   - Total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.5.\n   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is $10.5 / 5 = $2.1.\n\n2. **Chicken**:\n   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\n   - Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is $2.1 * 2 = $4.2.\n   - Total cost for 6 packets of chicken is 6 * $4.2 = $25.2.\n\n3. **Strawberries**:\n   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.5.\n   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4.5 = $13.5.\n\n4. **Apples**:\n   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.\n   - Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is $4.5 / 2 = $2.25.\n   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples is 7 * $2.25 = $15.75.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total expenditure:\n- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples\n- Total cost = $10.5 + $25.2 + $13.5 + $15.75 = $64.95\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to determine the money left in her budget:\n- Money left = $65 - $64.95 = $0.05\n\nTherefore, Kelly has $0.05 left in her budget."
