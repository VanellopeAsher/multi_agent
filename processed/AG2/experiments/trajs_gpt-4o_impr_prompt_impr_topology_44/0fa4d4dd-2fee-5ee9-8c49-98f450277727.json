      "content": "To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Cost of Purchases**:  \n   - Jacket cost: $120  \n   - Two pairs of shoes, each costing $100: \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\)  \n   - Total cost of jacket and shoes: \\(120 + 200 = 320\\)\n\n2. **Calculate Total Earnings from Babysitting**:  \n   - Babysitting earnings per session: $5  \n   - Total number of babysitting sessions: 10  \n   - Total earnings from babysitting: \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Savings Before Mowing Lawn**:  \n   - Initial savings: $100  \n   - Total savings after babysitting: \\(100 + 50 = 150\\)\n\n4. **Determine Remaining Money Needed**:  \n   - Total cost of the jacket and shoes: $320  \n   - Total savings: $150  \n   - Remaining amount needed: \\(320 - 150 = 170\\)\n\n5. **Calculate Number of Times Sara Must Mow the Lawn**:  \n   - Earnings per lawn mowing session: $10  \n   - Number of times to mow the lawn: \\(\\lceil \\frac{170}{10} \\rceil = 17\\)\n\nTherefore, Sara must mow the lawn 17 times to earn enough money for the jacket and shoes.\n\nDiscussion: Essentially, this breakdown involves calculating all current earnings and savings and determining the additional amount needed (after current earnings, including babysitting), then dividing this by the amount each mowing session contributes. If the division isn't exact, taking the ceiling ensures Sara earns at least the amount needed."

Here are the steps they used to determine the solution:\n\n1. Calculated the total cost of the jacket and shoes: $120 (jacket) + $200 (two pairs of shoes) = $320.\n2. Added Sara's initial savings ($100) and her earnings from babysitting ($50 from 10 sessions at $5 each), totaling $150 in savings.\n3. Determined that Sara needed an additional $170 ($320 - $150) to purchase the jacket and shoes.\n4. Calculated that Sara must mow the lawn 17 times to earn the remaining $170, as she earns $10 per mowing session.\n\nSince both solutions align and are consistent with the given problem statement and no assumptions were made, the final solution can be stated as:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{17}**"
