      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Convert Feet to Inches**: \n   - Since Tracy used a wire that is 4 feet long, and we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we need to convert the total length from feet to inches.\n   - Therefore, \\(4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches per foot} = 48 \\text{ inches}\\).\n\n2. **Divide Total Inches by Number of Pieces**:\n   - Tracy obtained 8 equal pieces from the 48 inches of wire.\n   - To find the length of each piece, divide the total length of the wire by the number of pieces: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{48 \\text{ inches}}{8 \\text{ pieces}} = 6 \\text{ inches per piece}\n   \\]\n\nSo, each piece is 6 inches long."
