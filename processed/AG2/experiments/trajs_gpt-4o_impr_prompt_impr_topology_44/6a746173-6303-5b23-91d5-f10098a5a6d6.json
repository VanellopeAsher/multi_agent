Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Neighbors' Contribution**: Walter collected $300 from his neighbors.\n\n2. **Online Fund Contribution**: Walter collected $1200 from the online fund.\n\n3. **Total Collected Without Lawyer's and Friend's Contribution**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total without Lawyer and Friend} = \\text{Neighbors' Contribution} + \\text{Online Fund Contribution} = 300 + 1200 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Friend's Contribution**: Before considering the lawyer's donation, Walter's friend contributes $120.\n\n5. **Total Contribution Before Lawyer**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Before Lawyer} = \\text{Total without Lawyer and Friend} + \\text{Friend's Contribution} = 1500 + 120 = 1620\n   \\]\n\n6. **Lawyer's Contribution**: Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lawyer's Contribution} = 3 \\times \\text{Total Contribution Before Lawyer} = 3 \\times 1620 = 4860\n   \\]\n\nHence, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $4860."
