      "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of each colored square on Brittany's comforter and then find out how many fewer white squares there are compared to green squares. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of red squares:**\n   - We know there are 14 red squares.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of blue squares:**\n   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.\n   - Number of blue squares = Red squares + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of green squares:**\n   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.\n   - Number of green squares = Blue squares + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.\n\n4. **Determine the total number of colored squares so far:**\n   - Total colored squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares\n   - Total colored squares = 14 + 18 + 24 = 56 squares.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of white squares:**\n   - The comforter is 68 square feet, which means it has 68 squares in total.\n   - Number of white squares = Total squares - Total colored squares\n   - Number of white squares = 68 - 56 = 12 white squares.\n\n6. **Calculate how many fewer white squares there are than green squares:**\n   - Difference = Green squares - White squares\n   - Difference = 24 - 12 = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares."

Total colored squares (red, blue, green) = 56.\n5. Total squares on the comforter is 68, leaving 12 white squares (68 - 56).\n6. The difference between green and white squares is 12 (24 - 12).\n\nThus, the number of white squares that are fewer than green squares is indeed 12.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{12}**"
